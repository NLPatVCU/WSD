Changes to supervised disambiguation programs:

(1)    Added --ngramcount, --cuicount and --stcount options 
       replacing --unigram, --bigram, --trigram, --cui and --st. 
       This now allows us to use all the functionality of 
       NSP's count.pl program for not only ngrams but cuis 
       and semantic types as well.

(2)    Added --ngrammeasure, --ngramstat, --cuimeasure, --cuistat, 
       --stmeasure and --ststat which utilizes the NSP statistic.pl
       program for feature selection

(3)    Added the MeSH terms (--mesh) feature 

(4)    Added confidence and standard deviation information 
       to our --cv option

(5)    Added a test option   
     
(6)    Added a --lc option to be used with the --ngramcount 
       options - it lowercases all of the words

(7)    Updated the mm2plain file to allow for input data that 
       does not contain the <head> tags

(8)    Added a --nspconfig option to all for multiple calls of 
       --ngramcount, --cuicount and --stcount 

(9)    Added a --javaparam in order to change the size of the 
       java virtual machines memory

(10)   Noticed --wekaparam wasn't working correctly - fixed it
       You can now use the -s NUM option t set the random number 
       seed for cross-validation

(11)   Added the --conflatedcui option so rather than taking the 
       top CUI if there exist more than one possible CUI in the 
       MetaMap or MMTx output - we push them together creating 
       one large CUI and use that as a feature.

(12)   Removed plain2mm program and replaced it with plain2prolog
       so now to the get the mm format you need to run plain2prolog 
       and then prolog2mm - this reduced the redundancy in my 
       various programs
