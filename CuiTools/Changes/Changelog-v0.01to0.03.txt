University of Minnesota 

(1)	Modified the package to be more generalizable. 

(2)	Renamed anything that was 'xml' to 'mm' since the files were not
	technically xml.

(3)	Added more information into the .mm format to keep better track 
	of the sentence and phrasal information that surrounds the target 
	word

(4)	Added program plain2mm.pl which converts plain text to 
	the CuiTools xml-like .mm format

(5)	Added program sval2plain.pl to convert Senseval2 data into plain

(6)	Allowed --cui --unigram --st and --relation information be obtained 
	at the context, sentence or phrase level.
