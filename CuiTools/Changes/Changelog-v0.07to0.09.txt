University of Minnesota 

(1)    Added nlm2mm program that converts the NLM-WSD data 
       set to mm format using information from MMTx rather 
       than the dataset itself. 

(2)    Added test cases for the nlm2mm program

(3)    Changed the environment variable METAMAPHOME back to 
       MMTX_PATH - so it is like the MMTx documentation.

(4)    Moved makedata.sh Demo to make-originalNLM-data.sh

(5)    Added make-MMTxNLM-data.sh Demo for the nlm2mm program.
