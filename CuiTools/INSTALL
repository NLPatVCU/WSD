NAME
    INSTALL - [documentation] How to install CuiTools

SYNOPSIS
     perl Makefile.PL

     make

     make test

     make install

DESCRIPTION
  Prerequisites
    CuiTools REQUIRES that the following software and data set to be
    download and installed. Now having stated that the following is required
    if you would like to run all the programs in CuiTools. If you are only
    interested in running the supervised or unsupervised portions of
    CuiTools, I have annotated which software and data is needed for each of
    them.

    More details on how to obtain and install appear below.

    --Programming Languages

      - Required for both unsupervised and supervised disambiguation
        Perl (version 5.8.5 or better)

      - Required for unsupervised-disambiguate.pl

        Math::SparseMatrix;
        UMLS::Interface

    --Additional Packages

      - Required for unsupervised-disambiguate.pl
        MetaMap package

      - Required for supervised-disambiguate.pl
        WEKA Data-mining package

    --Data (Optional)

      - Not required at all 
        NLM-WSD data set (PMID Version)
        Senseval data

    Remember there are ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES that need to be set for these
    packages. Remember to set the following ones:

        1. CUITOOLSHOME
        2. WEKAHOME
        3. METAMAP_PATH
        4. NLMWSDHOME

    For example:

      # in cshell
      setenv CUITOOLSHOME /home/btmcinnes/CuiTools

      # in bash
      export CUITOOLSHOME=/home/btmcinnes/CuiTools

    This can be added to your .cshrc or .bashrc file

  Installing
    If you have the super-user access, then you can install CuiTools into
    system directories via : perl Makefile.PL make make install make clean

    The exact location of where CuiTools will be installed depends on your
    system configuration. A message will be printed out after make install
    telling your exactly where it was installed.

     You will often need root access/superuser privileges to run
    make install. The module can also be installed locally. To do a local
    install, you need to specify a PREFIX option when you run 'perl
    Makefile.PL'. For example,

     perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/btmcinnes

    or

     perl Makefile.PL LIB=/home/btmcinnes/lib PREFIX=/home/btmcinnes

    will install UMLS-Interface into /home/btmcinnes. The first method above
    will install the modules in /home/btmcinnes/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3
    (assuming you are using version 5.8.3 of Perl; otherwise, the directory
    will be slightly different). The second method will install the modules
    in /home/btmcinnes/lib. In either case the executable scripts will be
    installed in /home/btmcinnes/bin and the man pages will be installed in
    home/btmcinnes/share.

    Warning: do not put a dash or hyphen in front of PREFIX, LIB or WNHOME.

    In your perl programs that you may write using the modules, you may need
    to add a line like so

     use lib '/home/btmcinnes/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3';

    if you used the first method or

     use lib '/home/btmcinnes/lib';

    if you used the second method. By doing this, the installed modules are
    found by your program. To run supervised-disambiguate.pl program, you
    would need to do

     perl -I/home/btmcinnes/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3 supervised-disambiguate.pl

    or

     perl -I/home/btmcinnes/lib

    Of course, you could also add the 'use lib' line to the top of the
    program yourself, but you might not want to do that. You will need to
    replace 5.8.3 with whatever version of Perl you are using. The preceding
    instructions should be sufficient for standard and slightly non-standard
    installations. However, if you need to modify other makefile options you
    should look at the ExtUtils::MakeMaker documentation. Modifying other
    makefile options is not recommended unless you really, absolutely, and
    completely know what you're doing!

    NOTE: If one (or more) of the tests run by 'make test' fails, you will
    see a summary of the tests that failed, followed by a message of the
    form "make: *** [test_dynamic] Error Y" where Y is a number between 1
    and 255 (inclusive). If the number is less than 255, then it indicates
    how many test failed (if more than 254 tests failed, then 254 will still
    be shown). If one or more tests died, then 255 will be shown. For more
    details, see:

    http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Simple/lib/Test/Builder.pm#EXIT_CODES

    Once Downloaded the environment variable CUITOOLSHOME needs to be set to

    For example:

      # in cshell
      setenv CUITOOLSHOME /home/btmcinnes/CuiTools

      # in bash
      export CUITOOLSHOME=/home/btmcinnes/CuiTools

    This can be added to your .cshrc or .bashrc file

  System Requirements
   Programming Languages
    1.  Perl version 5.8 or later.

        This is required for unsupervised and supervised disambiguation.

        Perl is freely available at http://www.perl.org. It is very likely
        that you will already have Perl installed if you are using a
        Unix/Linux based system.

    2.  Perl Data Language (version 2.4.1 or better)

        This is required to use unsupervised-disambiguate.pl.

        CuiTools uses the Perl Data Language (PDL) for efficient
        computations and storage of high dimensional data structures.

        It is available at: http://search.cpan.org/dist/PDL/

        Note that if you have supervisor access on your machine, and have
        the MCPAN Perl module available, you can install PDL automatically
        via:

        perl -MCPAN -e shell > install PDL

        If you do not have supervisor access, you will need to install this
        module locally. Note that you can configure the CPAN module to
        install locally by setting PREFIX and LIB options to directories you
        have read write authority over.

        Note that PDL has quite a few dependencies, and can be tricky to
        install. You may want to check with your system adminstrator and see
        if they can install on your behalf before you tackle the local
        install of PDL. All the other code mentioned here can be locally
        installed quite routinely.

        This is a good description of how to do local installs of Perl
        modules: http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/04/10/mod_perl.html

   CPAN Modules
    1.  Ngram Statistics Package (version 1.01 or better).

        This is required for unsupervised and supervised disambiguation.

        CuiTools uses Text-NSP to select a variety of lexical features.
        Text-NSP is freely available at
        http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-NSP/

        perl -MCPAN -e shell > install Text::NSP

        or manual installation (http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/nsp.html)

    2.  LWP::Simple

        This is required to use supervised-disambiguate.pl

        It is available at: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Math-SparseVector/

        perl -MCPAN -e shell > install LWP::Simple

        or manual installation.

    3.  Config::Simple

        This is required to use supervised-disambiguate.pl

        It is available at: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Config-Simple/

        perl -MCPAN -e shell > install Config::Simple

        or manual installation.

    4.  Math::SparseVector (version 0.03 or better).

        This is required to use unsupervised-disambiguate.pl.

        This is a Perl module that implements sparse vector operations.

        It is available at: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Math-SparseVector/

        perl -MCPAN -e shell > install Math::SparseVector

        or manual installation.

    5.  Math::SparseMatrix (version 0.01 or better).

        This is required for unsupervised-disambiguate.pl

        This is a Perl module that implements sparse matrix operations, in
        particular the sparse matrix transpose operation.

        It is available at: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Math-SparseMatrix/

        perl -MCPAN -e shell > install Math::SparseMatrix

        or manual installation.

    6.  UMLS::Interface

        This is required for unsupervised-disambiguate.pl

        This is a Perl module that connects to the Unified Medical Language
        System (UMLS) stored in a mysql database. If you do not have the
        UMLS in a mysql database, the package contains instructions on how
        to go about doing this.

        It is available at: http://search.cpan.org/dist/UMLS-Interface

        Otherwise, you can install as follows.

        perl -MCPAN -e shell > install UMLS::Interface

   Other Packages
    1.  WEKA Data Mining Package.

        This is required to use supervised-disambiguate.pl.

        Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining
        tasks. CuiTools uses Weka's machine learning algorithms to perform
        supervised word sense disambiguation. Weka is freely available at

                   http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/

        IMPORTANT:

        Once downloaded and installed remember to set the environment
        variable WEKAHOME and add WEKAHOME/weka.jar to your CLASSPATH. This
        is required by Weka as well as CuiTools.

        For example:

          # in cshell
          setenv WEKAHOME /home/btmcinnes/weka/weka-3-5-3
          setenv CLASSPATH $WEKAHOME/weka.jar:$CLASSPATH

          # in bash
          export WEKAHOME=/home/btmcinnes/weka/weka-3-5-3
          export CLASSPATH=$WEKAHOME/weka.jar:$CLASSPATH

        This can be added to your .cshrc or .bashrc file

    2.  MetaMap

        This is required to use unsupervised-disambiguate.pl - or if you
        would like to use the NLM-WSD dataset with the MetaMap assigned CUIs
        - see program nlm2mm.pl

        MetaMap is a freely available from the National Library of Medicine.
        MetaMap maps text to concepts in the UMLS Metathesaurus. The program
        parses the text into components including sentences, paragraphs,
        phrases, lexical elements and tokens. It then identifies possible
        UMLS concepts and chooses the best possible mapping. The information
        that CuiTools uses from MetaMap is the sentence, phrase, and token
        information, part of speech and head information of each token, the
        possible UMLS concepts, the final final mapping concepts and the
        semantic types associated with each concept.

        MetaMap can be downloaded from:

             http://metamap.nlm.nih.gov

        Although MetaMap is free, in order to download this you need to
        register. You can register at: http://umlsks.nlm.nih.gov

        To download:

        When you get to the MetaMap web page, click on the link "Download".
        Scroll down and you will see tar.bz2 files that can be downloaded
        and installed. Click on the 2008 version (not the 2007) for your
        operating system. MetaMap is currently only available for Linux and
        Solaris. If you are a windows users, there is the MetaMap Transfer
        program which can be used instead.

        Once downloaded, go to the installation instructions located here:

             http://metamap.nlm.nih.gov/#Installation

        Note: downloading takes a while (at least it did for me).

        IMPORTANT:

        Once Downloaded the remember to set the environment variable
        METAMAP_PATH to the /bin level directory that store the MetaMap
        programs just downloaded. This is required by MetaMap as well as
        CuiTools.

        For example:

          # in cshell
          setenv METAMAP_PATH /home/btmcinnes/metamap/public_mm/bin


          # in bash
          export METAMAP_PATH=/home/btmcinnes/metamap/public_mm/bin

        This can be added to your .cshrc or .bashrc file

        NOTE:

        The MetaMap command used by this program is:

            metamap10 -q InputFile OutputFile

   Data (Optional)
    1.  NLM-WSD Data Set. The National Library of Medicine's Word Sense
        Disambiguation (NLM-WSD) dataset \cite{WeeberMA01}. The dataset was
        created to promote the study of WSD in the biomedical domain. It
        contains 50 highly frequent ambiguous CUIs from the 1998 MEDLINE
        abstracts. Each ambiguous word in the dataset contains 100 ambiguous
        instances randomly selected. The instances were manually
        disambiguated by 11 evaluators who assigned the ambiguous word to a
        CUI or ``None'' if none of the CUIs described the sense.

        The NLM-WSD data set can be downloaded from:

            http://wsd.nlm.nih.gov

        Although the data set is free, in order to download this you need to
        register. You can register at: http://umlsks.nlm.nih.gov

        To download:

        When you get to the NLM-WSD data set web page, click on the link
        "Access WSD Test Collection (Restricted)"; this is where you need to
        be registered.

        NOTE: There are two versions of the NLM-WSD data set: USE THE PMID
        VERSION! So click on "Switch to PMID identification version of the
        WSD Test Collection".

        There are three files that need to be downloaded.

        The first in the "Basic Test Collection": 1. Basic Reviewed Set

        The second and third in the "Full Test Collection": 2. Common Files
        3. Full Reviewed Result Set

        Unpack the files in a directory called NLM-WSD (for example - you
        can call it anything you would like). You should end up with three
        directories in the NLM-WSD directory: 1. Basic_Reviewed_Results 2.
        common 3. Reviewed_Results

        IMPORTANT:

        Once Downloaded the environment variable NLMWSDHOME needs to be set.

        For example:

          # in cshell
          setenv NLMWSDHOME /home/btmcinnes/NLM-WSD

          # in bash
          export NLMWSDHOME=/home/btmcinnes/NLM-WSD

        This can be added to your .cshrc or .bashrc file

    1.  Senseval Data set.

        Senseval, now called Semeval, are evaluation exercises for the
        semantic analysis of text. One such exercises is word sense
        disambiguation. The Senseval data can be used by the CuiTools
        package. The data from the senseval/semeval evaluations can be
        download from the senseval website:

                         http://www.senseval.org

        Alternatively, Senseval 1, 2 and 3 data can be downloaded in various
        formats from: http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/data.html
