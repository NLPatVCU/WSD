Variation in bronchial responsiveness in the european community respiratory health survey ecrhs attempts to compare bronchial responsiveness between populations have been hampered by between study differences in the pharmacological agent of provocation the method of administration and the summary statistic employed the european community respiratory health survey used methacholine challenge delivered by mefar dosimeter according to a standardized protocol used in 35 centres in 16 countries data were obtained from 13 161 men and women aged 20 44 yrs at the start of the study the dose of methacholine producing a 20 fall in forced expiratory volume in one second fev1 pd20 and the regression coefficient of percentage decline in fev1 with log dose were calculated slope after transformation with and without calibration of nebulizers by weight and adjustment for nonresponse bias standardization for baseline lung function and variation in smoking prevalence was applied to slope results were robust to whichever summary measure was used and to the various adjustments responsiveness was low in iceland and switzerland and in most centres in sweden italy and spain and high in new zealand australia the usa britain france denmark and germany bronchial responsiveness varies considerably in europe and high levels are not confined to the english speaking world
Association between the intima media thickness of the common carotid and subsequent cardiovascular events in subjects 55 years and older in the rotterdam study ergo objective to determine whether common carotid artery intima media thickness imt is related to future cardiovascular disease design nested case control study setting the suburb of ommoord in rotterdam the netherlands method as part of the rotterdam study among 7983 subjects aged 55 years and over ultrasound images of the common carotid artery were stored on videotape of 5965 subjects at baseline 1990 1993 analysis logistic regression was based on 190 cases of cardiovascular disease myocardial infarction and stroke registered up to december 31 1994 imt was measured from videotape for all cases and a control sample of 1373 subjects who remained free from myocardial infarction and stroke during follow up the mean duration of follow up was 2 7 years results the age and sex adjusted cardiovascular disease risk increased by 45 95 confidence interval 95 ci 25 69 per standard deviation increase 0 163 mm in imt stroke risk increased by 45 95 ci 25 69 per standard deviation increase and the risk of myocardial infarction increased by 43 95 ci 16 78 additional adjustment for several cardiovascular risk factors attenuated the association conclusion increased common carotid intima media thickness was associated with subsequent cardiovascular events these results support the use of carotid intima media thickness measurements as a surrogate endpoint in observation and intervention studies the value of imt measurements for individual patients and cardiovascular screening merits further study
Use of toenail fluoride levels as an indicator for the risk of hip and forearm fractures in women the relation between fluoride intake and risk of osteoporotic fractures remains unclear the lack of individual measures of long term fluoride intake has limited epidemiologic studies we used toenail fluoride in this study as a measure of long term intake to evaluate the relation between fluoride intake and subsequent risk of hip and distal forearm fractures between 1982 and 1984 we collected toenail clippings from 62 641 women in the nurses health study who were free from cancer heart disease stroke and previous hip or forearm fracture we identified fracture cases 53 proximal femur and 188 distal forearm through subsequent biennial mailed questionnaires and matched controls to cases on year of birth the odds ratio of hip fracture among women in the highest quartile of toenail fluoride 5 50 parts per million ppm compared with those in the lowest quartile 2 00 ppm was 0 8 95 confidence interval 0 2 4 0 with adjustment for menopausal status postmenopausal hormone use caffeine intake and alcohol consumption the corresponding adjusted odds ratio for forearm fracture was 1 6 95 confidence interval 0 8 3 1 further adjustment for body mass index smoking status and calcium and vitamin d intake did not alter these results
Bayesian calculation of methotrexate clearance after low dose intramuscular administration in patients with rheumatoid arthritis objective to determine a pharmacokinetic procedure bayesian method for estimation of methotrexate mtx clearance using only 2 blood samples in outpatients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with low dose intramuscular i m mtx methods population pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained by the weighted least squares wlsq method in plasma samples from 14 patients with rheumatoid arthritis ra in each patient 11 samples were measured by fluorescence polarization immunoassay at time 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 2 4 6 8 12 and 24 h after i m administration these measures were validated by pharmacokinetic studies in 20 other patients with ra individual total body clearance of mtx was calculated using only 2 plasma samples at 0 5 and 2 h after i m injection by the bayesian method using the population pharmacokinetic parameters the clearance measures obtained by the bayesian method were compared with those obtained by the wlsq method results the pharmacokinetic variables clearance half life area under the curve of 14 patients were determined as well as the covariance and the mean values necessary to apply the bayesian method no significant difference was found between clearance values obtained by the bayesian method compared to the wlsq method confirming the validity of the bayesian values conclusion the present population pharmacokinetic parameters allowed the determination of individual clearance of mtx with only 2 plasma samples 0 5 and 2 h after administration in patients treated with low dose im mtx individual clearance is used to modulate mtx administration in patients presenting adverse reactions in spite of good clinical response individual determination of mtx pharmacokinetics in patients at risk for adverse mtx reactions could be useful for adjustment of the drug regimen
University students adjustment problems considerable information is available on the adjustment problems of first year university students in developed countries but comparatively little is known about such problems in asia and africa this study of a representative sample of 1257 first year students conducted at the university of the north showed that 33 to 85 of the first year students experienced various adjustment problems
Evaluation of dual energy x ray absorptiometry for body composition assessment in rats recent developments in dual energy x ray absorptiometry dxa have rendered feasible the determination of whole body composition in small laboratory animals by directly measuring fat fat free and mineral bone masses our aim was to evaluate this technique by cross calibrating the dxa method with the carcass chemical analysis in a heterogeneous population of nondiabetic wistar and diabetic gk rats 21 animals were used for precision error and reproducibility determinations and 26 were used for accuracy studies we report that this technique is optimized for weights 200 g the respective cv for lean mass fat mass and percentage of fat mass determined in short term or transversal studies was 1 1 0 1 3 0 1 3 and 3 1 0 4 mean sd respectively further this technique is valid for rats weighing from 130 to 200 g by using three successive scans in longitudinal studies daily calibrations significantly increased the percentage of fat mass cv to 6 6 3 3 but it was significantly decreased to 3 0 2 7 by the use of triplicate scans the accuracy for dxa was excellent in reference to the chemical extraction technique r2 0 95 for percentage of fat mass p 0 0001 using an adjustment factor of 0 75 limits of agreement between the two methods for percentage of fat mass 1 7 2 3 mimicry of longitudinal changes in body composition with intraperitoneal injections of saline solution demonstrated a satisfactory detection of body component changes 2 of error for each final component analyzed when increasing total lean mass by 11 8 we conclude that dxa is appropriate for rat whole body composition determination allowing reliable long term follow up of individual animals for the first time
Hospital acquired pressure ulcers risk factors and use of preventive devices background pressure ulcers are a frequent complication of bed rest we examined risk factors for hospital acquired pressure ulcers the use of preventive devices and the impact of case mix adjustments on between ward comparisons methods we conducted 3 cross sectional surveys in a teaching hospital of 2373 patients who had no pressure ulcer on admission we assessed the presence of pressure ulcer dates of admission and ulcer occurrence hospital ward patient age and sex appetite and route of nutrition surgery during stay hospitalization for fracture comorbidities use of low pressure devices special mattresses cushions and pressure reducing beds and the norton pressure ulcer prediction score physical condition mental condition activity mobility and incontinence results two hundred forty seven new pressure ulcers occurred 5 7 per 1000 person days in multivariate analysis the risk for pressure ulcer increased with age risk gradient across 5 categories was 1 4 5 p 001 and norton score across 5 categories risk gradient was 30 fold p 001 other risk factors all relative risks 1 5 1 8 p 002 were hospitalization for fracture surgical intervention reduced appetite and nasogastric tube or intravenous nutrition adjustment for case mix substantially modified differences between hospital wards use of preventive devices was associated with norton score but not all high risk patients benefited conclusions pressure ulcers were seen in every 10th hospitalized adult patient age and norton score were the strongest risk factors for pressure ulcers use of preventive devices was suboptimal adjustment for case mix is essential if pressure ulcer incidence is to be used as an indicator of quality of care
A conceptual framework for nursing management of pain the development of specific nursing based conceptual frameworks help to define and link ideas when performing studies involving a number of different concepts through the use of nursing models and frameworks knowledge gained from nursing research can be more readily disseminated into nursing practice the present framework encompasses nurses knowledge and attitudes about pain management and incorporates the work of many theorists the most prominent being that of brenda conrad this pain management scheme expresses the belief that nurses have a unique and pivotal role in supporting and promoting optimum health states and providing quality life it generates overall goals related to nurse assistance of the patient in the areas of recovery independence adjustment and treatment and emphasises that to meet the patient s needs nurses must possess adequate pain assessment and management knowledge as well as supportive attitudes to provide efficient quality care provision the major supposition emphasised throughout this conceptual framework is that underlying nursing care is a grounded knowledge base fostering genuine care and concern for the welfare of the holistic patient
Coronary event and case fatality rates in an english population results of the oxford myocardial infarction incidence study the oxford myocardial infarction incidence study group objectives to determine coronary event and case fatality rates in an english population aged less than 80 years in oxfordshire and to compare these rates with those reported by the uk monitoring trends and determinants of cardiovascular disease monica centres in scotland and northern ireland and those ascertained in oxfordshire in 1966 67 design a population wide surveillance study conducted in 1994 95 using prospective and retrospective case ascertainment setting a resident population in oxfordshire of 568 800 subjects patients with suspected myocardial infarction or coronary death outcome measures a diagnosis of definite or possible myocardial infarction or coronary death using who monica diagnostic criteria based on symptoms electrocardiograms cardiac enzymes necropsy findings and past medical history results the annual rate for a first or recurrent coronary event per 100 000 population aged less than 65 years in 1994 95 was 273 for men and 66 for women after age adjustment to a standard world population rates in the age group 65 79 years were 1350 for men and 677 for women between 1966 67 and 1994 95 the age standardised event rate in the age group 30 69 years decreased significantly by 33 95 confidence interval ci 44 to 21 in men and there was a non significant reduction of 8 95 ci 33 to 17 in women the age standardised 28 day case fatality rates also decreased significantly by 28 95 ci 41 to 15 in men and by 32 95 ci 55 to 9 in women conclusions the coronary event rate in oxfordshire was much lower than rates reported by monica centres in glasgow and belfast and similar to rates reported by monica centres in france and northern italy the substantially lower event rate accounts for lower coronary heart disease mortality in oxfordshire than in scotland and northern ireland the reduced coronary mortality in this region is attributable to declines in coronary event and case fatality rates
Prospective evaluation of an anemia treatment algorithm in hemodialysis patients current guidelines recommend maintaining the hematocrits of chronic hemodialysis patients in the low to mid 30s maintaining patients hematocrits within a narrow range requires frequent monitoring of their hematocrits and iron studies and periodic adjustment of erythropoietin doses and administration of intravenous iron we designed a simple anemia treatment algorithm to streamline the management of anemia in hemodialysis patients the protocol required formal monthly decisions about the administration of intravenous iron or changes in erythropoietin dose this algorithm was implemented by dialysis nurses and evaluated prospectively for 6 months in a single dialysis unit 30 patients the proportion of patients whose hematocrits were within the desired target 31 to 35 increased from 27 at baseline to 61 during months 4 through 6 of the algorithm conversely the proportion of patients whose hematocrit values were below the target decreased from 46 at baseline to 18 during months 4 through 6 of the algorithm p 0 004 the percentage of patients whose hematocrit values were above the target did not increase the proportion of patients whose transferrin saturation was less than 18 decreased from 47 at baseline to 20 during months 4 through 6 of the algorithm p 0 04 the weekly erythropoietin dose administered decreased from 11 200 1 400 units at baseline to 9 400 1 200 units in month 6 of the algorithm p 0 06 we conclude that a simple anemia treatment algorithm implemented by dialysis nurses is feasible and efficacious and may increase the proportion of hemodialysis patients whose hematocrit values are within the target range without increasing erythropoietin requirements
