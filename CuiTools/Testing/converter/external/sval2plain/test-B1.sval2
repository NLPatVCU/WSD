 whatever flickerings of potential this young tyro possesses they cannot cover up the fact that he is a painter with the imagination of a retarded adolescent no technical mastery no intuitive feeling for pictorial space no sensitivity towards or grasp of tradition and a colour sense rather less than that of congo the chimpanzee who was taught among other things a crude responsiveness to colour harmonies by desmond morris in the late s however potentially educable as a painter schnabel may or may not be his work is just not worthy of serious attention by anyone with a developed taste in this particular art form readers need also to be wary of the existence of special markets the explosive prices for teddy bears in the last few years indicate how a market can be created in this case by a mix of merit and nostalgia what is clearly a dealers market is often signalled by the invention of a brand name to group together a variety of material perhaps rather disparate pop <head>art</head> is an example

 it is fair to say that nothing frank has achieved as a film maker approaches the heights he scaled with the americans the minute film he made for arena suggests why last supper frank on frank looks like a parody of the excesses of sixties avant garde film making on an empty lot between two harlem streets a group of people arrive for an outdoor party to celebrate the new publication of an unnamed author initially they make respectful small talk about him but their comments grow increasingly resentful as it becomes apparent he will not show up some events in last supper appear roughly improvised yet hefty chunks of dialogue are obviously and rather archly staged people say things like ever notice how all <head>art</head> focuses on people in trouble  
 therefore if we carry ourselves with pride our self esteem increases and others will notice if someone does come looking for trouble he or she will pick a victim who does not look capable of causing any real problem we need to make it clear by the way we stand and hold a gaze and by the way we speak that we cannot be so easily dismissed in fact we have to show that we are prepared if necessary to do whatever it takes to survive i'm not talking about aggression but about asserting ourselves firmly and resolutely we can still give our opponent the chance to back off we can still use reason but he or she must realize that the wrong person has been picked for breakfast he may win but at what price countless books and classes teach the <head>art</head> of asserting oneself and if you want to know more turn to page  
 naturally the brighter the white the more it will suit pictures with a modern style so consider choosing at least an off white if not a cream for pictures with an antique flavour however as a general rule you cannot go wrong with the basic colours and if you are in any doubt don't try to use a complicated mix of colours and textures instead keep your background uncluttered for it's the simple pictures that often work the best facing page a selection of blue and pink fabrics for backings below some backing fabrics in autumnal shades although most people are aware of the tremendous selection of fabrics on the market not everyone knows of the vast range of papers that are currently available forsake your usual stationer who probably won't have the room or the reason for stocking unusual papers or cards and go to a specialist <head>art</head> or paper shop instead

 most of the teachers in grammar schools were graduates of universities many but by no means all of them had also taken a one year course of teacher training after completing their undergraduate studies the exceptions were the teachers in such subjects as physical education art and the crafts the domination of the curriculum by subjects classically defined was indeed the most obvious feature of the grammar school curriculum that curriculum needed relatively little adjustment across the pre and post war years the contrast for the eleven year old with the more informal and less specialist work of the primary school was sharp and abrupt english mathematics a foreign language usually french latin often but not always the sciences history geography some <head>art</head> and crafts but not too much pe and games the compulsory religious education these were the invariable components of the first two or three years of a grammar school education  
 i would therefore argue that one of the chief tasks of education perhaps its overriding task is the education and encouragement of a child's imagination so that he may not be a slave to a perception confined solely to the present a perception that is little more than blindness the teaching of history is one part of such an education the encouragement of creativity is another and there are others still after primary school the encouragement of the imagination in children and the cultivation of specifically creative activities has often been thought an optional part of the curriculum a luxury that may have to be dispensed with left in if at all for the less able pupils deemed incapable of serious learning or for that minority determined to reject understanding imagination has been associated especially with the <head>arts</head> and thus in recent years has been increasingly downgraded  
 it was not all going to be wine and roses and leonard again felt the sharp problem of the canadian writer at that time having a small home market not wishing to become artistically part of the of america and yet having nowhere else to go as layton said still regret that we got no encouragement from the cbc because i think that we would have gone on to write plays so it was that they went on to do other things but separately a working relationship was thereby broken up and two highly creative thinkers had their play writing ambitions stillborn this was not in fact the end of leonard's ambitions in that regard in flowers for hitler pp ff he published his new a ballet drama in one act and an involvement in film making would help to sublimate it as we shall see leonard did however manage to get a grant from the canadian <head>arts</head> council

 this connection between painting and the theatre was important to earlier european art in religious as well as secular performances critics no less than artists have wide interests in the arts and may introduce comparisons in their interpretations in the nineteenth century to say that a picture was poetic was a common term of praise in the present century emphasis on formal qualities in the visual arts have made musical comparisons more frequent emphasised by the use by artists of musical terminology as when kandinsky chose to call his works improvisations and compositions according to this formalist approach art aspires to the condition of music a phrase employed by pater but deriving from classical greece clearly artists working in several media have a wide range of references the <head>art</head> critic is thus bound to consider with care what standards of comparison should be used

 latin american art has been undergoing such a review both from within latin america itself and from elsewhere with several exhibitions and books on the subject in the last few years in europe and the us that there should be an issue of the oxford art journal devoted to latin american art is itself testimony to the success of such efforts but new categories can in turn prove to be exclusive within the field of latin american art as a whole there are still many individual artists who have not received the attention they deserve because their work does not seem to fit into any larger pattern in the case of the work of the mexican alberto gironella the reason would seem to be precisely because of his insistent concentration on <head>art</head> of a very different category that of spain during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries particularly court portraiture

 many writers interested in these phenomena tend to specialise either in child play or in the arts the former finding clues in the activity which relate to child development the latter establishing art as an enhancement of what is good and beautiful narrowing the field to either one or the other of these has sometimes trapped the theoreticians into claiming that they have identified a defining characteristic of their field for instance arnaud reid in arguing that what all the variety of art forms have in common is the requirement of explains for cutting straight through the recurring controversies about whether because of the varieties of the <head>arts</head> and of the infinity of differences between different individual works can be one thing i think is clear

 those with a broad view of the university system see another factor as more important that the lowering of standards applies not only to students but also to teachers quadrupling the number of academics in years inevitably led to some appointments of people of the first as some politely express themselves many academics being civil servants have secure jobs guaranteed for life moreover legislation associated with improving workers rights in germany took control many of the important details of university life such as departmental policy and appointments out of the hands of the heads of departments and transferred them to committees of faculty members at all levels in <head>arts</head> and social science particularly this led to appointments made for political rather than academic reasons
