 title Neurotrypsin a novel multidomain serine protease expressed in the nervous system title We have cloned a novel murine cDNA encoding a multidomain serine protease termed neurotrypsin which exhibits an unprecedented domain composition The deduced amino acid sequence defines local a <head>mosaic</head> protein local of 761 amino acids consisting of a kringle domain followed by three scavenger receptor cysteine rich repeats and a serine protease domain Based on comparisons of the primary structure the protease domain belongs to the subfamily of trypsin like serine proteases In situ hybridization revealed that the expression of neurotrypsin in the adult murine nervous system is confined to distinct subsets of neurons The most prominent expression was found in the cerebral cortex the hippocampus and the amygdala Le structures engaged in the processing and storage of learned behaviors and memories Together with the recently obtained evidence that extracellular serine proteases play a role in neural plasticity this expression pattern suggests that the extracellular proteolytic action of neurotrypsin subserves structural reorganizations associated with learning and memory operations

 title local <head>Mosaic</head> open reading frames local in the Arabidopsis thaliana mitochondrial genome title In the mitochondrial genome of Arabidopsis thaliana eight mosaic open reading frames arose by recombination of fragments duplicated from one or more mitochondrial genes These duplications represent unedited sequences suggesting their derivation from genomic DNA rather than RNA Five of the chimeric reading frames contain the information for the N terminus of the original polypeptide and 5 upstream regions These observations suggest that the generation of novel open reading frames in plant mitochondria can occur rather easily by chance extensions of duplicated gene fragments The presence of so many mosaic open reading frames in the normal Arabidopsis thaliana mitochondrial genome suggests that such recombined sequences interfere only occasionally and fortuitously with the peak mitochondrial performance presumably required during pollen maturation and usually do not cause a cytoplasmic male sterile phenotype

 title local <head>Mosaic</head> arrangement local of ganglion cell receptive fields in rabbit retina title The arrangement of ganglion cell receptive fields on the retinal surface should constrain several properties of vision including spatial resolution Anatomic and physiological studies on the mammalian retina have shown that the receptive fields of several types of ganglion cells tile the retinal surface with the degree of receptive field overlap apparently being similar for the different classes It has been difficult to test the generality of this arrangement however because it is hard to sample many receptive fields in the same preparation with conventional single unit recording In our experiments the response properties and receptive fields of up to 80 neighboring ganglion cells in the isolated rabbit retina were characterized simultaneously by recording with a multielectrode array The cells were divided into 11 classes on the basis of their characteristic light responses and the temporal structures of their impulse trains The mosaic arrangement of receptive fields for cells of a given class was examined after the spatial profile of each receptive field was fitted with a generalized Gaussian surface For eight cell classes the mosaic arrangement was similar the profiles of neighboring cells approached each other at the 1 sigma border Thus field centers were 2 sigma apart The layout of fields for the remaining three classes was not well characterized because the fields were poorly fitted by a single Gaussian or because the cells responded selectively to movement The 2 sigma center center spacing may be a general principle of functional organization that minimizes spatial aliasing and confers a uniform spatial sensitivity on the ganglion cell population

 title Computerized simulation of color appearance for dichromats title We propose an algorithm that transforms a digitized color image so as to simulate for normal observers the appearance of the image for people who have dichromatic forms of color blindness The dichromat's color confusions are deduced from colorimetry and the residual hues in the transformed image are derived from the reports of unilateral dichromats described in the literature We represent color stimuli as vectors in a three dimensional LMS space and the simulation algorithm is expressed in terms of transformations of this space The algorithm replaces each stimulus by its projection onto a reduced stimulus surface This surface is defined by a neutral axis and by the LMS locations of those monochromatic stimuli that are perceived as the same hue by normal trichromats and a given type of dichromat These monochromatic stimuli were a yellow of 575 nm and a blue of 475 nm for the protan and deutan simulations and a red of 660 nm and a blue green of 485 nm for the tritan simulation The operation of the algorithm is demonstrated local with a <head>mosaic</head> local of square color patches A protanope and a deuteranope accepted the match between the original and the appropriate image confirming that the reduction is colorimetrically accurate Although we can never be certain of another's sensations the simulation provides a means of quantifying and illustrating the residual color information available to dichromats in any digitized image

 title Drosophila tissue polarity requires the cell autonomous activity of the fuzzy gene which encodes a novel transmembrane protein title The tissue polarity gene fuzzy fy has two roles in the development of Drosophila wing hairs One is to specify the correct orientation of the hair by limiting the site of prehair initiation to the distal vertex of the wing cell The other is to control wing cell hair number by maintaining the integrity of the cytoskeletal components that direct hair development The requirement for fy in these processes is temperature dependent as the amorphic fy phenotype is cold sensitive Analysis local of <head>mosaic</head> wings local has shown that the fy gene product functions cell autonomously We have cloned the fy transcript which encodes a novel four pass transmembrane protein that shares significant homology with proteins encoded by vertebrate cDNAs The fourth putative transmembrane domain does not appear to play a significant role in tissue polarity as it is deleted in a weak fy hypomorph Expression of the fy transcript is developmentally regulated and peaks sharply at the time of wing cell pre hair initiation

 title Epigenetic variation illustrated by DNA methylation patterns of the fragile X gene FMR1 title Genomic methylation patterns of mammals can vary among individuals and are subject to dynamic changes during development In order to gain a better understanding of this variation we have analyzed patterns of cytosine methylation within a 200 bp region at the CpG island of the human FMR1 gene from leukocyte DNA FMR1 is normally methylated during inactivation of the X chromosome in females and it is also methylated and inactivated upon expansion of CGG repeats in fragile X syndrome Patterns of methylation epigenotypes were determined by the sequencing of bisulfite treated alleles from normal males and females and alleles from a family of five brothers who are local methylation <head>mosaics</head> local and are affected to various degrees by the fragile X syndrome Our data indicate that i methylation of individual CpG cytosines is strikingly variable in hypermethylated epigenotypes obtained from a single individual suggesting that maintenance of cytosine methylation is a dynamic process ii methylation of non CpG cytosines in the region studied may occur but is rare iii mosaicism of methylation in the analyzed fragile X males is remarkably similar to that found for the active X and inactive X alleles in normal females suggesting that the methylation mosaicism of some fragile X males reflects similar on and off states of FMR1 expression that exist in normal females iv hypermethylation is slightly more pronounced on fragile X alleles than on normal inactive X alleles of females v the general dichotomy of hypo and hypermethylated alleles persisted over the 5 year period that separated samplings of the fragile X males vi methylation variability was most pronounced at a consensus binding sequence for the alpha PAL transcription factor a sequence that may play a role in regulating expression of FMR1

 title Dilemma of trisomy 20 mosaicism detected prenatally is it an innocent finding title The clinical significance of mosaicism trisomy 20 detected prenatally following amniocentesis remains uncertain due to the rarity of liveborn cases with inconsistent clinical findings the short postnatal follow up and failure in evaluating other fetal tissues for the presence of the trisomy We report on a 15 month old 46 XX chromosome constitution in white blood cells while skin fibroblasts demonstrated trisomy 20 mosaicism 54 by fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH analysis Clinical examination of the baby showed only minor phenotypic signs bilateral epicanthal folds delayed closure of fontanel with no other gross anomalies but demonstrated a considerable developmental delay in gross and fine motor skills along with hypotonicity This is the second oldest described liveborn with trisomy 20 mosaicism confirmed in skin fibroblasts This cytogenetic aberration along with her developmental delay suggests that the two findings are related and that aberration affects various fetal tissues and is not confined to extra embryonic tissue as suggested previously Yet an undiagnosed condition may be the cause of the child's developmental delay Based on this case and following a review of the literature we suggest local that when <head>mosaic</head> trisomy 20 local is identified in amniocytes further evaluation is required Cord blood should be analyzed preferably by FISH During counseling the parents should be advised of an additional risk such as developmental delay even when fetal cord karyotype and detailed ultrasonic scan are normal

 title Clonal boundary analysis in the developing retina local using X inactivation transgenic <head>mosaic</head> mice local title Transgenic mice harboring the lacZ reporter gene on one X chromosome have been used to mark 50 of all retinal progenitors The distribution of clones arising from this population of marked progenitors reveals a conspicuous columnar segregation of clonally related cells indicating that most retinal neuroblasts migrate exclusively radially Against this columnar background of the transgenic retina single cone horizontal amacrine and ganglion cells are observed to transgress clonal borders mixing freely with cells derived from different precursors This tangential dispersion is due to the lateral movement of postmitotic neuroblasts around the time of their differentiation rather than to the dispersion of a proliferative sibling at the time of cell birth Tangential dispersion is suggested to play a significant role in creating the functional architecture of the mature retina being the means by which the orderly spacing or regularity of retinal mosaics is established during development Copyright 1998 Academic Press

 title Two phases of Hox gene regulation during early Xenopus development title We have shown previously that fibroblast growth factor FGF signalling in posterior regions of the Xenopus embryo is required for the development of the trunk and tail via a molecular pathway that includes the caudal related gene Xcad3 and the posterior Hox genes 1 These results have been contested by the work of Kroll and Amaya 2 which shows that Xenopus embryos transgenic for a dominant negative form of the FGF receptor FGF RI express posterior Hox genes normally leading these authors to suggest that the FGFs are not required for anteroposterior A P patterning of the dorsal axis In order to investigate the apparent discrepancy between these studies we have produced Xenopus embryos transgenic for two inhibitors of the FGF Caudal pathway a kinase deficient dominant negative FGF receptor XFD 3 and a domain swapped form of Xcad3 Xcad EnR in which the activation domain of Xcad3 is replaced by the repression domain of the Drosophila Engrailed protein Both of these were introduced as fusions with the green fluorescent protein GFP which allows identification local of non <head>mosaic</head> transgenic embryos local at early gastrula stages by simply looking for GFP fluorescence Analysis of gene expression in embryos transgenic for these constructs indicated that the activation of posterior Hox genes during early neurula stages absolutely requires FGF signalling and transcriptional activation by Xcad3 while the maintenance of Hox gene expression in the trunk and tail during later development is independent of both FGF and Xcad

 title The developmental basis for germline mosaicism in mouse and Drosophila melanogaster title Data involving germline mosaics in Drosophila melanogaster and mouse are reconciled with developmental observations Mutations that become fixed in the early embryo before separation of soma from the germline may by the sampling process of development continue as part of germline and or differentiate into any somatic tissue The cuticle of adult D melanogaster because of segmental development can be used to estimate the proportion of mutant nuclei in the early embryo but most somatic tissues and the germlines of both species continue from samples too small to be representative of the early embryo Because of the small sample of cells nuclei that remain in the germline after separation of soma in both species mosaic germlines have percentages of mutant cells that vary widely with a mean of 50 and an unusual platykurtic flat topped distribution While the sampling process leads to similar statistical results for both species their patterns of development are very different In D melanogaster the first differentiation is the separation of soma from germline with the germline continuing from a sample of only two to four nuclei whereas the adult cuticle is a representative sample of cleavage nuclei The presence of mosaicism in D melanogaster germline is independent of mosaicism in the eye head and thorax This independence was used to determine that mutations can occur at any of the early embryonic cell divisions and still average 50 mutant germ cells when the germline is local <head>mosaic</head> local however the later the mutation occurs the higher the proportion of completely nonmutant germlines In contrast to D melanogaster the first differentiation in the mouse does not separate soma from germline but produces the inner cell mass that is representative of the cleavage nuclei Following formation of the primitive streak the primordial germ cells develop at the base of the allantois and among a clonally related sample of cells providing the same statistical distribution in the mouse germlines as in D melanogaster The proportion of mutations that are fixed during early embryonic development is greatly underestimated For example a DNA lesion in a postmeiotic gamete that becomes fixed as a dominant mutation during early embryonic development of the F1 may produce an individual completely mutant in the germ line and relevant somatic tissue or alternatively the F1 germline may be completely mutant but with no relevant somatic tissues for detecting the mutation until the F2 In both cases the mutation would be classified as complete in the F1 and F2 respectively and not recognized as embryonic in origin Because germ cells differentiate later in mammalian development there are more opportunities for correlation between germline and soma in the mammal than Drosophila However because the germ cells and any somatic tissue like blood are derived from small samples there may be many individuals that test negative in blood but have germlines that are either mosaic or entirely mutant

 title Mosaic distribution of chondroitin and keratan sulphate in the developing rat striatum possible involvement of proteoglycans in the organization of the nigrostriatal system title The striatum of the mammalian basal ganglia is composed of two neurochemically distinct compartments termed patches and matrix that contribute overall local to a <head>mosaic</head> organization local Glycosaminoglycans GAGs the sugar moieties of proteoglycans provide specific spatio temporal guidance cues during the development of several functional neural systems However their distribution within the nigrostriatal system has not been investigated yet Here the immunohistochemical distributions of unsulphated C0S 4 sulphated C4S and 6 sulphated chondroitin C6S and keratan sulphate KS were examined in the developing neostriatum of rat and compared with the distribution of dopaminergic terminals All the chondroitin sulphate CS isomers are homogeneously expressed in the embryonic striatum After birth C0S and C6S reveal the striatal mosaic in being preferentially expressed within the matrix compartment and in boundaries around patches whereas the C4S epitope is present in both compartments with a slight patchy distribution KS expression is detected first in the patches during the early postnatal period and subsequently only in the matrix compartment All these GAG expressions disappear as the brain matures except for C4S which remains high throughout adult life Furthermore studies within the developing medial forebrain bundle reveal that CS isomers but not KS are expressed in and around the dopamine axonal tract but show similar developmental patterns of distribution which do not appear to be specifically associated with the nigrostriatal pathway These results suggest a possible implication of proteoglycans during the development of the striatum and may be useful for understanding the complex cellular and molecular interactions in degeneration and plasticity of the nigrostriatal circuit in Parkinson's disease Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B V

 title An age associated correlation between cellular bioenergy decline and mtDNA rearrangements in human skeletal muscle title Post mitotic tissues such as skeletal muscle develop a tissue bioenergy mosaic during the process of normal aging that eventually culminates into a bioenergetically diverse tissue containing cells ranging in their oxidative phosphorylation capacity from normal to grossly defective local The <head>mosaic</head> local is postulated to develop continuously from birth with the relative proportions of cytochrome c oxidase COX proficient positive and COX deficient negative muscle fibers differing dramatically as a function of age Generally young individuals only display the rare fiber deficient in COX activity while aged individuals show a significantly higher proportion of negative fibers There appears to be a random element governing which cells will be affected Consequently adjacent cells within a given tissue may exhibit vastly differing COX activities Multiple mitochondrial DNA mtDNA deletions also appear to accumulate in skeletal muscle similarly displaying a dramatic disparity as a function of age Our previous findings have indicated that the accumulation of multiple mtDNA deletions along with a concurrent decrease in wild type mtDNA strongly correlates with the age associated decrease in COX activity observed in skeletal muscle Although no definitive associations were established at the cellular level an important prediction arose from this study Cells that accumulate large numbers of mitochondrial mutations and have reduced levels of full length mtDNA would be expected to be severely affected and show reduced COX activity as a consequence Cells that accumulate fewer mutations or retain adequate amounts of wild type mtDNA would be predicted to be less affected or even retain normal oxidative metabolism In order to establish a link associating COX activity to the status of mtDNA within individual fibers we developed single cell extra long PCR XL PCR The procedure was used to assess the relative concentration of full length mtDNA with respect to any mtDNA deletions detected in individual human skeletal muscle fibers of pre established COX activity Single cell XL PCR analysis of COX positive fibers dissected from a 5 year old and 90 year old individual showed that 80 or more of the fibers contained full length mtDNA and few if any mtDNA rearrangements COX deficient or COX intermediate fibers taken from the same individuals by contrast depicted a heterogeneous population of rearranged mtDNA species with no detectable full length mtDNA The data presented here indicates that COX deficient muscle fibers extracted from individuals regardless of age were accompanied by extensive mtDNA rearrangements and reduced levels of full length mtDNA This provides compelling evidence linking mtDNA mutations to COX activity decline in skeletal muscle and has important implications when considering the molecular basis of the aging process Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B V

 title Identifying loci required for follicular patterning using directed mosaics title We have developed local a directed <head>mosaic</head> system local in Drosophila by using the GAL4 system to control the expression of the yeast recombinase FLP in a spatial and temporal fashion By directing FLP expression we show that it is possible to efficiently and specifically target loss of function studies for vital loci to the developmental pathway of interest A simple F1 adult phenotypic screen demonstrated that most adult tissues can be analyzed with this approach Using GAL4 lines expressed during oogenesis we have refined the system to examine the roles of vital loci in the development of the follicular epithelium We have identified essential genes involved in egg chamber organization cell migration and cell shape Further we have used this technique to gain insights into the role of the Drosophila EGF receptor pathway in establishing the egg axes Finally using different UAS FLP GAL4 and existing FRT lines we have built stocks that permit the analysis of approximately 95 of the genome in follicular mosaics

 title Genotype phenotype correlations in type 2 neurofibromatosis NF2 evidence for more severe disease associated with truncating mutations published erratum appears in J Med Genet 1999 Jan 36 1 87 title Blood samples from 125 unrelated families with classical type 2 neurofibromatosis NF2 with bilateral vestibular schwannomas have been analysed for mutations in the NF2 gene A further 17 families fulfilling modified criteria for NF2 have also been analysed Causative mutations have been identified in 54 43 classical families and six 35 of those fulfilling modified criteria Forty two cases from 38 families with truncating mutations had an average age at onset of symptoms of 19 years and diagnosis at 22 4 years Fifty one cases from 16 families with splice site mutations 15 from six missense mutations 18 from six and large deletions 18 from five had an average age of onset of 27 8 years and at diagnosis of 33 4 years Subjects with truncating mutations were significantly more likely to have symptoms before 20 years of age p lt 0 001 and to develop at least two symptomatic CNS tumours in addition to vestibular schwannoma before 30 years p lt 0 001 There were also significantly fewer multigenerational families with truncating mutations Four further truncating mutations were local in <head>mosaic</head> form local and were associated with milder disease than other similar mutations This large study has confirmed the previous impression that truncating mutations are associated with severe disease but caution has to be exercised in using mutation type to predict disease course

 title Mosaicism for full mutation and normal sized allele of the FMR1 gene a new case title The main mutation in fragile X patients is the expansion of the CGG repeat in the first exon of the FMR1 gene associated with hypermethylation of the proximal CpG island An increasing number of atypical cases have been reported showing the coexistence of full mutation and premutated or normal sized alleles These genotypes are more difficult to detect and if a PCR strategy alone is adopted they can be incorrectly identified We report on a fragile X man with severe phenotype and mosaicism for full mutation and a CGG 7 normal allele the shortest fragment reported as yet local in <head>mosaics</head> local This case of mosaicism as other similar cases previously reported suggests that the normal length allele can derive from a deletion during the same early stage of development in which the full mutation expansion also arose

 title DNA ploidy by image cytometry and karyotype in spontaneous abortion title We compared the DNA content DI by cell image analysis with the karyotype and morphological phenotype of paraffin embedded tissues from 51 spontaneous abortions The study included 21 cases with triploid 19 cases with diploid and 11 cases with aneuploid monosomic trisomic or mosaic karyotype Measurements were performed by image analysis on the trophoblastic and stromal cells of chorionic villi using 5 microm thick Feulgen stained sections At least 200 cells were analyzed Results were interpreted using DI ranges of 1 3 to 1 7 for triploid and 0 9 to 1 1 for a diploid profile All 21 cases with a cytogenetically confirmed triploid karyotype had DI values within the triploid range and all 19 cases with a diploid karyotype had DI values within the diploid range All of the trisomies and monosomies also had a DNA mass within the diploid range However eight cases with a triploid karyotype also had a peak in the diploid range one case with a diploid karyotype and one case with a trisomic karyotype each had an additional peak in the triploid range We did not find a morphological correlation either with image analysis or with karyotype We conclude that cell image analysis is a reliable method for detection of triploidy in spontaneous abortions This relatively rapid method allows visual discrimination of the areas to be analyzed avoids the problem of maternal cell contamination and may unmask local <head>mosaic</head> local karyotypes that would go unrecognized by cytogenetic studies alone
