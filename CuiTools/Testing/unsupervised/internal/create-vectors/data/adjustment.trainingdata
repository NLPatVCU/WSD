Calcium intake and blood pressure in elderly women.The authors studied the relative importance of calcium intake as a correlate of blood pressure in a cross-sectional analysis of 6,517 nonblack women aged > or = 65 years from Portland, Oregon;Minneapolis, Minnesota;Baltimore, Maryland;and the Monongahela Valley near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who enrolled in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures in 1986.Dietary calcium intake was measured by using a modified food frequency questionnaire.There were weak associations between total calcium intake and blood pressure, such that each 1,000 mg/day increase in calcium intake was associated with a 1.5 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure (95% confidence interval -2.2 to -0.8, p < 0.0001) and a 0.5 mmHg decrease in diastolic pressure (95% confidence interval -0.8 to -0.20, p < 0.004).After adjustment for confounding variables, total calcium intake continued to have a weak inverse association only with diastolic blood pressure.The multivariate models revealed several stronger independent risk factors for blood pressure, including age, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and level of education (all p < 0.01).The small size of the inverse association between calcium intake and blood pressure limits its biological importance in this population of elderly women.
The reliability of adjustment in strabismus surgery.It has been recommended that the position of the operated muscles be adjusted shortly after strabismus surgery to achieve better alignment on the first postoperative day and thereby ensure satisfactory later alignment.We compared prism cover test measurements on the first postoperative day with measurements within the first few months after surgery to determine whether day 1 measurements remained stable or whether they changed significantly, providing an inaccurate basis for adjustment.Our study found a fairly large variability in the deviation between the first and last day of the study.Eighteen percent of patients varied by 5 to 9D, and 49% differed by > 10D or more.Equally important was the finding that, had an adjustment been made, it would have made the final result worse than without adjustment.Both of these factors would seem to indicate a degree of variability that controverts the predictability of the adjustment procedure.
[Control over the bacteriological quality of preparations for TPN by the sequential sampling technic]A sequential microbiological control was carried out, using a total filtration method, on a sample selected at random from among those prepared on a daily basis and kept at room temperature for twenty-four hours, in order to determine any possible contamination by fungi, bacteria or yeasts.The results obtained were submitted to accumulated sum statistical sampling, the adjustment for which followed a binomial distribution model.For alpha = 0.05, levels of 0.04 and 0.12 respectively were fixed for acceptable quality (NCA) and for rejection (NCR).It was shown that the regulations on work in the unit for the preparation of NPT mixtures is satisfactory, as the latest results obtained are within the NCA established and, as a value, it is sufficiently exacting.The imperative need for routine microbiological control is also made clear, in order to maintain and improve the standard of quality in the section.
[Physical mechanisms of solid-protein interactions in the interface between amorphous silicon carbide and fibrinogen]State of the art in biomaterial research and implant design is a compromise between functionality and biocompatibility.Consequently the results often have disadvantages with respect to both aspects.In regard to biocompatibility the activation of the clotting system by alloplastic materials is of great significance, because it necessitates anticoagulant therapy.Further improvements of implant technology require an understanding of the interactions between blood and implants.Therefore a microscopic model of thrombogenesis at alloplastic surfaces will shortly be presented, which relates thrombogenicity of a material to the electronic structure of its surface.The requirements for high hemocompatibility, which result from this model--especially in regard to the density of states and the conductivity at the surface--are fulfilled by an amorphous alloy of silicon and carbon (a-SiC:H).The advantage of amorphous materials is that they do not obey stoichiometric rules.Thus they allow a continuous adjustment of the electronic parameters without fundamental changes of their mechanical and chemical properties.The theoretical results where checked by total internal reflection intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy (TIRIF) as well as thrombelastography experiments (TEG).In comparison to conventional materials like titanium or LTI carbon the TEG-clotting time of a-SiC:H-coatings is prolonged in excess of 200%.As a consequence a-SiC:H is well suited as a hemocompatible coating material for hybrid structuring of cardiovascular implants.
Personality in recovered depressed elderly.Personality traits in euthymic elderly subjects with and without past histories of major depressive episodes were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R and the Social Adjustment Scale-SR.Recovered depressed subjects were characterized by significantly more personality traits from DSM-III-R Clusters B and C than controls, and they exhibited differences in social adjustment, as well.Subjects who have recovered from depressive episodes may show significant differences in personality and social adjustment that might represent residua of past depression, a trait characteristic, or a risk factor for recurrence.
Effects of bovine leukemia virus infection on production and reproduction in dairy cattle.The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection on production, reproduction and longevity in dairy cattle.The study population was a commercial Holstein dairy herd of approximately 400 milking cows.Cattle were tested for antibodies to BLV at least annually for three years and when culled.Four groups of culled cows were compared: seronegative cows (n = 79), seropositive cows without lymphocytosis (n = 176), seropositive cows with lymphocytosis (> or = 9,000 lymphocytes/microliter) (n = 74), and seropositive cows with lymphosarcoma (n = 29).Seropositive groups of cows were bred more times and had longer calving intervals than seronegative cows.The seropositive groups had greater 305-day ME (mature equivalent) FCM (3.5% fat-corrected milk) per lactation and were older when culled than seronegative cows.However, the percent fat per lactation was greater in seronegative cows.In the last complete lactation, differences in 305-day ME FCM, days open and cull age between groups were reduced and none were significant (p > 0.05).In the cull lactation, only cows with lymphocytosis had reduced milk production relative to seronegative cows, although this difference was not significant.After adjustment for initial production and reproductive values, only seropositive nonlymphocytotic cows were culled at a significantly older age than seronegative cattle.Lymphocytotic cows were culled four months younger on average than nonlymphocytotic seropositive cows.Hence, BLV infected cows had greater milk production on average than uninfected cows.Adverse effects of BLV infection were primarily limited to lymphocytotic cows which were culled earlier and had reduced milk production in the cull lactation.
[A study on phenytoin pharmacokinetics in 15 patients with refractory epilepsy]Monitoring of serum concentration and studying of individual clinical pharmacokinetics of phenytoin (PHT) were made in 15 patients with refractory epilepsy who had taken PHT and other antiepileptic drugs for a long time.The results showed that 10 of them were tolerant to PHT and their effective doses were higher than the routine ones;2 of them showed striking fluctuation of serum PHT concentration within 24 hours;In the remaining patients serum PHT concentration during menstruation was much lower than that during ovulation.According to their different characteristics we gave them reasonable and individualized adjustment in dose and time interval of taking PHT.The seizures of all the patients were controlled satisfactorily.It is suggested that some of the patients with refractory epilepsy may have special PHT pharmacokinetics.
Components of men's well-being at mid-life.This study was designed to examine the correlates of psychological well-being for 75 middle-aged professional men.Based on sex-role convergence and role adjustment theories, three sets of predictor variables (i.e., interpersonal family factors, role adjustment, and extrafamilial interpersonal factors) were hierarchically entered into a multiple regression equation.The well-being outcome was found to be influenced by interpersonal family factors.The role adjustment and extrafamilial interpersonal factors did not account for a significant increase in variance.The best univariate predictors of men's well-being at midlife were perceived closeness to child, perceived closeness to wife, adjustment to the husband role, and number of close friends.
Controlled use of heroin in patients on methadone maintenance treatment.The efficacy of methadone maintenance treatment was evaluated on 93 patients after 10 years of therapy.On the basis of therapeutic compliance, patients were divided into three groups: (a) 40 Total-Agreement subjects on weekly take-home methadone;(b) 28 Partial-Agreement subjects, who regularly attended the clinic daily but presented episodic positive urinalysis;(c) 25 No-Agreement patients, who were absent from the clinic more than twice a month and had a high rate of urinalysis positive for morphine.Statistical analysis, based on social adjustment improvement and criminality rate decrease, divided the 93 patients into 2 distinct categories.The first category, characterized by high social adjustment and low criminality score, included the Total- and Partial-agreement groups.The second, characterized by significantly lower social adjustment and higher criminality score, included all No-Agreement patients.This suggests that methadone treatment was able to dissociate heroin use from low social functioning.It was concluded that, in a condition of adequate compliance the episodic use of heroin is of no harm to patients on methadone maintenance therapy, that is, methadone maintenance treatment permits a controlled use of heroin.
Urine concentration adjustment with a dipstick is dispensable for urinary beta 2-microglobulin screening in children.Single voided urine was collected from 1,699 3-year-olds.The urinary beta 2-microglobulin levels (microgram/l) were measured by ELISA.The frequency of the levels was distributed with a wide base on the right side, even after logarithmic transformation.The upper limits of the 98% confidence interval were 660 micrograms/l for boys and 690 micrograms/l for girls.The values adjusted to a specific gravity of 1,020 in a total of 1,468 urine samples, of which the specific gravity was examined with Nephrosticks L, from 746 boys and 722 girls were similarly distributed, and the upper limits of the 98% confidence interval were 550 micrograms/l for boys and 530 micrograms/l for girls.There was no significant sex-related difference.Of the 14 children who had adjusted beta 2-microglobulin values above the adjusted upper limit of the 98% confidence interval, 11 (79%) had actual levels above the actual upper limit of the 98% confidence interval, 11 (79%) had actual levels above the actual upper limit of the 98% confidence interval.Finally, 2 children (one boy and one girl) proved to have renal disease.In these 2, both the actual and adjusted values exceeded the respective upper limits of the 99% confidence interval.Concentration adjustment appears to be dispensable in the screening for renal disease.In practice, 600 micrograms/l would serve as an actual cut-off level for both sexes with safety.
Certain methods of biomechanical description of various postural adjustment patterns during motoric learning in dogs.Methods for the biomechanical description of spatial displacements of the center of mass of quadruped animal (dog), developed by the authors on the basis of an assessment of the vertical constituents of support pressures, as well as methods for the assessment of the postural adjustment pattern (coefficient of diagonality), are presented in this paper.The results are presented of an investigation of the role of the motor cortex in the accomplishment of the postural adjustment pattern of dogs, reorganized during learning, in the performance of an instrumental movement.
Existential anxiety as related to conceptualization of self and of death, denial of death, and religiosity.82 students completed a questionnaire which measured their existential anxiety as described by Yalom, conceptualization of self and of death, denial of death, and religiosity.For these students, scores on existential anxiety correlated with identity confusion, feeling responsible toward others but fearing emotional closeness with them, seeing people as fundamentally different and not seeing oneself as living on in one's tasks or projects.Their existential anxiety scores were not related to a particular concept of death, but death was more likely to be seen as cold and denied.Their existential anxiety seemed symptomatic of adjustment problems for which religiosity was not helpful.Specific suggestions for further research are made.
[Development in health status of a group of retired subjects in the Paris region according to their practice of physical activity]The relation between physical activity and health among retired people aged 65 and over was studied in a sample of 993 subjects, men and women, living at home in the Paris area and randomly selected from a pension fund roll.In 1982-1983 (T1), 627 subjects were interviewed.Five years later (T2), 464 subjects participated in the survey.Health was measured by the number and types of impairments and disability.The incidence of cardiorespiratory impairment and the incidence of disability were weaker among subjects with physical activity in T1 than among subjects without physical activity.These findings were unchanged after adjustment for age, sex, socioeconomic status, cigarette smoking, body mass index, uncomfortable housing, living alone and hard physical conditions during working life.This result suggests the beneficial effect of physical activity in promoting health among retired people aged 65 and over.
Plasma lipids and lipoproteins in subtypes of stroke.We determined plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in 131 patients (95 males, 36 females, mean age 71 years) 6 months after acute stroke onset.Compared to a reference population, the alterations of plasma lipid concentrations in stroke patients were moderate.However, the stroke patients had higher levels of triglyceride and lipoprotein (a) and lower concentrations of cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol.Patients with different subtypes of stroke showed significant differences when compared with each other by analysis of covariance (with adjustment for age, sex, smoking, hypertension and diabetes).Patients with carotid or vertebral artery disease had the higher levels of cholesterol, triglyceride and apolipoprotein B, whereas high density lipoprotein triglyceride concentrations were higher in patients with cardioembolic infarcts.
Large capillary fluid permeability in skeletal muscle and skin of man as a basis for rapid beneficial fluid transfer between tissue and blood.Our previous studies strongly indicate that the capillary filtration coefficient (CFC) in skeletal muscle and skin of man is much larger than previously believed, or about 0.050 ml min-1 100 ml-1 mmHg-1.The hypothesis that this large capillary fluid permeability is a factor of primary importance for plasma volume control was approached.Experimental hypovolaemia induced by lower body negative pressure (LBNP of 70-95 cmH2O) was associated with a rapid net fluid gain from the studied upper arm into the circulation of 0.17 ml min-1 100 ml-1 tissue.The transcapillary driving force for this fluid transfer, probably caused by adrenergic adjustment of vascular resistance, with a decline of capillary pressure, was relatively small, or 1.7 mmHg on average.CFC was instead very high during LBNP, increasing from a control value of 0.054 +/- 0.004 (SE) to no less than 0.097 +/- 0.007 ml min-1 100 ml-1 mmHg-1, probably reflecting an increased number of effectively perfused capillaries.It is suggested that the large capillary fluid permeability in skeletal muscle and skin of man, with large tissue mass and fluid reservoir, may be of great functional importance for plasma volume control after blood loss and also in other (patho)physiological situations.As demonstrated, it can thus permit rapid transfer of large fluid volumes into the circulation and, perhaps of special importance, with only small transcapillary driving force (capillary pressure decline).
Computer assisted localizer for planning of surgery and intra-operative orientation.There is discrepancy between the exact representation of anatomical structures and tumours in the CT or MRI scan and the more or less accurate intra-operative localisation methods based mostly upon landmarks of the skull and extracerebral space and visible abnormalities of the cerebral surface.To overcome these problems of exact intra-operative localisation a Computer Assisted Localizer (CAL) is presented which allows precise intra-operative orientation without these aids.It consists of a mechanically articulated arm with six degrees of freedom with a high precision digital incremental and an image processor for 3 D data of the head.MRI and/or CT investigation is done pre-operatively with four reference markers fixed on the patient's head.They are visible on the CT or MRI slices and are used as reference points during surgery for adjustment of the device.The co-ordinates of the digitalizer arm tip are projected into the corresponding axial, sagittal and coronal CT slices so that the system simultaneously presents three orthogonal multiplanar CT reconstructions with a reticule indicating the position of the tip of the arm.As the surgeon directs the arm to the region of interest the corresponding CT slices are displayed on the monitor at a rate of 20 slices/sec determined by the motion of the arm.The accuracy of measurement of the device itself lies within 1 mm.The accuracy is somewhat reduced however by the thickness of CT or MRI slices (routinely 2 mm slices were taken) and by deviations of the reference markers on the skin surface which amount up to 3 mm.
Pharmacokinetics and transplacental passage of imipenem during pregnancy.Imipenem pharmacokinetics were studied in early pregnancy (n = 7;length of gestation, 8.6 +/- 1.5 weeks, mean +/- standard deviation), in late pregnancy (n = 7;length of gestation, 38.7 +/- 1.4 weeks), and in the nonpregnant state (n = 6).A single dose of 500 mg of imipenem-cilastatin (1:1) was administered as a 20-min infusion.Multiple plasma and urine samples, as well as specimens of umbilical plasma and amniotic fluid from the pregnant subjects, were collected at frequent intervals for 8 h.Imipenem concentrations were assayed by specific microbiologic assay.The mean peak concentrations in plasma were 14.7 +/- 4.9, 14.9 +/- 5.2, and 43 +/- 28.3 micrograms/ml in early pregnancy, late pregnancy, and the nonpregnant state, respectively.The volumes of distribution were significantly larger during early pregnancy (0.98 +/- 0.45 liter/kg of body weight, P < 0.005) and late pregnancy (0.59 +/- 0.19 liter/kg, P < 0.05) than in the nonpregnant state (0.33 +/- 0.10 liter/kg), and total clearances from plasma were faster in early pregnancy (12.7 +/- 7.8 ml min-1 kg-1, P < 0.05) and late pregnancy (10.7 +/- 4.6 ml min-1 kg-1, P < 0.05) than in the nonpregnant state (5.77 +/- 1.19 ml min-1 kg-1).The mean concentrations in amniotic fluid were 0.07 +/- 0.01 and 0.72 +/- 0.85 micrograms/ml in early and late pregnancy.The mean umbilical venous and arterial drug concentrations were 1.72 +/- 1.22 and 1.64 +/- 1.22 micrograms/ml.The feto-maternal ratio at the time of cesarean section was 0.33 +/- 0.12.These results indicate that an adjustment of doses of imipenem may be required when treating pregnant women because of considerable changes in imipenem pharmacokinetics during pregnancy.
[Efficacy of antihypertensive treatment in the French population.A multicenter survey]In order to assess the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment in the population, a study was undertaken in 5 French cities during the commercial fairs of Grenoble, Marseilles, Nice, Toulouse and Lille.The blood pressure was measured according to the WHO recommendations in volunteers.The study included a total of 7107 subjects of both sexes, with 4064 subjects in the 35-64 year age group.The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in the 791 hypertensive patients who knew their antihypertensive therapy.Taking < 160/95 mmHg as the criterion of efficacy, 52 to 73% of the hypertensive patients were well controlled.However, if the therapeutic objective of normalisation of the blood pressure (BP < 140/90 mmHg) is taken as the criterion of efficacy, only 23 to 29% of the hypertensive patients were controlled whilst their BP remained significantly higher than that of normotensive controls of the same age.The difference in efficacy of antihypertensive therapy between the cities may be explained by the heterogenicity of the populations whereas the treatment did not differ significantly.After adjustment analysis with respect to sex showed that women were better controlled than men whatever the criterion chosen.The group controlled at BP < 160/95 mmHg only differed from the group < 140/90 with respect to the average BP value which was higher before treatment and decreased less with treatment;though this did not achieve statistical significance.In matters of public health, if the ideal blood pressure is taken as < 140/90 mmHg, this study shows that the objective is only attained in one out of four patients in the population studied.
[Effect of family environment on adaptation to the hemodialysis program in patients with chronic renal insufficiency]In our study we have analyzed the influence of family environment on adjustment of renal patients to the HD as well as on the attitude towards kidney transplantation.The study included 57 patients (34 M, 23 F), mean age 52.3 years, and they had been on dialysis for an average of 34.5 months.We obtained information about adaptation and behavior in the care unit, and attitude and motivation towards renal transplantation.Biochemical variables were used to register disruption of medical compliance or dietetic transgression (K, PRC, BUN, weight gain, etc.).The patient's family climate was assessed through use of the Family Environment Scale (FES, Moos and Moos, 1981).The results showed that patients with aggressiveness and noncompliance during HD sessions tended to have high family conflict in family members.The most positive attitudes towards renal transplantation were found in the patients that came from families with the greatest degree of cohesion and expressiveness.In summary, family social climate is a variable influencing outcome of these patients.Its routine assessment would permit the prediction of adaptation to the therapeutic program as much as better efficacy of HD treatment.
[Treatment with naltrexone in opiate dependents: 2 years' follow-up]Outcome of a maintenance treatment with naltrexone (350 mg/week) are examined in a sample of 365 patients with opiate dependence disorder.Treatment was followed in an outpatient facility, in a setting similar to patient's own environment.The average attendance rate was of 198 days.Six months after the onset of the treatment, 52% of the patients still remained drug-free.Results of treatment was correlated with family support, HIV, work adjustment, use of other drugs and partner using drugs.
Effects of mediodorsalis thalamic nucleus lesions on vigilance and attentive behaviour in cats.In this study performed on 10 cats we analysed the effects of limited lesions of nucleus medialis dorsalis of the thalamus (MD) on behaviour and on some specific electrocorticographic (ECoG) patterns, known from previous works to accompany various states of waking attentiveness.The animals were tested during 90 min in three distinct behavioural situations;a neutral one (NS) where they simply explored their environment and then usually went to sleep;a second one (FA) where they could watch a mouse (but not catch it), which favoured 'focussed' attentiveness accompanied by the development of rhythmic ECoG activities in the anterior frontoparietal cortex ('beta rhythms' at 40 Hz);a third one (EX) with a hidden mouse whose appearance the cat was waiting for ('expectancy') which rather than favouring the development of beta rhythms elicited the appearance of another rhythmic activity dominating in somatic area SI, 'mu rhythms' at 14 Hz.The duration of each waking behaviour and its ECoG concomitant as well as that of slow wave and of paradoxical sleep were compared in each cat before and after lesion.Our results showed that MD lesions situated in the posterior part of the nucleus tended to increase the time occupied by focussed attentive behaviour and the accompanying beta rhythms.On the other hand, anteriorly located MD lesions elicited a concomitant reduction of both manifestations, behavioural and electrocortical.No such contrasting effects could be systematically noticed for the durations of expectancy, of slow sleep and of paradoxical sleep.These findings were discussed considering previous data showing that at least two systems project upon MD, that play distinct--in a way even antagonistic--roles in focussed attention upon a target.Both originate from the ventral tegmental mesencephalic area;one reaches MD through the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens), the other one through the amygdala.The MD nucleus thus receiving contrasting information may participate in a final adjustment of the attentive state of the animal to its environment.
A note on sex-specific mortality and social class in Sydney, 1979 to 1983.Simple indicators such as education, income, occupation, and employment status are often used to adjust for social class in studies of morbidity or mortality.The effect of social class on such outcomes can be different for men and women.In population-based studies, residential area may be the only means of assessing social class.This study investigated sex differences in the association between mortality between 1979 and 1983 and several area indices of social class--percentage with a degree, percentage professional, percentage blue collar, percentage unemployed, percentage with annual income greater than $40,000, and the composite indicator constructed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.Thirty-seven Sydney statistical local areas were ranked for men and women separately according to the indicators and standardised mortality ratios.Correlations between the indicators and mortality were all negative and stronger for men than for women.The composite indicator and percentage unemployed correlated most strongly with mortality.There was a moderate correlation between the remaining indicators and mortality for men, but only a weak correlation for women.The results suggest that the use of simple area indicators may be inadequate to classify the social class of women, and that the unemployment rate in those over 35 years of age may be a reasonable alternative to the composite indicator for the purpose of social class adjustment in mortality studies.
Increased lipoprotein(a) concentrations in chronic renal failure.Subjects with chronic renal failure have a greatly increased risk of coronary heart disease and dyslipidemia.Relatively few studies have examined the relationship of chronic renal failure to lipoprotein (Lp)(a) concentrations, an important risk factor for coronary heart disease.Diabetic subjects have been reported to have both increased Lp(a) concentrations and an increased risk of renal failure, thereby possibly confounding the Lp(a)-renal failure association.The association between Lp(a) and chronic renal failure in 359 control subjects and 111 subjects with renal failure was examined.Lp(a) (in milligrams per deciliter) was elevated in subjects with chronic renal failure, regardless of ethnicity (Mexican Americans, 19.8 +/- 2.7 versus 14.1 +/- 1.3;P = 0.03;non-Hispanic white patients, 24.9 +/- 3.0 versus 16.3 +/- 1.2;P = 0.006;).These differences persisted after adjustment for diabetes and ethnicity (P < 0.001).The type of treatment for chronic renal failure (diet, hemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis) did not have an effect on Lp(a) concentrations.Lp(a) levels were not correlated with the level of creatinine in subjects with chronic renal failure.Thus, the elevation of Lp(a) levels in renal failure must occur early in renal failure, or alternatively, elevated Lp(a) levels may promote progression to chronic renal failure.These results indicate that Lp(a) concentrations are increased in chronic renal failure and may increase the risk for coronary heart disease in these subjects.
An interactive, educational model for insulin dosage and dietary adjustment in type I diabetes mellitus.Joe Daniels is a 41 year old, 76kg male, insulin-treated diabetic patient who was diagnosed as being diabetic in 1972, at the age of 22.Joe recently found that he was having hypoglycaemic symptoms.Using self-monitoring blood glucose equipment glycaemic levels below 3.0 mmol/l were recorded at least once a week while hyperglycaemic readings (> 16 mmol/l) were observed 2-3 times per week.Joe came into hospital to have his glycaemic control improved as doctors were concerned about the risks of him suffering a serious hypoglycaemic attack.Using some of the data collected by Joe while in hospital we will demonstrate how a computer model of glucose-insulin interaction in type I diabetes can be used interactively to teach diabetic patients about their diabetes and educate them to adjust their own insulin injections and diet.
Post-traumatic stress disorders and European war veterans.After tracing the history of PTSD as a diagnosis and exemplifying its use among non-European war veteran groups, this review article documents the size and characteristics of European war veteran populations and the known psychological, social and medical sequelae of war experience since 1918.Models of psychopathology vary markedly over time and between countries.Treatment practices owe more to sociopolitical and military expediency than systematic assessment of European veterans' needs and treatment outcomes.PTSD has not yet attained the pivotal status it enjoys in studies of American war veterans.Reasons for this are offered along with a proposal that recent European studies rightly highlight a broad spectrum of post-war adjustment difficulties in which PTSD emerges as a process phenomenon with implications for prognosis and future care planning.
Pharmacokinetics of famotidine in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.The pharmacokinetics of famotidine has been investigated in ascitic cirrhotic patients.10 decompensated cirrhotic patients were studied (9m, 1f), who had normal renal function, and six healthy control subjects (4m, 2f), matched for age, sex and weight.Each subject received on two occasions, at least four days apart, a single oral (40 mg) or intravenous dose (20 mg) of famotidine, at 21.00 h in a randomised manner.Serial blood samples were collected and famotidine in plasma was determined by a HPLC/UV method.Plasma data were subjected to non compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis.There were no statistically significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between the two groups after either the intravenous or oral administration of famotidine.The findings suggest that the dose of famotidine may not require any adjustment in ascitic patients without renal failure.
Occupational risk factors for acute leukaemia: a case-control study.A case-control study has been performed for occupational risk factors of acute leukaemia, based on 185 cases more than 30 years old and 513 matched controls.There was a significant excess of polyvalent farming and electronic engineers among professions of cases, and, in addition of metal workers when considering the professions pursued for more than 5 years.The corresponding exposures were analysed through a detailed questionnaire, and assessed by an industrial hygienist after blinding the case-control status.The odds ratios (OR) were computed after adjustment on matching variables and prior chemo- or radiotherapy treatment, and after stratification for the level and total duration of exposure.There was no excess of professional exposure to ionizing radiation among cases.A significant relationship was observed between acute leukaemia and high or medium exposure to benzene, as well as over 10 years high or medium exposure to exhaust gas.In addition a significant relationship was observed with exposure to pesticides--insecticides and/or weed killers--and to electric and magnetic fields (EMF).The relationship with pesticides was significant when considering high or medium exposure to weed killers and more than 10 years exposure to both subtypes of pesticides.The relationship with pesticides and EMF remained significant when confounding factors were taken into consideration and after adjustment on co-exposure to benzene.The cytological studies showed that acute leukaemias following exposure to benzene (high or medium) and to EMF were only of myelogenous subtypes, whereas those following exposure to pesticides were divided between lymphoblastic and myeloblastic subtypes.Cytogenetic studies failed to show increased frequency of chromosomal abnormalities, as described in acute leukaemias secondary to anti-cancer treatments.Our study adds credence to the hypothesis that pesticides and EMF are leukaemogenic agents, together with benzene.
Maternal smoking during pregnancy and delinquency of the offspring: an association without causation?The aim was to evaluate the association between maternal smoking in pregnancy and delinquency of the offspring in youth and early adulthood.The study population consisted of 5966 male members of the Northern Finland birth cohort of 1966, of whom 355 (6.0%) had committed a crime which led to a criminal record by early 1989, which was taken as an indicator of delinquency.Data collection was started during pregnancy and the development and health of the children was followed up continuously to the age of 14.The incidence of delinquency by the age of 22 was 4.6% among the sons of the mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy and 10.3% among those of the smokers.No clear dose-response gradient was observed, and those stopping smoking during the first trimester of the pregnancy had only a slightly smaller incidence of delinquency than those continuing smoking through pregnancy.The association of maternal smoking with delinquency was studied by controlling a number of social and demographic variables using an approach based on stratification by a confounder score.The adjusted incidence difference between smoking and non-smoking mothers was 4.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] : 2.5-5.8) and the ratio was 1.73 (95% CI : 1.41-2.12).A parallel analysis by logistic regression yielded an estimated odds ratio of 1.74 (95% CI : 1.37-2.11) for the same comparison.Even though the association between maternal smoking and delinquency of the offspring remained after adjustment for the available social and demographic factors, maternal smoking may be symptomatic of a certain lifestyle and norm-breaking behaviour which is likely to increase delinquency in the children rather than being an agent with a direct causal role.This is supported by the lack of any clear dose-response pattern and the minor importance of stopping smoking.Another possibility is that maternal smoking may cause some kind of brain damage which affects the behaviour of the child.
Children with physical handicaps and their mothers: the interrelation of social support, maternal adjustment, and child adjustment.Examined the interrelation of maternal adjustment, mother-child interaction, and child adjustment in 29 families of children with spina bifida and without mental retardation and in 28 families of children without handicaps.A multivariate, ecological model proposed that adjustment of mother and child depends on the adaptiveness of maternal response to the stress of the physical handicap and on the ability of mothers to create an optimal caregiving environment through mother-child interaction.Analyses examining the relationships among maternal social support, maternal psychological adjustment, and child adjustment are reported.Social support was found to be related to higher maternal psychological adjustment and to higher child adjustment, and maternal psychological adjustment was related positively to child adjustment in both groups.No significant differences were found between groups in the examined relationships or in the levels of resources and adjustment.Results underscore strengths of families of children with spina bifida in their adaptation to the stress of the handicap.
Psychological adjustment of children with cystic fibrosis: the role of child cognitive processes and maternal adjustment.Found 60% of children 7-12 years old with cystic fibrosis to have a parent-reported behavior problem and 62% met the criteria for a DSM-III diagnosis based on a structured clinical interview with the child.Mixed internal and external behavior problem patterns and diagnoses of anxiety and oppositional disorder were most frequent.Support was provided for the hypothesized psycho-social/mediational roles of child perception of self-worth and maternal anxiety in child adjustment.Together, the variables of the transactional stress and coping model accounted for 39 and 43% of the variance in mother-reported internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and for 68% of the variance in child-reported problems.
Peer influences in pediatric chronic illness: an update.Examined research on peer relations of children with chronic illness.In general, scant attention has been devoted to this topic.A recent review (La Greca, 1990) highlighted this oversight and suggested several avenues for further research and clinical endeavors.This paper updates the earlier review, and provides examples from current literature regarding the role of peer relations in adjustment to chronic disease.Data are presented from an ongoing investigation of the ways in which friends and family members provide support for adolescents with diabetes.Adolescents' friends were more oriented toward companionship support than were family members;both family and friends were reported to provide emotional support for diabetes care, although the types of emotional support varied.Findings are discussed in the context of the important and varied role that peers play in youngsters' disease adaptation.
Birthweight-adjusted mortality rates for assessing the effectiveness of neonatal intensive care.Mortality rates for very-low-birthweight infants vary significantly among different neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Computational models and computer simulation are used to predict the performance of an algorithm for identifying individual NICUs within a network that have greater than 110% of the expected birthweight-adjusted mortality risk.The algorithm maintains high sensitivity and specificity with as few as three moderately heterogeneous risk categories when applied to large health care networks;the model parameters were based on preliminary data from a real NICU network.The performance of the algorithm depends on the number of admissions at the individual NICU.A NICU with a center-specific risk 130% of the network average would be correctly identified as an outlier 50% of the time if it had 35 admissions, 59% of the time if it had 70 admissions, and 77% of the time if it had 280 admissions.A NICU with average risk would be incorrectly identified as an outlier 16%, 12%, or 2% of the time if it had 35, 70, or 280 admissions, respectively.Severity-of-illness casemix adjustment did not improve these results.It is concluded that the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm in determining which facilities have higher-than-expected mortality will be less in typical NICU networks than in large health care networks that treat adult patients.It is unlikely that severity-of-illness adjustments will overcome the problem of the small numbers of admissions at individual NICUs.
Opposing changes in past and future time orientations with age.The bidirectional model of psychological time, that past and future orientations change in opposite directions with increasing age, was tested.Age was positively related to the number of life experiences recalled by 67 college students from the distant past but was negatively correlated with life experiences expected to occur in the near or distant future.This simultaneous and inverse adjustment of past and future orientations with age adds further support to a bidirectional model consistent with field theory.
Postural fall in blood pressure in the elderly in relation to drug treatment and other lifestyle factors.In a study of 843 independent-living men and women aged between 60 and 87 in Perth, Western Australia, stepwise multiple regression, after correction for initial levels of systolic blood pressure, showed that postural fall in systolic blood pressure was positively related to alcohol intake of more than 20 ml/day, the use of sleeping tablets and higher levels of anxiety on the Spielberger state-trait scale, and negatively related to body mass index.Postural fall in blood pressure was not significantly related to treatment for hypertension, age, sex, patterns of usual physical activity, tea or coffee drinking, or the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.This analysis is the first to examine the relationship between lifestyle factors and the magnitude of the fall in systolic blood pressure on standing after adjustment for the association between the change in a variable and its initial level.Our analysis suggests the need for further study of the possible role of lifestyle factors such as the use of sleeping tablets and alcohol in postural hypotension in the elderly.
The concept of residual confounding in regression models and some applications.In this paper the concept of residual confounding is generalized to various types of regression models such as logistic regression or Cox regression.Residual confounding and a newly suggested parameter, the relative residual confounding, are defined on the regression parameters of the models.The estimator gives the proportion of confounding which has been removed by incomplete adjustment.The concept quantifies the effects of categorizing continuous covariables and of model misspecification.These are investigated by a simulation study and with data from an epidemiological investigation.A case-control study of laryngeal cancer is used to illustrate the residual confounding effect of arbitrary transformation of a continuous confounder, smoking, on the effect of alcohol consumption on laryngeal cancer risk.The data also showed that categorization into two levels can yield high residual confounding.The parameters described in this paper are of some use in quantifying the effect of inadequate adjustment for confounding variables.
[Intratumoral biological markers in breast cancers]Tumoral biological markers of breast cancer expand the predictive value of conventional prognostic factors, such as tumor size, axillary lymph node status, and histoprognostic grade.They include tumor estrogen and progesterone receptor levels, flow cytometric DNA analysis, to convey a prognostic value.Expression of the product of the gene pS2, which reflects the functional integrity of the estradiol receptor, indicates a good prognosis.In contrast, presence of growth factor receptors, such as the EGF receptor, or amplification of the HER2/neu or INT2 oncogene indicate a poor prognosis.Study of protein gp 170 and GST-pi predicts the response of tumors to chemotherapy, while the study of the potential doubling time (Tpot) provides an indication of the renewal capacity of the tumor.Markers of tumor invasiveness and metastatic potential include proteases (activators and inhibitors) produced either by tumor cells or by the cells of the stroma, gene nm 23, and membrane fatty acids.The place of the last markers in patients' treatment is not known yet.The knowledge of the tumor biological parameters along with clinical features should provide an accurate prediction of the aggressiveness of the tumor, allowing the best adjustment of treatment with the expected behavior of the disease.
[Prevention of venous thromboembolism in internal medicine patients]In the entirety of medical patients, mechanical prophylactic measures and subcutaneous application of heparin have a documented efficiency and few side effects.With them the hospital mortality can be lowered by about 30%.When analysing the risks for patients of internal medicine, immobilisation respectively absence of the muscle pump play a central role in the list of risk factors.Possibilities for improving prophylaxis comprise an individual adjustment of heparin dosing (the improved efficiency in comparison with fixed dosing is not yet proven, but probable on the basis of experience made with surgical patients), the combination with mechanical/physical measures and the more consistent realisation in patients at risk.For achieving this the dosing only once per day with low molecular heparin is favourable, the latter being at least equally efficient.
Parental and family predictors of behavior problems in inner-city black children.Studied contributions of maternal psychological distress, family stress load, maternal and family risk factors, and family coping strategies in predicting behavior problems in 441 inner-city black primary-grade children.Results indicated maternal psychological distress and high family stress load were associated with high child behavior problems.Family coping strategies offered no protection against risk, while coping with life difficulties by reframing them was detrimental to child behavioral adjustment.Active help-seeking strategies (i.e., family mobilization, acquiring social supports) served to moderate the effects of maternal psychological distress and family risk attributes for boys, but exacerbated the effects of dysfunctional maternal social and psychiatric histories for girls.Implications for understanding vulnerability and resilience in inner-city black children and recommendations for future research are discussed.
Prediction of early social and academic adjustment of children from the inner city.Investigated predictors of five measures of early school adjustment for an ethnically diverse cohort of 683 inner-city kindergartners and first graders.Data from 2 consecutive years were collected from teachers, school records, and children.A multiple-regression preduction model significantly explained children's competence behavior, problem behavior, reading achievement, mathematics achievement, and school absences.Prior adjustment and sociodemographic factors explained a majority of the variance in adjustment.Perceived quality of parent involvement was signifcantly related (in the expected direction) to all five outcomes.Exposure to life events was significantly associated in the expected direction with competence behavior, problem behavior, and school absences but not with reading and mathematics achievement.Together, parent involvement and life-event variables explained as much as 12% of the variance in adjustment independent of sociodemographic and prior adjustment factors.The role of family and school factors in the adjustment of children at risk is discussed [corrected].
A simple eye-lens shielding technique compatible with independent jaws of a linear accelerator.A technique, compatible with accelerators having independent collimators, is presented, which greatly simplifies alignment of pencil eye-lens shields.The patient is placed so that the eye to be shielded is on the central axis of the beam and the accelerator's collimators are adjusted independently to define the field.A divergent lead shield 14 cm long is suspended from a wire that hangs along the central axis from a blocking tray in its usual location.The suspension length is variable and adjusted on the first day so that the shield is about 1 cm above the patient's eye.On subsequent treatment days, the wire is simply put in place on the tray with no further adjustment required.This technique reduces setup time and makes the shield positioning highly reproducible.
Serum immunoreactive erythropoietin in patients with idiopathic aplastic and Fanconi's anaemias.In patients with idiopathic aplastic anaemia (n = 34) and Fanconi's anaemia (n = 8), sampled once or on several occasions, serum erythropoietin (Epo) increased with increasing severity of anaemia with apparently similar rates of increase in each group.However, after adjustment for Hb, log Epo values for the Fanconi's anaemics tended to be greater than those for the idiopathic aplastic anaemics (P < 0.01).Erythropoietin concentrations in serum samples from patients with Fanconi's and idiopathic aplastic anaemias tended to be greater than in samples from patients with anaemias from protein energy malnutrition, myelodysplasia and iron deficiency.The results suggest that there is no deficiency of erythropoietin in Fanconi's and idiopathic aplastic anaemias and that if exogenous erythropoietin is of any benefit it would need to be administered in doses large enough to induce a significant increase in log Epo.Results of the study illustrate the need to take account of the assumptions which underlie interpretation of the statistical analysis.Use of erythropoietin values in place of log Epo gives misleading conclusions demonstrable as invalid as the conditions for normality of distribution of the data and homogeneity of variances were not satisfied.
Dietary L-lysine and calcium metabolism in humans.Calcium deficiency contributes to age-related bone loss;consequently, any preventive approach to osteoporosis should include dietary Ca adjustment or supplementation.The ideal Ca supplement would yield the greatest bioavailability.Studies in animals have shown that dietary supplements with certain amino acids, particularly L-lysine, can increase Ca absorption.Therefore, we examined the potential effect of this essential amino acid on Ca metabolism in humans.In one study, the acute effects of an oral Ca load (3 g as CaCl2) administered with or without 400 mg of L-lysine were compared in 15 healthy and 15 osteoporotic women.In all cases, the oral Ca load determined a progressive increase in serum total Ca and Ca2+ and a concomitant decrease in neophrogenous cAMP.As expected, a progressive increase in urinary Ca excretion was also observed, except in the L-lysine-treated healthy subjects, who exhibited a blunted calciuric response to the Ca load.In a second study, the effects of a short-term dietary supplementation with either L-lysine, L-valine, or L-tryptophan (800 mg/day) on 47Ca fraction absorption were compared in 45 osteoporotic patients.L-Lysine but not L-valine or L-tryptophan significantly increased the intestinal absorption of the mineral.Our results suggest that L-lysine can both enhance intestinal Ca absorption and improve the renal conservation of the absorbed Ca.The combined effects may contribute to a positive Ca balance, thus suggesting a potential usefulness of L-lysine supplements for both preventive and therapeutic interventions in osteoporosis.
Conditioning regimens for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.Conditioning regimens for transplantation are important in determining transplant outcome.This review focuses on transplantation in aplastic anemia and leukemia using marrow from HLA-identical siblings.Results of conditioning with newer regimens such as busulfan plus cyclophosphamide and etoposide plus total body irradiation are reviewed and compared to results achieved with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation.The potential for improved results using recent innovations such as dose adjustment of busulfan, agents which may decrease transplant-related toxicity, and directed radiation are discussed.
Serum antioxidant vitamins and risk of cataract.OBJECTIVE--To investigate serum concentrations of alpha tocopherol, beta carotene, retinol, and selenium for their prediction of end stage cataract.DESIGN--A case-control study, nested within a cohort study, based on the linkage of records of subjects aged 40-83 from a health survey with those from the national Finnish hospital discharge register.SUBJECTS--47 patients admitted to ophthalmological wards for senile cataract over 15 years and two controls per patient individually matched for sex, age, and municipality.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Concentration of serum micronutrients, development of cataract according to whether operation was performed.RESULTS--Low serum concentrations of antioxidant vitamins predicted the development of senile cataract, the odds ratio between the lowest third and the two higher thirds of the distribution of serum concentrations of alpha tocopherol and beta carotene being 1.9 (95% confidence interval 0.9 to 4.1) and 1.7 (0.8 to 3.8), respectively.Patients with both alpha tocopherol and beta carotene concentrations in the lowest third had an odds ratio of 2.6 (1.0 to 6.8) of cataract compared with subjects in the top two thirds.The associations were strengthened by adjustment for potential confounding factors such as occupation, smoking, blood pressure, serum cholesterol concentration, body mass index, and diabetes.No association was found between the serum concentrations of selenium, retinol, and retinol binding protein and the risk of cataract.CONCLUSIONS--Low serum concentrations of the antioxidant vitamins alpha tocopherol and beta carotene are risk factors for end stage senile cataract.Controlled trials of the role of antioxidant vitamins in cataract prevention are therefore warranted.
[Overview of the clinical use of the specular reflex in intraocular lenses]On both surfaces of the intraocular lens, due to its physical properties, an intense and homogenous reflex develops suitable for retrograde illumination of the cornea, anterior chamber, the remainder of the lenticular capsule, for examination of amorphous, cellular and fibrinous membranes on the surface of the intraocular lens and visualization of defects of the intraocular lens.Based on experience from specular routine microscopic examinations the author considers that visualization of defects of the Descemet's membrane is most useful as well as of precipitates on the endothelium in opaque structures of the cornea, evaluation of the immunological reaction on the surface of the intraocular lens as a picture of the dynamics of the reaction and biocompatibility of the material of the intraocular lens, detection of defects which occur during manufacture and manipulation in the operation theatre in vivo and defects during YAG-laser therapy with possible subsequent adjustment of the intensity and focusing.
Body composition and bone mass in post-menopausal women.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess total body composition and to study the interrelationships between fat and lean tissue mass with total and regional bone mass in healthy British post-menopausal women.DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Total body composition and regional bone mass were measured in 97 healthy post-menopausal women recruited from the general community.The mean age was 57.9 years, range 49-65.MEASUREMENTS: Total body composition (fat, lean tissue and bone mineral) and regional bone density in the lumbar spine and femur were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry on a Lunar DPX.RESULTS: Significant negative correlations with age were found for total body bone mineral density (r = -0.200, P = 0.049), and lumbar spine bone mineral density (r = -0.28, P = 0.006);the calculated rate of bone loss from these two sites was 0.33 and 0.7% per annum respectively.Fat tissue mass showed a positive correlation with age (r = 0.22, P = 0.03).High correlations were observed between total body and regional bone mineral density (r = 0.755-0.829, P < 0.001).After adjustment for age and lean mass, statistically significant correlations were seen between fat tissue mass and all bone mass measurements (P < 0.01-0.001), the strongest correlations being found for total body bone mineral content and density (r = 0.477 and 0.488 respectively).Lean tissue mass showed a strong correlation with total body bone mineral content (r = 0.580, P < 0.001), after adjustment for age and fat mass;it was less strongly correlated with other bone mass measurements than fat mass, showing only weak correlations with total body, trochanteric and lumbar spine bone mineral density (r = 0.228-0.246, P < 0.05).Age-adjusted body weight showed stronger correlations with total and regional bone mass than did either body mass index or height.CONCLUSIONS: Both fat and lean tissue mass are related to total and regional bone mass in post-menopausal women, the relationship being strongest for fat mass.Body weight shows stronger correlations with bone mass than either height or body mass index.In view of the direction and magnitude of changes in fat, lean tissue and bone mineral after the menopause, adiposity and muscularity are more likely to be determinants of peak bone mass than of the rate of post-menopausal bone loss.
Determinants of serum zinc in a random population sample of four Belgian towns with different degrees of environmental exposure to cadmium.This report investigated the distribution of serum zinc and the factors determining serum zinc concentration in a large random population sample.The 1977 participants (959 men and 1018 women), 20-80 years old, constituted a stratified random sample of the population of four Belgian districts, representing two areas with low and two with high environmental exposure to cadmium.For each exposure level, a rural and an urban area were selected.The serum concentration of zinc, frequently used as an index for zinc status in human subjects, was higher in men (13.1 mumole/L, range 6.5-23.0 mumole/L) than in women (12.6 mumole/L, range 6.3-23.2 mumole/L).In men, 20% of the variance of serum zinc was explained by age (linear and squared term, R = 0.29), diurnal variation (r = 0.29), and total cholesterol (r = 0.16).After adjustment for these covariates, a negative relationship was observed between serum zinc and both blood (r = -0.10) and urinary cadmium (r = -0.14).In women, 11% of the variance could be explained by age (linear and squared term, R = 0.15), diurnal variation in serum zinc (r = 0.27), creatinine clearance (r = -0.11), log gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (r = 0.08), cholesterol (r = 0.07), contraceptive pill intake (r = -0.07), and log serum ferritin (r = 0.06).Before and after adjustment for significant covariates, serum zinc was, on average, lowest in the two districts where the body burden of cadmium, as assessed by urinary cadmium excretion, was highest.These results were not altered when subjects exposed to heavy metals at work were excluded from analysis.

Neurotoxicity of solvent mixtures in spray painters.II.Neurologic, psychiatric, psychological, and neuroradiologic findings.A multidisciplinary cross-sectional study was performed to examine the chronic neurotoxicity of organic solvents.Participating in the study were 105 persons employed as spray painters and having long-term solvent exposure (10-44 years) and a control group consisting of 58 construction workers, electricians, and plumbers without occupational contact to solvents.Samples were matched for age, preexposure intelligence level, occupation, and socioeconomic status.After controlling for potentially non occupational confounding factors (neuropsychiatric diseases, metabolic disorders, high blood pressure, alcohol intake) 83 spray painters and 42 controls were entered finally into the study.The evaluation included work history, self-rating questionnaire, neurologic investigation, psychiatric analysis using the Present State Examination (PSE), psychological testing, and computerized axial tomography (CAT) of the brain.Physical and neurologic examinations demonstrated no case of overt disorders of the central or peripheral nervous system.An important result of the psychiatric analysis was that the syndromes Further analyses demonstrated an association with chronic exposure over 30 years and repeated acute neurotoxic effects during solvent exposures.Neither psychological nor performance tests demonstrated any statistically significant differences in the performance sets after adjustment according to premorbid intelligence level;this finding supports the presumption of only a low grade of mental dysfunction.Correlation analyses indicated a relationship between subjective health complaints and long-term solvent exposure;however, the effect of age cannot be completely ruled out.
Influence of calf muscle contractions on blood flow parameters measured in the arteria femoralis.Ten healthy male subjects performed single (< 1 s), sustained and intermittent plantarflexions (up to 40 s) of one foot in sitting exercise position.Two different absolute forces were applied, which, in terms of maximal voluntary contraction, ranged between 5%-10% and 25%-30%.Blood velocity was continuously recorded in the proximal arteria femoralis by means of the Doppler technique.Heart rate (HR) and mean blood pressure (BP) were simultaneously determined using standard ECG and the FINAPRES method.Despite the distance between the proximal arteria femoralis and the exercising muscle the Doppler data showed: effects of single contractions on the individual Doppler data, the influence of consecutive contractions, variation with exercise intensity and differences between sustained and intermittent contractions.In all exercise tests there was an immediate significant increase in blood velocity at the onset of exercise.The major part (range 52%-73%) of the response to the 40 s tests was seen during the first 6 s.It was followed by a second phase of adjustment which depended on the type of exercise and exercise intensity.The single plantarflexion provoked increases in blood velocity for about 20 s.A comparison of HR and BP tracings with the Doppler data demonstrated the importance of local mechanical factors for the perfusion of the exercising muscle.The early adjustment of muscle perfusion were not correlated to the systemic blood pressure and, therefore, appeared to be related to muscle pump effects.The subsequent flow values were influenced by passive vessel compression and changes in local vasomotor tone.
Diagnosis and treatment of insomnia and risks associated with lack of treatment.Despite the fact that the prevalence rate for insomnia in the United States is high (35.2%), the number of patients with this condition do not represent a large percentage of patients evaluated and treated in sleep disorders clinics.On the other hand, the great majority of patients with insomnia do not seek treatment for their condition from their physicians.Several hypotheses have been created to explain this phenomenon: (1) lack of training for physicians in the area of sleep disorders, (2) pessimism in relation to treatment outcome shared by patients and physicians, and (3) time constraints and other reasons on the part of the physicians.Insomniacs, however, deserve accurate diagnosis and effective treatments for their condition.Insomnia is often the result of multiple factors converging rather than one single cause.For academic purposes, however, different disorders in difficulties with initiation and maintenance of sleep are discussed.Among them, adjustment sleep disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movements in sleep, circadian abnormalities, and psychiatric disturbances.Emphasis is placed on the treatment of each, along with the treatment of the other factors that are commonly found in patients with insomnia: poor sleep hygiene, use of medications that disrupt sleep, performance anxiety, deficient exposure to entrainers of circadian rhythms, diet, and exercise.A comprehensive treatment that includes a multifactorial approach is the ideal way to treat patients with insomnia.Research that will enhance our knowledge of the biological substrate of insomnia will provide clinicians with additional tools to improve the outcome of their treatments of patients with insomnia.
Negative cognitive errors and positive illusions for negative divorce events: predictors of children's psychological adjustment.This study examined the relations among negative cognitive errors regarding hypothetical negative divorce events, positive illusions about those same events, actual divorce events, and psychological adjustment in 38 8- to 12-year-old children whose parents had divorced within the previous 2 years.Children's scores on a scale of negative cognitive errors (catastrophizing, overgeneralizing, and personalizing) correlated significantly with self-reported symptoms of anxiety and self-esteem, and with maternal reports of behavior problems.Children's scores on a scale measuring positive illusions (high self-regard, illusion of personal control, and optimism for the future) correlated significantly with less self-reported aggression.Both appraisal types accounted for variance in some measures of symptomatology beyond that explained by actual events.There was no significant association between children's negative cognitive errors and positive illusions.The implications of these results for theories of negative cognitive errors and of positive illusions, as well as for future research, are discussed.
Separation-individuation, family functioning, and psychological adjustment in college students: a construct validity study of the Separation-Individuation Test of Adolescence.We evaluated the construct validity of the Separation-Individuation Test of Adolescence (SITA;Levine, Green, & Millon, 1986).Based on a review of the theoretical literature on separation-individuation issues during late adolescence, predictions were made as to how SITA scores would correlate with aspects of family functioning and psychological adjustment.The SITA and a battery of self-report family and adjustment measures were administered to 454 college students (272 females and 182 males;74% White, 16% African American, and 10% Asian American or Hispanic).Correlational analyses offered partial support for the construct validity of the SITA.Cluster analyses revealed four distinct groups of subjects (anxious deniers, healthy separators, peaceful detachers, and succorance seekers), each with its own coherent set of scores on the SITA and instruments measuring family relations and positive and negative psychological adjustment.Criticisms concerning the labels and composition of the SITA scales are also discussed.
Personality inventory responses of males with medically intractable seizures.The psychosocial adjustment of 50 male patients to intractable seizures was assessed by comparing their responses to a combined version of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) to the responses of 50 medical, psychiatric, or nonclinical controls who denied seizures.The two groups were significantly different (p < .01) on one MMPI and 10 CPI scales.Significant (p < .01) between-group differences were also reflected in 29 of the 704 personality inventory items.Those items were rationally clustered according to content into six conceptually identifiable subscales;30 additional items with similar content that were significant at the .05 level were added to those subscales.Comparison of subscale scores of an additional 30 seizure and 30 nonseizure subjects using analysis of variance revealed F values that reached statistical significance (p < .05) in four cases and approached significance (p = .07) in another.Applying coefficients derived from discriminant analysis of the first samples correctly classified 99% of the original patients and 85% of the validation subjects.Results reveal a logical, understandable, and largely adaptive response to intractable seizures and offer little support for the concept of a dysfunctional or pathological interictal personality style.
Behavioral adjustment and self-concept of young children with hemangiomas.This study was conducted to determine the behavioral responses and self-concepts of young children with self-limited but transiently disfiguring capillary hemangiomas involving the head and neck.Nineteen children with hemangiomas, age 3 to 5 years, and their parents were compared with an age-matched control group without lesions.Responses to a parental checklist, informal interview, and self-concept test showed few differences between young children with hemangiomas and those without this neoplasm.
Compliance.Compliance is an ancient topic subjected to intense recent scrutiny as a result of scientific and social changes which focus on lifestyle adjustment to chronic illness and emphasize increasing patient involvement in self-care.Difficulties in definition, measurement and research design as well as the complexity of the problems contribute to conflicting findings and a lack of consensus about determinants of compliance.Five conceptual models have been studied but only a few positive and negative factors have been consistently identified, perhaps because outcome is often influenced by subtle attitudes, beliefs and quality of life considerations.Management involves both education and a variety of interventions that range from simple single strategies to complex multimodal approaches in which the patient's role may vary from being a passive participant of professional supervision to complete autonomy and self-care.
Youth suicides unknown to psychiatric care providers.Less than 50% of young suicides have consulted psychiatric care providers.Thus the population not found within the psychiatric care sector is described in this paper.Fifty-eight consecutive suicides among adolescents and young adults, studied by psychological autopsies, were classified according to presence or absence of previous psychiatric care.Fifteen of the sixteen subjects without previous care were males, six of these were diagnosed as having an adjustment disorder related to a recent event.Unemployment was less common (p < 0.01), the suicidal processes were shorter (p < 0.001), and previous parasuicide was less frequent (p < 0.001) among nonpatients.Evaluation in accordance with DSM-III-R criteria showed fewer substance abuse disorders (p < 0.01).Open suicidal communication prior to the suicide was less frequent but active methods were used by this population as often as by subjects known to care providers.
Markers of health status in an HTLV-I-positive cohort.The health effects of chronic human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) infection were examined in a cohort of Japanese men who had emigrated from Okinawa, Japan, and had been participants in a prospective study in Hawaii since 1965.In the present follow-up study carried out in 1987-1988, various health indicators were measured in the subjects, whose mean age was 72.5 years.Participation rates were lower in the HTLV-I seropositives than in the seronegatives (46.7% vs.76.0%) in the > or = 75-year age group.Lack of participation was significantly correlated with a high HTLV-I antibody titer.Among the participants, seropositive subjects were significantly more likely than the seronegatives to have lymphocytopenia (32.7% vs.17.7%) and mild anemia (25.5% vs.14.1%) after adjustment for age and socioeconomic status.The seropositives also had a higher frequency of acupuncture therapy (age-adjusted odds ratios were 2.1 and 4.2 for 1-5 treatments and > or = 6 treatments, respectively).Proportions of subjects who had been hospitalized at least twice were higher among the seropositives in the oldest age groups, 70-74 years and > or = 75 years, but not in those aged 65-69 years.Although specific disease conditions were not identified in this study, hematologic data, treatment histories, and the correlation between participation status and HTLV-I antibody titers suggest that chronic HTLV-I infection may be associated with as yet undefined adverse health effects, particularly in older age groups.
Long-term suppression of secondary hyperparathyroidism by intravenous 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 in patients on chronic hemodialysis.The effect of intravenous 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 [1 alpha(OH)D3] on circulating levels of intact parathyroid hormone (PTH 1-84) and COOH-terminal immunoreactive PTH(PTH 53-84) was examined in 13 patients on chronic hemodialysis.Thirteen patients were treated for 300 days (10 months), 9 patients for 520 days (14 months) and 6 patients for 720 days (2 years) with increasing doses of 1 alpha(OH)D3 intravenously under careful control of plasma Ca2+.Blood samples were obtained 1 week before start of treatment and then at every 2nd week.None of the patients had previously been treated with oral vitamin D metabolites.Intact PTH levels were maximally suppressed after 27-33 weeks of treatment by approximately 73%.At the end of the study periods, PTH 1-84 was still suppressed by 78 +/- 4.3% after 300 days, 78 +/- 8.8% after 520 days and 85 +/- 6.5% after 720 days.Plasma Ca2+ was kept within normal levels, but showed an initial increase from 1.14 +/- 0.03 to 1.27 +/- 0.15 mmol/l, and an adjustment of the doses of 1 alpha(OH)D3 was necessary.The present investigation demonstrated (1) that intravenous administration of the 1-hydroxylated vitamin D metabolite 1 alpha(OH)D3 induced a significant decrease in circulating levels of biologically active intact PTH, and (2) that it was possible to maintain the marked suppression of PTH secretion by intravenous treatment of 1 alpha (OH)D3 for up to 2 years.Hypercalcemia could be avoided by careful monitoring of plasma Ca2+ and adjustment of the doses of 1 alpha(OH)D3.
Perception of airway obstruction in a random population sample.Relationship to airway hyperresponsiveness in the absence of respiratory symptoms.Subjects with asymptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness in epidemiologic studies may have variable airway obstruction that is not perceived as dyspnea.We tested the hypothesis that such subjects are less likely to report an increase in dyspnea during histamine-induced bronchoconstriction than symptomatic hyperresponders.A random population sample of 412 middle-aged subjects was studied.Before and after a standardized histamine challenge test, subjects recorded Borg scores for dyspnea: any increase in Borg score was considered significant.More than 80% of hyperresponsive subjects (PC10 histamine < or = 16 mg/ml) had no symptoms.The presence of prechallenge dyspnea was related to increased airways responsiveness and current smoking.An increase in Borg score was associated with younger age, more severe airway responsiveness, atopy, and female sex.The level of and increase in the Borg score were not significantly related to level and change in airway caliber (FEV1).In hyperresponsive subjects (PC10 < or = 16 mg/ml), subjects who reported dyspnea, wheeze, or asthma were more likely to show an increase in Borg score during histamine provocation than asymptomatic subjects (adjusted odds ratio 4.01, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 16.00, p = 0.049), after adjustment for age, sex, smoking habits, FEV1, and atopy.This suggests that asymptomatic hyperresponders may have variable airway obstruction that is not recognized as breathlessness.
Young-adult children of alcoholic parents: protective effects of positive family functioning.The occurrence of alcoholism is clustered within families, but the detrimental effect of a positive family history may vary with the degree of family impairment involved.In this study we assessed the effects of family history and family environment on alcohol misuse.From ongoing studies we recruited parents who had a child aged 18-30, 20 with a DSM-III-R alcohol dependence diagnosis, 20 without.The child then completed a multidimensional assessment.The young-adult participants included 20 men and 20 women (mean age = 24.8).Differences by family history were restricted to substance abuse behaviors.While a high level of alcohol problems occurred in both groups, those with an alcohol-dependent parent were more likely to be heavy drinkers and showed more symptoms of alcohol dependence.Overall psychological adjustment did not differ between the groups, however.Alcohol misuse measures did correlate moderately with symptoms of poor emotional health.The most important correlates of alcohol misuse measures in this study were exposure to parental alcoholism, abusive punishment, and psychological symptoms, with some separation of effects in the two subgroups.Psychological symptoms had a stronger relationship with misuse in subjects with social-drinking parents, while abuse was more associated in the group with an alcohol-dependent parent.These results confirm the importance of environmental interactions with familial risk.A biological vulnerability from an alcohol-dependent parent was not sufficient or necessary for the participants in this study to develop alcohol dependence as a young adult, although there was an increased risk.There appear to be strong protective effects of positive family relationships on the potential negative effects of a family history of alcoholism.
Pediatric limb amputation: aspects of coping and psychotherapeutic intervention.This paper addresses the assessment of and intervention with pediatric patients undergoing limb amputation.A multicomponent treatment package is advocated including the use of play and cognitive-behavioral strategies to enhance coping and adjustment to the loss of a limb.
Natural cohorts: family similarity in adult cognition.We now return to the sets of hypotheses formulated in the introductory section to explore how the findings reported above bear on these propositions.Our first hypothesis dealt with whether family similarity could be observed in adulthood and whether there were differing ability patterns in such similarity.Significant family similarities were observed for our total sample for all ability measures, except Perceptual Speed, and for the cognitive style measures.The magnitude of correlations for the ability measures are comparable for those found between young adults and their children (DeFries et al., 1976).Similar to the DeFries study, we also found differences in resemblance across subsets.For example, same gender pairs showed higher correlations on Verbal Meaning, Number, and Word Fluency but opposite-gender pairs on Spatial Orientation, Inductive Reasoning, and Motor-Cognitive Flexibility.Also, greater similarity was found between mother-offspring pairs than father-offspring pairs on Inductive Reasoning and Psychomotor Speed.Moreover, higher parent-offspring correlations were found for daughters than for sons, suggesting at least the possibility that females may experience greater shared environmental influences than males.Our first hypothesis also argued for the possible effect of early shared environment upon offspring performance on Verbal Meaning and Word Fluency.After age adjustment, these were indeed the abilities that showed the highest parent-offspring similarity.Our second hypothesis proposed that if shared environmental influences are relatively unimportant in adulthood, then similarity within parent-offspring pairs should remain reasonably constant in adulthood across time and age.Our examination of this issue with a longitudinal sample ranging over a 21-year period strongly supports this proposition for all of those variables that displayed significant parent-offspring correlations.Indeed, parent-offspring correlations measured at approximately the same age of parent and offspring and when those ages were 20 years apart had similar magnitudes.The third hypothesis asked whether family similarity would decrease with age because of the increasing amount of nonnormative, nonshared environment expected as adult life progresses.Counterintuitively, no such decrease in similarity could be observed.Indeed, for two variables there was evidence for increasing similarity as a function of offspring age.This finding makes good sense for our Perceptual Speed variable.Most of our younger offspring typically have not yet experienced age-related decline on this variable, whereas some of their parents have.Both older offspring and parents may have experienced sufficient decline so that once again their observed similarity is increased.
Lead exposure and the motor developmental status of urban six-year-old children in the Cincinnati Prospective Study.The relationship between asymptomatic lead exposure and subtle deficits in intellectual attainment has been relatively well established by modern studies.However, neuromotor performance has rarely been the focus of these investigations.It was postulated that motor developmental outcomes may be more sensitive indicators of lead's adverse effects on the central nervous system as they are probably less confounded with social factors than cognitive and academic outcomes.A comprehensive neuromotor assessment battery was administered to 245 six-year-old urban inner-city children enrolled in the Cincinnati Lead Study.These children have been followed since birth with quarterly assessments of blood lead concentrations, medical status, and neurobehavioral development.Prior to covariate adjustment, neonatal, but not prenatal blood lead levels were associated with poorer scores on assessments of bilateral coordination, upper-limb speed and dexterity, and a composite index of fine-motor coordination.Averaged postnatal blood lead levels were also associated with lower scores on the aforementioned subtests as well as a measure of visual-motor control.Following statistical adjustment for covariates, neonatal blood lead levels were associated with poorer performance on a measure of upper-limb speed and dexterity and the fine-motor composite.Postnatal blood lead levels remained significantly associated with poorer scores on measures of bilateral coordination, visual-motor control, upper-limb speed and dexterity, and the fine-motor composite.Low to moderate lead exposure is associated with moderate deficits in gross and especially fine-motor developmental status.Results of this study provide support for recent initiatives to reduce the exposure of children to sources of environmental lead.
Relation between plasma concentrations of didanosine and markers of antiviral efficacy in adults with AIDS or AIDS-related complex.The relation between the average steady-state plasma concentration (Cpss) of didanosine and selected measures of efficacy, such as CD4 cell count, p24 antigenemia, and weight gain, was evaluated in patients participating in a phase 1 safety and pharmacokinetics study.All patients were diagnosed as having AIDS or severe AIDS-related complex.These individuals first received intravenous didanosine for 2 weeks at doses of 0.8-33 mg/(kg.d) and then took the drug orally at twice the intravenous dose.Cpss values were calculated on the basis of apparent oral clearance after 4 weeks of oral administration and average daily dose over the first 12 weeks of the study.These data were available for 61 patients enrolled at three clinical sites.High values for Cpss were strongly correlated with an increase in CD4 count (P = .006), a decrease in serum levels of p24 antigen (P = .006), and weight gain (P = .0001) at week 12.Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the influence of Cpss on response (as judged by the three criteria just mentioned) after adjustment for other potential factors related to infection with human immunodeficiency virus.The baseline CD4 cell count and the status with regard to prior zidovudine therapy were related to the CD4 response.However, the odds that a response would include all three parameters were nearly twice as high when the Cpss value increased by twofold.
The effect of alcohol on the risk of lung cancer in Uruguay.A hospital-based case-control study of the association between alcohol drinking and lung cancer was carried out in Uruguay between January 1988 and December 1990.The sample included 327 men with lung cancer and 350 male controls.Personal interviews were conducted in the Institute of Oncology by trained personnel using a structured questionnaire.The results showed a significant positive association between beer intake and the risk of lung cancer.The odds ratio for beer drinkers in the highest quartile was 3.4 (95% confidence limits, 1.3-6.6) after adjustment for tobacco.The association between beer and lung cancer was consistent for all the cell types, analyzed separately.A moderate effect for total alcohol consumption was also observed, with a relative risk of 2.2 for those subjects in the highest quartile.
Estrogen replacement therapy and endometrial cancer risk: unresolved issues.The Endometrial Cancer Collaborative Group.OBJECTIVE: To clarify several unresolved issues regarding the relationship of estrogens to endometrial cancer risk.METHODS: We conducted a hospital-based case-control study involving 300 menopausal women newly diagnosed with epithelial endometrial cancer and 207 population controls matched to the cases for age, race, and residence.RESULTS: Estrogen use significantly increased endometrial cancer risk (adjusted relative risk [RR] 3.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-5.1).Although both short- and long-term use appeared to elevate the risk of early-stage tumors, an effect of estrogens on late-stage tumors was observed only for long-term use (RR 2.1, 95% CI 0.7-6.4).A small proportion of women reported having used progestogens simultaneously with estrogens, which was associated with a lower risk (RR 1.8) than use of estrogens alone (RR 3.4).Although the highest risks were for recent users of estrogens, persistent excess risks were seen even for those who had discontinued use of 5 or more years.There were no striking relationships according to the type of estrogen or regimen used, and associations with dose were inconsistent, although women who used low-dose preparations exclusively had the lowest risk.Estrogen injections or creams, used by only 5.9 and 5.1% of the subjects, respectively, were not significant risk factors after adjustment for estrogen pill use.Women who were thin or who smoked cigarettes appeared to be most adversely affected by estrogen use.Estrogen users failed to experience the protective effect normally associated with oral contraceptive use.CONCLUSION: The effect of estrogens on endometrial cancer risk appears to vary both by usage patterns and by patient characteristics.
Smoking and risk of Graves' disease.OBJECTIVE--To assess if smoking is associated with Graves' disease and, if so, to ascertain whether this association persists when controlling for confounding factors.DESIGN--Consecutive entry case-control study with two age- and sex-matched control subjects from two different populations per case patient.SETTING--University hospital.PATIENTS--Five groups were studied: (1) Graves' ophthalmopathy and Graves' hyperthyroidism (n = 100;divided in four subgroups according to the severity of the eye disease);(2) Graves' hyperthyroidism without clinical eye involvement (n = 100);(3) sporadic nontoxic goiter (n = 100);(4) autoimmune hypothyroidism (n = 75);and (5) toxic nodular goiter (n = 75).The study comprised 200 subjects from a hospital-based population, and 200 from a population-based group served as control subjects.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Smoking status was determined from a questionnaire at the time of onset of the disease to exclude any effect of the disease itself on smoking.RESULTS--Smoking greatly increased the risk for Graves' ophthalmopathy (odds ratio, 7.7;95% confidence interval, 4.3 to 13.7), but patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism alone were also more often smokers than control subjects (odds ratio, 1.9;95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.2).Smoking was not associated with the other thyroid diseases studied.Essentially similar results were obtained after adjustment for differences in education between case patients and control subjects.Among the patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy, smokers had more severe eye disease than nonsmokers, but no association was found between the number of cigarettes smoked per day or the duration of smoking and the severity of the ophthalmopathy.However, there was a significant increase in the odds ratios in patients with more severe eye disease.CONCLUSIONS--Smoking is associated with Graves' disease, and it especially increases the risk for the development of more severe ophthalmopathy.Thus, smoking appears to be one of the multiple factors inducing Graves' disease in genetically predisposed individuals.
A 1H-NMR method for determining temperature in cell culture perfusion systems.This report describes a noninvasive 1H-NMR method for measuring absolute temperatures (+/- 0.2 degrees C) in biological samples and, in particular, in cell culture perfusion systems, utilizing the linear temperature dependence of the water chemical shift relative to the temperature-independent shift of one of the components of the biological medium, e.g., pyruvate, acetate or lactate.The effects of flow on temperature can be monitored and appropriate adjustment of the temperature controller can be made.
Clinical rheumatology training of Australian medical students.A national survey of 1991 graduates.OBJECTIVE: To describe Australian medical graduates' knowledge, experiences and practical training in rheumatology and their attitudes towards rehabilitation and disability.DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of all interns at randomly selected hospitals in each State.PARTICIPANTS: 382 Australian interns at 12 hospitals surveyed in the first week of their 1991 internship.RESULTS: New interns demonstrated little experience with soft tissue rheumatism, with only 45% reporting they had examined a patient with bursitis and 22% one with epicondylitis.There was considerable dissatisfaction with the teaching of assessment of low back pain, regardless of the amount of formal rheumatology teaching the graduates had experienced, with only 22% rating it as good or excellent.There was little evidence that students are exposed to the social dimensions of chronic illness;only 32% of students reported that they had been shown how to assess a patient's psychological adjustment to illness.Only 22% felt competent at assessing disability and handicap and less than half of the graduates studied had ever attended a clinic where there was a physiotherapist.Graduates who had never been attached to either a rheumatology ward or an outpatients clinic (17%) were less likely to have examined a patient with gout (P < 0.001), osteoarthritis (P < 0.01), or chronic low back pain (P < 0.05), and were more likely to report dissatisfaction with training in rheumatology.CONCLUSION: This survey suggests that there are significant problems in the training of medical students in musculoskeletal disorders, particularly in relation to the assessment of disability and the appreciation of psychosocial factors.
Interstitial-lymphatic mechanisms in the control of extracellular fluid volume.While the study of the physiochemical composition and structure of the interstitium on a molecular level is a large and important field in itself, the present review centered mainly on the functional consequences for the control of extracellular fluid volume.As pointed out in section I, a biological monitoring system for the total extracellular volume seems very unlikely because a major part of that volume is made up of multiple, separate, and functionally heterogeneous interstitial compartments.Even less likely is a selective volume control of each of these compartments by the nervous system.Instead, as shown by many studies cited in this review, a local autoregulation of interstitial volume is provided by automatic adjustment of the transcapillary Starling forces and lymph flow.Local vascular control of capillary pressure and surface area, of special importance in orthostasis, has been discussed in several recent reviews and was mentioned only briefly in this article.The gel-like consistency of the interstitium is attributed to glycosaminoglycans, in soft connective tissues mainly hyaluronan.However, the concept of a gel phase and a free fluid phase now seems to be replaced by the quantitatively more well-defined distribution spaces for glycosaminoglycans and plasma protein, apparently in osmotic equilibrium with each other.The protein-excluded space, determined mainly by the content of glycosaminoglycans and collagen, has been measured in vivo in many tissues, and the effect of exclusion on the oncotic buffering has been clarified.The effect of protein charge on its excluded volume and on interstitial hydraulic conductivity has been studied only in lungs and is only partly clarified.Of unknown functional importance is also the recent finding of a free interstitial hyaluronan pool with relatively rapid removal by lymph.The postulated preferential channels from capillaries to lymphatics have received little direct support.Thus the variation of plasma-to-lymph passage times for proteins may probably be ascribed to heterogeneity with respect to path length, linear velocity, and distribution volumes.Techniques for measuring interstitial fluid pressure have been refined and reevaluated, approaching some concensus on slightly negative control pressures in soft connective tissues (0 to -4 mmHg), zero, or slightly positive pressure in other tissues.Interstitial pressure-volume curves have been recorded in several tissues, and progress has been made in clarifying the dependency of interstitial compliance on glycosaminoglycan-osmotic pressure, collagen, and microfibrils.
Effect of ambient winter air pollution on respiratory health of children with chronic respiratory symptoms.The acute respiratory effects of ambient air pollution were studied in a panel of 73 children with chronic respiratory symptoms in the winter of 1990 to 1991.The participating children were selected from all children aged 6 to 12 yr in Wageningen and Bennekom, two small, nonindustrial towns in the east of the Netherlands.Peak flow was measured twice daily with MiniWright meters.A diary was used to register the occurrence of acute respiratory symptoms and medication use by the children.Exposure to air pollution was characterized by the ambient concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), black smoke (BS), and particulate matter less than 10 microns (PM10).Associations between air pollution concentrations and health outcomes were analyzed using time series analysis.During the study period an air pollution episode occurred, with moderately elevated concentrations of PM10 and SO2.There were 6 days with 24-h average PM10 concentrations in excess of the WHO suggested lowest observed effect level of 110 micrograms/m3.After adjustment for ambient temperature, there were small but statistically significant negative associations of PM10, BS, and SO2 with both morning and evening PEF.There was a consistent positive association between PM10, BS, and SO2 with the prevalence of wheeze and bronchodilator use.Overall, the observed associations suggest a mild to moderate response to these moderately elevated levels of air pollution in a group of potentially sensitive children.
Antihypertensive drug therapy and the initiation of treatment for diabetes mellitus.OBJECTIVE: To quantify the risk for the occurrence of hyperglycemia requiring initiation of therapy among patients taking various antihypertensive regimens.DESIGN: Case-control study.SETTING: New Jersey Medicaid program.PATIENTS: The study included New Jersey Medicaid enrollees 35 years of age or older.The 11,855 case patients were newly started on a hypoglycemic agent (oral agent or insulin) between 1981 and 1990.The 11,855 controls were selected randomly from among other Medicaid enrollees.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The frequency of initiation of hypoglycemic therapy was increased for users of virtually all antihypertensive agents relative to nonusers after adjustment for age, gender, race, nursing home residency, number of days hospitalized, total number of prescriptions, and selected medication exposures.The estimated relative risk for initiation of hypoglycemic therapy was 1.40 for patients receiving thiazide diuretics (95% CI, 1.26 to 1.58) and ranged from 1.56 to 1.77 for patients receiving other antihypertensive medications, depending on the medication category.A higher risk was associated with multiple-agent regimens, whether they excluded a thiazide diuretic (odds ratio, 1.76;CI, 1.49 to 2.07) or included one (odds ratio, 1.93;CI, 1.75 to 2.13).When the analysis was restricted to users of antihypertensive agents (n = 8005), the risk associated with other single-agent antihypertensive regimens was not significantly different from that associated with thiazide diuretics.However, patients receiving multiple-agent regimens continued to be at increased risk for hyperglycemia requiring hypoglycemic therapy relative to those who used thiazide diuretic therapy alone.CONCLUSION: The association between antihypertensive therapy and the initiation of treatment for diabetes mellitus is more closely related to the intensity of therapy than to the individual agent used.Our data do not support the hypothesis that thiazide diuretics are more strongly associated with the initiation of hypoglycemic therapy than are other antihypertensive agents.
Assessment of patient function after limb-sparing surgery.Cancer rehabilitation is becoming more of a focus for the field of physiatry due to increased longevity and the side effects of treatment.In order to investigate the rehabilitation needs of patients undergoing limb-sparing procedures, chart analysis was conducted on 17 children treated for primary bone tumors by resection and an expandable endoprosthetic replacement.Each patient underwent a course of postoperative inpatient and outpatient physical therapy and was followed over an average of 2.5 years.Gait training was relatively straightforward and in seven patients required neither orthosis nor ambulatory aid.The other ten patients walked with a knee orthosis, axillary crutches, or both.Until the time came for reoperation to lengthen the implant, a shoe lift of 1in maximum was added to compensate for the limb length discrepancy.These findings compare favorably with the more complex requirements of high proximal amputees with external prostheses, including more difficult gait training and the need for frequent adjustments, as well as prosthetic replacement as the children grow.It is clear that children undergoing limb-sparing surgery have special needs that should be addressed, including early mobilization, gait training, adjustment to repeated brief hospitalizations for lengthening, and continued follow-up to monitor their activity restriction.
The effect of parity on the relation between maternal history of spontaneous pregnancy loss and the risk of sudden infant death syndrome in offspring.We conducted a population-based case-control study, using the 1984-1989 linked Washington State birth and death certificate data, to determine whether maternal prior spontaneous pregnancy loss was associated with the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).We identified 872 autopsied SIDS cases and 3,704 controls matched to cases on year of birth.To reduce the confounding from unmeasured socioeconomic and behavioral factors, we analyzed the data separately for infants with and without father's race provided on the birth certificate.Among infants whose father's race was known, those of multiparous women with a prior spontaneous pregnancy loss before 20 weeks gestational age were at reduced risk of SIDS, after adjustment for maternal age, prenatal smoking,a nd gravidity.An increased number of prior pregnancy losses was associated with a further reduction in the risk of SIDS: one prior pregnancy loss was associated with a 25% decrease [odds ratio (OR) = 0.75;95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.52-1.08], and two or more prior pregnancy losses was associated with a 47% decrease (OR = 0.53;95% CI = 0.30-0.94).There was no such association, however, among infants of women with no prior livebirth.Similar associations were observed between prior spontaneous pregnancy loss during the entire gestational period and the risk of SIDS in offspring.To explain the different associations between maternal prior pregnancy loss and the risk of SIDS observed among infants of women with and without a prior livebirth, we hypothesize an upward bias resulting from the presence of a larger proportion of infants of human leukocyte antigen-compatible couples among first liveborn infants.
Epidemic asthma in Cartagena, Spain, and its association with soybean sensitivity.We conducted a matched case-control study to assess the association between epidemic asthma and soybean sensitivity in Cartagena, Spain.In skin tests, 81% of the cases and no control subjects were positive to the commercial soybean allergen;87% of the cases and 12% of the controls were positive to the prepared soybean allergen;and 69% of the cases and 6% of the controls showed high levels of specific immunoglobulin E antibodies (odds ratio = 10;95% confidence interval = 1.4-433).The association remained strong after adjustment for total immunoglobulin E and for 28 other allergens.The results indicate that soybean sensitivity may be causing asthma epidemics in Cartagena.
Ovarian cancer.Survival and treatment differences by age.BACKGROUND.Cancer of the ovary is a disease of older American women with an incidence rate of 9.4 per 100,000 for those under 65 compared to 54.8 per 100,000 for those 65 years of age and over.METHODS.Over 22,000 women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer between 1973 and 1987 within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute.SEER is a population-based program that covers nearly 10% of the U.S. population for cancer incidence and survival.RESULTS.Ovarian cancer survival rates vary dramatically by stage.Within stage, however, differences are noted in survival by age, with younger women surviving better than older women even after adjustment for the general life expectancy of each age group (relative survival).For Stages III-IV disease, women under 45 years of age have a 5-year relative survival rate of over 45% compared to only 8% for those 85 years of age and over.Between 1973-1977 and 1983-1987, the treatment for Stages III-IV disease has changed.For all age groups, there were sharp increases in the percentage having surgery and chemotherapy/hormonal therapy and decreases in those having surgery and radiation as part of the first course of therapy.Over 40% of women 85 years of age and over did not receive any definitive treatment according to the hospital medical record.In 1983-1987, younger women received more combination therapy (surgery with chemotherapy/hormonal therapy) versus older women who received more single modalities such as surgery only or chemotherapy/hormonal therapy only.CONCLUSIONS.Older women with ovarian cancer are treated less aggressively than their younger counterparts and have poorer survival rates.
Treatment of ovarian cancer in elderly women.Mayo Clinic-North Central Cancer Treatment Group studies.BACKGROUND.With a 25% reduction in ovarian cancer mortality rate between 1973 and 1988 among younger American women, the overall control of ovarian cancer appeared to be improving.Unfortunately, American women older than 65 years of age experienced a 16% increase in mortality from this disease during that same interval.We examined our therapeutic outcomes following systemic chemotherapy administered to women of various ages accepted for treatment on phase III Mayo Clinic and North Central Cancer Treatment Group protocols between 1974 and 1988.METHODS.Three randomized studies of chemotherapy for Stage III and IV epithelial ovarian carcinoma were analyzed for possible effects of age on the results of treatment.All of the patients, regardless of age, had been enrolled and treated according to standard accession and dosage adjustment criteria.RESULTS.Among our 383 patients, 107 (28%) were 65 years of age or older.Although the elderly women tolerated our five different chemotherapy regimens nearly as well as did the younger patients, we found that progressively greater dose reductions were required for treatment continuation with advancing age between groups aged 44 years or younger, 45-64 years, and 65 years and older.When nonserous histology, Stage IV, ECOG performance status above 0, tumor grade above 1, and extent of residual disease greater than 2 cm were considered, our Cox model analysis yielded no firm evidence that age 65 years and older per se (P = 0.58) was a negative prognostic factor for survival.CONCLUSIONS.Elderly women eligible for randomized clinical trials tolerated Stage III and IV epithelial ovarian carcinoma and its chemotherapy nearly as well as did younger women.Among this population of women accepted for study in our three clinical trials, age 65 years and older per se was not proven to be a negative prognostic factor in our multivariate analysis.
Causal attribution, perceived control, and adjustment in patients with lung cancer.The relationships among causal attribution, perceived control, and adjustment to lung cancer were examined in 61 outpatients who had received a diagnosis of primary lung cancer.Data were collected using a structured interview and a self-report questionnaire.Both internal and external causal attributions were significantly positively correlated with perceived control.The relationship between internal causal attribution and perceived control was stronger.No significant relationships were found between perceived control and adjustment, although both internal and external causal attributions were significantly negatively correlated with aspects of adjustment.Recommendations are made for future research.
Influence of arterial blood pressure and aldosterone on left ventricular hypertrophy in moderate essential hypertension.In a group of 36 untreated patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (office systolic blood pressure [SBP] 160 +/- 3.4 mm Hg, office diastolic blood pressure [DBP], 102 +/- 1.5 mm Hg), 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and determination of left ventricular (LV) mass index according to the formula of Devereux were performed.After an overnight fast, blood samples were taken for the determination of serum aldosterone levels and plasma renin activity.Urinary catecholamine concentrations were assayed from 24-hour urine collections.Left ventricular mass index (143.7 +/- 8 g/m2) did not correlate significantly with either office SBP or office DBP.The correlation of LV mass index with mean 24-hour SBP (145 +/- 3 mm Hg) was statistically significant: r = 0.395, p = 0.026.However, the best correlation was obtained with mean 24-hour DBP (90 +/- 3 mm Hg) with r = 0.499 (p = 0.004).Urinary catecholamine levels did not correlate with LV mass index.In addition, LV mass index correlated significantly with plasma renin activity (r = 0.346, p = 0.050) and serum aldosterone levels (r = 0.559, p = 0.0009).There was a strongly significant correlation between LV mass index and serum aldosterone levels even after adjustment for mean 24-hour SBP (r = 0.496, p = 0.005) and DBP (r = 0.514, p = 0.004).These results demonstrate that ambulatory blood pressure determinations but not office blood pressure parameters correlate well with left ventricular hypertrophy in essential hypertension.Nonhemodynamic factors are important determinants of left ventricular mass as well.
Pulmonary function studies in healthy non-smoking women of Calcutta.Pulmonary function measurements were made in 230 healthy non-smoking women from Calcutta with an age range of 20-59 years.The tests consisted of vital capacity (VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced expiratory volume in one second as a percentage of forced vital capacity (FEV1%), forced expiratory time (FET), maximum voluntary ventilation, uncontrolled frequency (MVVF), forced expiratory flow (FEF200-1200ml), forced mid-expiratory flow (FEF25-75%), forced end-expiratory flow (FEF75-80%) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR).Except for PEFR, all the measurements were made with the help of two 9-litre closed-circuit-type expirographs using standard spirometric techniques.PEFR was recorded with the help of two Wright peak flow meters.Prediction formulae were derived on the basis of physical characteristics.Age and height were found to be the significant predictor variables for VC, FVC and FEV1, while only age was significant for FEV1%.The FVC and FEV1 values of the subjects, standardized for age and height, are much lower than those of Americans, Europeans and Jordanians.On comparison with data reported from other parts of India, it was revealed that the VC and FEV1 values of the current study, after adjustment for age and height, were much higher than those of Southern Indians but comparable with those of North-Western Indians.
Horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase-catalyzed oxidation of aldehydes: dismutation precedes net production of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.The oxidation of aldehydes by horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HL-ADH) is more complex than previously recognized.At low enzyme concentrations and/or high aldehyde concentrations, a pronounced lag in the assay progress curve is observed when the reaction is monitored for NADH production at 340 nm.When the progress of the reaction is followed by 1H NMR spectroscopy, rapid dismutation of the aldehyde substrate into the corresponding acid and alcohol is observed during the lag phase.Steady-state production of NADH commences only after aldehyde concentrations drop below 5% of their initial value;thereafter, NADH production occurs with continuous adjustment of the equilibrium between aldehyde, alcohol, NADH, and NAD+.The steady-state NADH production exhibits normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics and is in accord with earlier studies using much higher enzyme concentrations where no lag phase was reported.These results establish that the ability of HL-ADH to oxidize aldehydes is much greater than previously thought.The relationship between aldehyde dismutase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities of HL-ADH is discussed.
Muscle strength in osteoporotic versus normal women.Strong back muscles contribute to good posture and skeletal support.Osteoporosis, being a metabolic bone disease, should not affect muscle strength.In this study we were interested in comparing the back extensor strength (BES) of osteoporotic and normal women.Fifty-five women ages 40-85 years who had a documented diagnosis of osteoporosis and were referred for initiation of proper exercise programs were included in our study after meeting the inclusion criteria.They all had evaluation of their posture, back and upper extremity strength, and physical activity score through our Rehabilitation of Osteoporosis Program--Exercise (ROPE).In addition, to avoid the interference of pain on application of maximal effort, we did not include subjects with acute back pain or those who experienced back pain with maximal effort during the testing trial.BES for osteoporotic women ranged from 16 to 65 lb (mean +/- SD, 36.5 +/- 15.5) for ages 40-59 years, 9 to 55 lb (mean +/- SD, 29.9 +/- 10.6) for ages 60-69 years, 6 to 52 lb (mean +/- SD, 24.3 +/- 10.2) for ages 70-79 years, and 17 to 27 lb (mean +/- SD, 21.2 +/- 4.2) for ages 80 years or older.Comparison of these data with the BES of 25 normal women, with statistical adjustment for age, demonstrated that the osteoporotic women had significantly lower BES than the normal women.A longitudinal study of a larger group of women would be of great interest for clarifying whether the weakness of back extensors precedes and, indeed, contributes to compression fractures of the spine.
Impaired glucose tolerance and its relationship to ECG-indicated coronary heart disease and risk factors among Chinese.Da Qing IGT and diabetes study.OBJECTIVE--To determine the prevalence of IGT and diabetes and identify the occurrence of CVD and its risk factors.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--This study was a population-based, cross-sectional study of 110,660 residents, 25-74 yr of age of DaQing, Hei Long Jiang Province, China.RESULTS--Using 1985 WHO criteria, 577 (5.5/1000) subjects with IGT and 630 (6.0/1000) with newly diagnosed diabetes were identified.In addition, 190 (1.7/1000) with previously known diabetes were identified.Hypertension, obesity, and abnormal albumin excretion were twice as frequent in those with IGT as in 279 men and 240 women of similar age and sex distribution who had normal OGTTs.Plasma cholesterol and TGs were higher, and HDL cholesterol was lower in subjects with IGT than in nondiabetic subjects.Those with IGT had a prevalence of electrocardiographically recognized CHD 9.5-fold greater than the normoglycemic subjects.Subjects with IGT had higher plasma insulin concentrations, but the 1-h insulin-glucose ratio after the 75-g glucose load was lower.In a forward stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis, IGT itself remained an independent factor associated with CHD after adjustment for age, sex, cigarette smoking, plasma cholesterol, BP, and obesity.CONCLUSIONS--Therefore, in China, IGT may occur with almost as high a frequency as diabetes and is accompanied by an increased frequency of CVD and its risk factors.Estimates from this study indicate that > 12.0% of all ECG-indicated CHD in the Da Qing population occurs in individuals with IGT and NIDDM.The IGT subjects identified in this survey form the cohort for a long-term follow-up and intervention study.
Bioimpedance analysis and resting energy expenditure in undernourished and refed anorectic patients.Anthropometry, bioimpedance analysis (BIA) and resting energy expenditure (REE) were evaluated in young female patients affected by anorexia nervosa who were either severely malnourished (MnA) or already refed (RfA) and in a control group of healthy young women (WnC).Fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM), evaluated from skinfold thickness, were severely decreased in the MnA group while they were very similar in the RfA group and in the WnC group.With respect to BIA parameters, impedance (Z) was significantly higher in absolute terms in the MnA but lower than in the other groups when expressed as specific impedance, i.e. after normalization for both FFM and height.Phase angle significantly differed between the three groups, being significantly (P < 0.01) lower in the MnA (3.70 +/- 0.83 degrees) and the RfA (4.36 +/- 0.82) than in the WnC (5.17 +/- 0.40).REE was comparable in RfA subjects and WnC subjects, while it was sharply decreased (P < 0.01) in the MnA patients both in absolute value and after adjustment for body composition (FFM and FM) or body weight.This cross-sectional study shows that marked changes in BIA parameters occur in undernourished anorectic patients and also in the anorectic subjects who were previously very underweight but studied only after having already regained a normal body size.REE was deeply decreased in the undernourished anorectic women even when the differences in body composition or Wt were taken into account, indicating the occurrence of a significant adaptation of energy expenditure to chronic underfeeding.
Is high-flux dialysis cost-effective?High-flux dialysis is a new method for providing routine-maintenance hemodialysis to patients with end-stage renal disease.It promises to shorten the duration of the dialysis session, but poses potential clinical risks to patients and financial risks to dialysis centers because of the high unit cost of purchasing new dialysis equipment.We retrospectively evaluated the cost-effectiveness of high-flux dialysis compared to conventional dialysis in a hospital-based center.The center provided only conventional dialysis until March 1989, when it initiated high-flux dialysis.The estimated annual costs of treatment were US $31,249 (high-flux) and $32,562 (conventional).The rate of hospital admissions was almost identical in both groups (conventional, 1.29 admissions per year;high-flux, 1.24 admissions per year;p = 0.23).Predicted prolongation of life expectancy with high-flux dialysis was significantly higher after statistical adjustment for observable patient characteristics (1.8 to 4.5 years;p < 0.01).The cost-effectiveness ratio was $28,188 per life-year saved for high-flux compared to conventional dialysis.These findings suggest that the added capital expense of purchasing high-flux equipment can be justified from the perspective of its societal cost-effectiveness.
Familial aggregation of periodontal indices.Analysis of three measures of periodontal health (plaque index, gingival index, and attachment loss) was carried out on 178 individuals in 75 families examined as part of a family study of periodontal health.Original participants in this study were volunteers recruited from the University of Maryland Dental Clinic, and were selected independently of any specific dental disease or condition.Relatives were invited to participate in the family study so that the extent of familial aggregation of indices of periodontal health could be assessed.By means of an analysis of variance model for persons nested within families, evidence for familial aggregation of plaque index was found both before and after adjustment for covariates such as age, gender, race, and reported oral hygiene habits.While a substantial fraction of variance in gingival index and attachment loss was also due to differences among families, neither attained statistical significance in these data.Examination of familial correlations (e.g., parent-offspring, sib-sib, spouse correlations) confirmed that plaque index showed greater familial resemblance compared with other measures of periodontal health.Both mean gingival index and mean attachment loss showed a stronger correlation between mothers and offspring compared with fathers and offspring.This suggests that further analysis of models for separating genetic and environmental effects may be appropriate for plaque index, but complete analysis of other periodontal indices will require more flexible statistical models for separation of genetic and cultural inheritance while considering gender-specific expression and transmission, as well as incorporation of information from covariates.

Hypertension and dyslipidemia in patients with insulinoma.Hyperinsulinemia is alleged to contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension and dyslipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia) in the setting of insulin resistance.To assess the association among hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia in the absence of insulin resistance, we determined their prevalence in a large cohort of patients with insulinoma (N = 250).In this retrospective case-control study, patients with insulinoma were matched by age, gender, race, and year of operation with 217 control patients admitted to the hospital for elective cholecystectomy.Mean preoperative blood pressure measurements were compared between study patients and control patients.In addition, age-, gender-, and race-specific percentiles of blood pressure were compared with data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I, and those of triglycerides (N = 65) and cholesterol (N = 70) were compared with Mayo Clinic normal reference data.The study group consisted of 105 men and 145 women;the median age was 41 years (range, 8 to 82).The median duration of symptoms before operation was 1.9 years (range, 0.05 to 40 years).After adjustment for body mass index, no statistically significant differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were noted between patients with insulinoma and matched control patients (131 +/- 19 versus 128 +/- 18 mm Hg and 81 +/- 11 versus 79 +/- 9 mm Hg, respectively).No relationship was observed between duration of hyperinsulinemia (as long as 40 years) and blood pressure.The age- and gender-specific percentiles of systolic and diastolic blood pressure of the patients with insulinoma did not differ from the age- and gender-specific percentiles for the general white population.
Gender differences in the perceptions of common cold symptoms.Higher rates of reported morbidity among women are sometimes attributed to lower thresholds among women for experiencing and reporting symptoms.Gender differences in the perception of signs and symptoms of minor illness were examined on data from the MRC Common Cold Unit.Volunteers assessed the presence and severity of colds at the end of their stay in the Unit, using the same two measures as a trained clinical observer (all ratings were double blind).Even after adjustment for other variables, men were significantly more likely to 'over-rate' their symptoms in comparison with the clinical observer than were women.These data, and recent analyses from elsewhere, suggest that rather than artefactually exaggerating gender differences in morbidity, differing thresholds for perceiving and reporting symptoms may produce underestimates of gender differences in morbidity.
Antidepressant treatment of tinnitus patients: report of a randomized clinical trial and clinical prediction of benefit.Ninety-two middle-aged and elderly patients with disabling tinnitus participated in a double-blind randomized clinical trial comparing nortriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) to placebo.The study was stratified for presence (n = 38) or absence (n = 54) of current major depression (by DSM-III criteria).Both active drug and placebo were given for 6 weeks following a dose adjustment phase;the median nightly dose of nortriptyline was 100 mg.The two primary outcome variables were global satisfaction questions: However, tinnitus severity was not significantly affected by nortriptyline (active: 43%;placebo: 30%;chi-square = 1.567, p = N/S).Benefit was more likely to be reported by depressed patients, by patients with insomnia, by women, and by patients without cervical musculoskeletal disease.Nortriptyline is useful in some patients with disabling tinnitus, but has not been shown to directly affect tinnitus sensation.Placebo effects were strongly significant and must be considered important in tinnitus therapy.It is difficult to specify the most appropriate outcome measures for tinnitus therapeutic trials.
The adversarial alliance: developing therapeutic relationships between families and the team in brain injury rehabilitation.Families of individuals who have survived brain injuries experience significant distress, and may resist accepting their relative's neurobehavioural deficits.Staff who work with brain-injured patients and their relatives are charged with the seemingly paradoxical task of helping families support rehabilitative efforts and be goal-oriented, while simultaneously communicating often negative realities about prognosis.In the midst of what may be an intermittently conflict-laden relationship, families and staff must become synergistically involved in a therapeutic partnership.This paper defines aspects of this 'adversarial alliance' which is often established between families and staff.The relationship between patient discharge outcome and perceived family stress and satisfaction with the rehabilitation programme was reviewed.Data analyses yielded the following conclusions: families evaluated retrospectively to have been 'highly stressed' were also perceived to experience more conflict with the rehabilitation team;family stress was related to poorer adjustment to the patient's disability (at admission);greater family/team conflict correlated with lower cognitive and physical functioning at admission, longer length of stay, younger patient age, and lower programme satisfaction.Implications for programme development and treatment guidelines are discussed.
The psychological adjustment of the Chinese community in Britain.A study of two generations.The psychological health and adjustment to life in Britain of a sample of first- and second-generation Chinese immigrants were measured.It was predicted that problems with the English language, inadequate social support, value differences, and unfulfilled expectations would induce more symptoms of psychological distress and depression in first-generation than in second-generation Chinese immigrants.Overall psychological health, and hence adjustment, was good.There was evidence for language problems and unfulfilled expectations, but not social support and value differences, being linked to mental health in the second generation.Evidence linking mental health to other personal variables was found in both generations.
The effect of clozapine on cognition and psychiatric symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.Psychiatric symptoms and cognition were assessed in 13 patients with schizophrenia, one patient with schizoaffective disorder, and one patient with psychosis not otherwise specified while they received a conventional neuroleptic and again after an average of 15 months on clozapine.Despite improvements in psychiatric symptoms, attention, memory, and higher-level problem-solving were essentially unchanged.This suggests that certain cognitive deficits are relatively independent of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia, and are probably central and enduring features of the disorder.Cognitive disability appeared to have been rate-limiting in the sample's rehabilitation, as patients' social and vocational adjustment remained marginal during the study.We also observed that treatment with clozapine was associated with a decline in some memory functions;the potent anticholinergic properties of the drug may have been responsible for this.
Enhancing effect of ethanol on esophageal tumor development in rats by initiation of diethylnitrosamine.The effects of ethanol on initiation of esophageal tumorigenesis by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) were investigated in male F344 rats.Animals were administered 50 p.p.m.DEN plus 10% ethanol (Group 1), 33 p.p.m.DEN (Group 2), 50 p.p.m.DEN (Group 3) or 10% ethanol (Group 4) in the drinking water for the first 8 weeks, and were then maintained on basal diet and tap water for up to 104 weeks.The concentration of 33 p.p.m.DEN in Group 2 was an adjustment to the anticipated intake in Group 1.Consequent total intakes of DEN in Groups 2 and 3 were respectively 80% and 134% of that in Group 1.Histopathological examination of esophagus tissue after final sacrifice revealed incidences of papillomas and/or carcinomas in Groups 1, 2 and 3 to be 57.7, 3.8 and 10.7% respectively.No esophageal tumors occurred in Group 4.The incidence of hyperplasia was 100% in Group 1 in contrast to 46.2% in Group 2, 57.1% in Group 3 and 3.6% in Group 4.Thus, the incidences of esophageal proliferative lesions were significantly higher in Group 1 than in Groups 2 or 3.Our results clearly indicate that ethanol has an enhancing effect on the development of esophageal tumors induced by DEN in rats, when administered during the initiation phase.
Second natural history study of congenital heart defects.Materials and methods.Results of the location and recruitment efforts and comparisons of responses from patients who cooperated at different levels in the Second Natural History Study of Congenital Heart Defects are included because they influenced the choice of analytic methods and are essential to the generalizability of the results to the entire study cohort.Included are examination and data collection protocols (e.g., protocol definitions, test procedures, and data editing), statistical methods (e.g., box plots, survival curves, multivariable models, and rate adjustment), participation results (e.g., proportional odds analysis, mortality, location, recruitment, and full participants, including comparison of questionnaire responses and comparison of questionnaire response and physician history), and a discussion.
Detection of H2O2 release from vascular endothelial cells.Endothelial cells are both significant sources and targets of reactive oxygen species, including O2.-, H2O2, .OH, .NO, and ONOO-, which play important roles in vascular homeostatic mechanisms and pathogenic processes.To better quantify cell oxidant metabolism processes, a fluorescence technique has been developed to measure H2O2 release from bovine aortic endothelial cells.Incubation of H2O2 with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) results in HRP-mediated oxidation of p-hydroxy-phenylacetic acid (PHPA) to the fluorescent PHPA dimer, 2,2'-dihydroxy-biphenyl-5,5' diacetate [(PHPA)2].The HRP-mediated dimerization of 5 mM PHPA with concentrations of H2O2 up to 2.5 mM resulted in a linear increase in fluorescence (R = .995, n = 8).Maximal fluorescence occurred at 2.9 mM H2O2, with greater H2O2 concentrations yielding products with altered spectrophotometric characteristics and decreased fluorescent yield.The fluorescence of (PHPA)2 was pH sensitive and increased 500-fold from pH to 9.Fluorescence versus pH profiles were adjusted to a Henderson-Hasselbalch fitting, with a 50% maximal emission at pH = 8.1 +/- 0.2.The apparent pKa of fluorescence emission correlated well with a weak range of buffering capacity of (PHPA)2, which had a pKa = 8.0 +/- 0.1.With cells maintained in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), the pH can increase to 7.90 during 3 h, with the increased pH due to the loss of HCO3- from HBSS.After adjustment for pH changes, a linear cellular H2O2 release of 217 pmol H2O2.min-1.mg protein-1 was observed.When bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were incubated with HBSS and PHPA alone, 50% less fluorescence was observed than when HRP was added.
Comparison of MMPI-2 scores of foreign Chinese and Caucasian-American students.MMPI-2 scores of foreign Chinese students (n = 25) were compared to those of a matched sample of Caucasian students (n = 21) and to normative data on American college students.Although responses for all groups were within normal limits, Chinese men appeared more socially introverted than Caucasian men.Relative to Caucasian women, Chinese women were more defensive, depressed, unaware of somatic and psychosocial problems, and gender astereotypic in interests.These tentative findings are discussed in terms of ethnicity and adjustment.
Relative importance of psychologic traits and severity of ischemia in causing angina during treadmill exercise.Canadian Amlodipine/Atenolol in Silent Ischemia Study (CASIS) Investigators.OBJECTIVES.This study was conducted to compare the influence of psychologic traits versus ischemia severity on the occurrence of angina during treadmill exercise.BACKGROUND.Some studies suggest that angina is associated with certain psychologic traits, whereas others show an association with more severe ischemia.The relative influence of these two factors and the extent to which they interact are not known.METHODS.Off-drug treadmill exercise testing and a battery of psychologic tests were performed on 122 patients with known coronary artery disease.Psychologic tests measured sensitivity to physical symptoms, denial and deception, type A behavior, anger, hostility, depression, marital adjustment and amount of external stress.Stepwise logistic regression was used to determine the independent association of psychologic traits, ischemic threshold and exercise tolerance with the occurrence of angina.RESULTS.Angina during treadmill exercise was reported by 66 of 122 patients.On univariate testing, angina was positively associated with sensitivity to physical symptoms (p < 0.001), type A behavior (p = 0.021) and depression (p = 0.032) and was negatively associated with exercise tolerance (p < 0.001) and work load threshold for ischemia (p < 0.01).Multivariate analysis revealed independent and additive associations of angina with sensitivity to physical symptoms (p = 0.003), exercise capacity (p = 0.003) and work load threshold for ischemia (p = 0.018).Once these were included in a logistic model, depression and type A behavior were no longer significant.Other psychologic traits showed no association with angina.CONCLUSIONS.Sensitivity to physical symptoms, ischemic threshold and exercise tolerance are independently associated with angina, with sensitivity to physical symptoms having the stronger influence.The physiologic and psychologic mechanisms underlying symptom perception have an influence on angina that is independent of and additive to the severity of underlying ischemia.
DSM-III-R disorders in Vietnamese refugees.Prevalence and correlates.This study's purpose was a) to determine the prevalence of DSM-III-R disorders in newly arrived ethnic Vietnamese and ethnic Chinese refugees from Vietnam and b) to determine the correlates of DSM-III-R disorders.A Vietnamese-speaking psychiatrist administered translated sections of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R to 201 Vietnamese new arrivals undergoing mandatory health screening.Overall, 18.4% had one or more current disorders: 8.5% had adjustment disorder and 5.5% had major depression.Ethnic Vietnamese, compared with ethnic Chinese, had significantly (p < .05) higher rates of current posttraumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.Ethnic differences in psychopathology were largely explained by the fact that ethnic Vietnamese refugees had experienced more traumatic events and separation from family.After adjusting for ethnicity, refugees who reported traumatic events, refugees who were married, and veterans were significantly (p < .05) more likely to have one or more psychiatric disorders.
