[Renin-angiotensin system]Renin is a key enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) which controls the blood pressure and electrolyte balance.By numerous studies on RAS and structures of renin and prorenin, the determination of three-dimensional structure for renin has been thought to be important in the rational approach to the drug design for antihypertensives.Here, several investigations for the three-dimensional structure of human and mouse renins are reviewed.These papers showed that the active site cleft had a less open arrangement in renins than that in other aspartic proteinases, although the general topology of both renins were quite similar.They also described subsites of renins and others.
[Molecular biology of the natriuretic peptide system]The natriuretic peptide system is composed of at least three distinct endogenous peptides: atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), and three receptors: ANP-A receptor/GC-A, ANP-B receptor/GC-B and the clearance receptor.This system influences the control of body fluid and blood pressure as cardiac hormones and local regulators.Recent advances in molecular biology have unravel the molecular mechanism of the natriuretic peptide system and have facilitated our understanding of it.The present review gives the current knowledge of the molecular biology of the natriuretic peptide system.
Somatosensory regulation of regional hippocampal blood flow in anesthetized rats.The effect of noxious or non-noxious mechanical stimulation of various cutaneous areas on cerebral blood flow in hippocampus was examined with laser Doppler flowmetry in urethane-anesthetized artificially-ventilated rats.Noxious mechanical stimulation (pinching) of the skin on the face, forepaw, chest, or hindpaw for 20s increased regional hippocampal blood flow (Hpc-BF) and systemic blood pressure, but non-noxious mechanical stimulation (brushing) had no such effect.After the spinal cord was transected at T1 level a forepaw pinch caused no change in blood pressure but still increased Hpc-BF.This suggests that cutaneous noxious stimulation can induce pressor-independent increases in Hpc-BF.The increase in Hpc-BF induced by a forepaw pinch in T1-transected rats was partially reduced by intravenous administration of mecamylamine (2 mg/kg), a nicotinic cholinergic receptor antagonist.Atropine (0.5 mg/kg), a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist was ineffective.These data indicate that the cholinergic vasodilative system is involved in the somatically-induced increase in Hpc-BF via activation of the nicotinic cholinergic receptors.
Effect of verapamil on ventilatory and circulatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia in normal subjects.Recent investigations have shown that the calcium channel blocker verapamil attenuated the hypoxic ventilatory chemosensitivity of carotid body in animals.To determine whether this is also the case in humans, transient physiological chemodenervation by O2 breaths (withdrawal test) during sustained hypoxia (N = 7), and ventilatory and circulatory responses to progressive hypoxia and hypercapnia (N = 8) were examined after oral administration of verapamil.During sustained hypoxia after verpamil, there was a significant reduction of withdrawal response from 5th to 25th min value (p < 0.01), but not after placebo.On the other hand, no significant difference in ventilatory responses to progressive hypoxia and hypercapnia was observed after verapamil.Verapamil run reveals similar features with placebo run in circulatory parameters except blood pressure response, which tended to be suppressed by verapamil.We conclude that verapamil attenuates peripheral chemoreceptor activity with time during sustained mild hypoxia in normal adult humans and this may be explained by delayed depletion in intracellular Ca2+ for chemotransduction of the peripheral chemoreceptors.
ATP-sensitive K+ channels are gradually recruited in the vasodepressor response to adenosine in spinally-anesthetized dogs.Vasodepressor mechanisms of adenosine were investigated in spinally-anesthetized dogs.An i.v.-infusion of adenosine (0.1-10 mumol/kg/min) caused a slowly developing and sustained decrease in blood pressure (BP).This vasodepression was antagonized by glibenclamide, a blocker of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels.On the other hand, a transient decrease in BP caused by a single bolus i.v.-injection of adenosine was not antagonized by glibenclamide in our previous study.These results suggested that the opening of KATP channels is gradually recruited in the vasodepressor mechanisms for adenosine-induced sustained vasodepression.
A noninvasive method of measuring Max(dP/dt) of the left ventricle by Doppler echocardiography.Although slightly affected by alterations in preload, the maximum first derivative of left ventricular pressure with respect to time, Max(dP/dt), is widely regarded as a simple and convenient index of cardiac contractility for clinical use.The feasibility of noninvasive, hence repeatable, measurement of Max(dP/dt) will certainly lead to re-evaluation of its usefulness.Max(dP/dt) is given by the following equation: Max(dP/dt) = rho c Max(du/dt), where rho is the blood density, c the pulse wave velocity, and mu the flow velocity in the aorta.This equation has been previously validated in animal experiments and has now been applied to the clinical setting for the first time.In 20 patients without aortic stenosis, left ventricular pressure was measured with a catheter-tip micromanometer, aortic ejection flow velocity was measured by Doppler echocardiography, and pulse wave velocity by mechanocardiography or Doppler echocardiography.Then, delta c Max (du/dt was calculated from the measured data and compared with measured Max (dP/dt).A significant positive correlation was found between them (rho c Max (du/dt) = 0.96 x Max (dP/dt) + 6.52, r = 0.83, p < 0.001).In 11 patients with hypertension, rho c Max (du/dt) was obtained before and after long-term (average 13.1 months) treatment with antihypertensive drugs.In spite of the expected reduction in blood pressure and the regression of left ventricular mass, rho c Max (du/dt) remaioned unchanged.In 9 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, the effects of beta 1-agonist were tested at the beginning of therapy (30 mg/day denopamine) and 6 months later.The increase in rho c Max (du/dt) observed 1 hour after oral administration of he drug had not changed significantly 6 months later.We conclude that the index rho c Max (du/dt), is useful in assessing the contractile state of the left ventricle noninvasively.
A general method of determining the frequency-dependent propagation coefficient and characteristic impedance of an artery in the presence of reflections.An iterative method of calculating propagation parameters at harmonics of heart rate for a uniform vascular segment from a combination of four arterial waveform measurements is presented.Measurements of blood pressure, vascular diameter, and blood flow-rate may be combined arbitrarily provided only that at least one measurement of pressure and one of flow-rate be included;the requirement of four measurements implies at least two measurement sites along the vessel.The analysis is thus a generalization of those associated with previous methods of determining propagation parameters, allowing for instance relaxation of the requirement of equal spacing in the three-point method.Results are presented for the propagation of an impulse along a rubber tube when the measurements are pressure at two sites, flow-rate and diameter.
Possible sources of discrepancy between sphygmomanometer cuff pressure and blood pressure quantified in a collapsible-tube analogue.This paper examines the assumption that the audible events detected as Korotkov sounds in sphygmomanometry occur when blood pressure equals arm-cuff pressure.Several effects that contribute to discrepancy between these pressures are quantified using an idealised arm-and-cuff system consisting of a thick-walled collapsible tube subject to external compression along a central part of its length.The effects studied are (1) transverse pressure difference, resulting from tissues sustaining a part of the external compression through (a) circumferential bending stiffness and (b) longitudinal curvature of the tensed localised neck at the site of initial collapse, (2) longitudinal pressure difference between upstream pressure and pressure at the collapse point due to both (a) viscous and (b) inertial pressure drop.These effects are found to compensate partially for each other;the pressure within the vessel at the collapse point is less than the cuff pressure, but is also less than the blood pressure at the upstream end of the cuff.All four of the contributing terms increase proportionally to the flow-rate raised to a power greater than one, except the viscous pressure drop.Owing to a progressive shortening of the collapsed neck as flow-rate increases, the viscous term is almost independent of the flow-rate.The overall discrepancy displays less flow-rate dependency and is smaller than some of the terms which contribute to it.This means that considerable accuracy is needed if measurements of the effects are to be used to correct the raw data on cuff pressure at the time of Korotkov sound emission so as to obtain an improved estimate of the blood pressure.
Blood flow in a brachial artery compressed externally by a pneumatic cuff.Blood flow in human brachial arteries, compressed by a pneumatic cuff for blood pressure measurement, is examined using several different noninvasive techniques.From the experimental results it is shown that, when arterial pressure distal to the cuff is always lower than cuff pressure, flow in the artery under the cuff becomes supercritical near the cuff downstream margin and no reflection occurs there and the reflected wave from the peripheral vascular system of the arm does not propagate beyond the cuff downstream margin.Therefore an unsteady transition from supercritical to subcritical flow occurs near the cuff downstream margin.When the peak value of distal arterial pressure exceeds cuff pressure, a reflection occurs near the cuff downstream margin.The reflection becomes stronger corresponding to decrement of the cuff pressure and the whole artery segment under the cuff inflates fully at systole.At diastole, however, the artery segment under the cuff does not collapse completely and, hence, the phenomenon becomes that of pressure wave propagation in a partially collapsed artery segment.
[Shy-Drager syndrome: its autonomic function, alpha 2 receptor density and mechanism of postprandial hypotension]The autonomic function, platelet alpha 2 receptor (alpha 2R) density, and mechanism of postprandial hypotension were examined in a 58-year-old man with Shy-Drager syndrome (SDS).His chief complaints were orthostatic syncope and impotence.His blood pressure was kept within normal limits in a supine position, but severe hypotension and fainting occurred when he assumed an upright posture.There were diminished sweating response to warm stress, abnormal pupil reactions to drugs, lack of blood pressure elevation at phase IV during the Valsalva maneuver, and a lack of pressor response to hyperventilation and cold stress.The plasma norepinephrine levels (pNE) were very low in a supine position at rest and in a head-up tilt position.Severe blood pressure fall (hypotension) associated with a lack of pNE elevation occurred during an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT).Platelet alpha 2R density increased and the pressor response to infused norepinephrine (NE-R) was pronounced.The heart rate response to injected atropine was clearly attenuated.The coefficient of the R-R interval variation in the ECG (CVRR), which may reflect parasympathetic activity, was markedly low at rest.In addition, a decrease in a head-up tilt position and increase during oGTT also resolved.These results indicate that a dysfunction of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems and the up-regulation in the alpha 2R system that leads to an increase in alpha 2R density in SDS are involved in this disease and that the mechanism of postprandial hypotension in SDS may be different from that in normal elderly subjects.
[Surgical treatment of renal artery stenosis in children 60 surgically treated cases]Sixty children with renal artery stenosis (unilateral in 44, bilateral in 16) underwent surgical treatment.Ten nephrectomies and 69 vascular repair procedures were performed.Postoperative follow-up ranged from one to 14 years.After surgery, blood pressure returned to normal and subsequently remained so in 54 patients without any antihypertensive medication.This represents a 90% cure rate.In six patients blood pressure remained high due to lesions of the renal parenchyma.Fibrous dysplasia of the renal artery was the prevailing pathologic finding.In children, associated lesions are especially frequent: coarctation of the abdominal aorta, stenosis, occlusion, aneurysms of the splanchnic arteries, pheochromocytoma.Postoperative prognosis of renovascular hypertension in children is good since atheroma and visceral or renal lesions are usually lacking.
Effects of arginine vasopressin on blood pressure and renal prostaglandin E2 in rabbits.The role of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in blood pressure regulation in humans and animals is still controversial.The present study was designed to investigate the effects of AVP on blood pressure and the excretion of sodium and prostaglandin (PG) E2 in rabbits.AVP dissolved in 0.01 M acetic acid was infused subcutaneously at a rate of 0.86 ng/kg/min with a miniosmotic pump into 12 New Zealand white rabbits (2.7-3.4 kg), while 10 controls were given vehicle alone.AVP infusion resulted in a 3.5-fold rise in the level of plasma AVP (21.8 +/- 4.4 (SEM) pg/ml) as compared with controls, associated with a significant decrease in the urine volume and urinary excretion of sodium.The PGE2 excretion was increased 1.8-fold after AVP infusion.In the chronic AVP-infused group, blood pressure was not significantly increased, but the acute vascular response to AVP was significantly attenuated without any changes in the vasopressor response to angiotensin II.Preadministration of V1-antagonist completely abolished the vasopressor action of AVP, but not that of angiotensin II, in either group.These results suggest that circulating AVP within physiological range of concentrations may stimulate renal PGE2 synthesis and attenuate the vascular response through vascular V1 receptors without affecting the baroreflex, which may be attenuated through V2 receptors.
[An epidemiological study on blood pressure distribution and on the prevalence of arterial hypertension in a population of 1000 Roman children]
[Intraeffort tension evolution in normotensive, borderline, and mild hypertensive subjects]391 patients were studied, 288 males whose average age was forty years old, and 103 females whose average age was forty-five years old.They were divided into three groups, according to the values of the diastolic blood pressure in basal conditions: a) Normotensive (less than 90);b) Borderline (90);c) Mild Hypertensive (95-100 mm Hg).Comparison between sexes and ages was also carried out, being these last results analyzed in two groups: from 20 to 40 years old and from 41 to 69 years old.The values of statistical significance were as follows: as to the group, both basal systolic and diastolic blood pressure, systolic and diastolic at 600 KGM and at 5 minutes of recuperation.As to sex: basal cardiac frequency at 600 KGM and diastolic blood pressure at 5 minutes of recuperation.Body weight did not show correlation with systolic or diastolic blood pressure at 600 KGM.
Nitric oxide inhibits resting sphincter of Oddi activity.The sphincter of Oddi has basal myogenic phasic activity that is modulated by neural and hormonal pathways.Stimulatory innervation to this organ is cholinergic, whereas the inhibitory pathways are unknown.Nitric oxide (NO), generated from L-arginine, relaxes gastrointestinal smooth muscle in vitro.We, therefore, hypothesized that resting sphincter of Oddi and duodenal motilities are regulated by a NO-mediated inhibitory pathway.In 23 anesthetized prairie dogs, systemic blood pressure and sphincter of Oddi and duodenal motilities were monitored during systemic infusion of N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase.L-NAME was infused alone and simultaneously with excess D- and L-arginine.L-NAME alone and L-NAME with D-arginine produced hypertension and increased sphincter of Oddi and duodenal motilities.L-arginine blocked these increases, suggesting that baseline sphincter of Oddi and duodenal motility regulation involves the generation of NO from L-arginine.We conclude that baseline sphincter of Oddi phasic activity is regulated by cholinergic stimulatory and NO-mediated inhibitory neural pathways.
Vascular hyporeactivity to vasoconstrictor agents and hemodynamic decompensation in hemorrhagic shock is mediated by nitric oxide.This study investigates the role of nitric oxide (NO) and the induction of a calcium-independent NO synthase (NOS) in development of vascular hyporeactivity to norepinephrine (NE) and vascular decompensation associated with hemorrhagic shock (HS) in the anesthetized rat.HS for 120 min caused a time-dependent reduction of the pressor responses to NE.This hyporeactivity is mediated by an enhanced release of NO by the constitutive NOS, for it was reversed by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (NO2Arg), an inhibitor of both constitutive and inducible NOS, but it was not prevented by dexamethasone, an inhibitor of NOS induction.Vascular decompensation following prolonged periods of HS was characterized by a failure of control animals to maintain arterial blood pressures despite reinfusion of blood.This progressive decrease in blood pressure is mediated by enhanced formation of NO by the inducible NOS, for it was prevented by NO2Arg or dexamethasone.A strong increase in calcium-independent (inducible) NOS activity was observed in several organs after 150 and 330 min of HS, being most pronounced in lung, liver, and spleen.HS for 330, but not 150, min also caused hyporeactivity of rat aortic rings to vasoconstrictors, which was associated with induction of calcium-independent NOS activity in this tissue.Aortic hyporeactivity was prevented by dexamethasone pretreatment in vivo and reversed by NO2Arg in vitro.HS was not associated with an increase in plasma endotoxin levels, showing that endotoxin does not account for induction of NOS in this model.Thus, excessive NO formation induces vascular hyporeactivity and decompensation in HS, indicating that NOS inhibitors, particularly of the inducible NOS, may improve the therapeutic outcome of patients suffering from HS.
Mediators of vascular and parenchymal mechanisms in secondary brain damage.Several putative mediators of vasogenic brain edema will be considered with respect to the following criteria: 1) their effect on blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, 2) their vasomotor actions which may increase driving forces for transmural bulk flow, 3) their influence on edema formation, 4) their actual tissue concentration in pathological states, and 5) the therapeutic results after specific treatment.Bradykinin (BK) can induce brain edema by increasing BBB permeability to small solutes and enhancing blood pressure in the microcirculation due to arterial dilatation and venous constriction.Its interstitial concentration is enhanced after experimental trauma.Since kallikrein inhibitors reduce brain swelling all criteria favour BK as a mediator of vasogenic edema.Arachidonic acid (AA) opens BBB also for large tracers but exerts only small vasomotor effects.The edema formation is associated with an increase of the AA concentration in the interstitial space.However, convincing therapeutic results on inhibition of AA are still lacking.In addition to the formation of vasogenic edema AA has been found to induce cytotoxic edema.From experiments dealing with the vasomotor effects Ellis et al.(Am J Physiol 255: H397-H400, 1988) concluded an interaction of BK and AA in brain injury.However, our own results do not favour this hypothesis since we found divergent vasomotor and permeability effects of BK and AA.Histamine (HA) opens BBB unspecifically and dilates cerebral vessels, mechanisms by which edema formation can be explained.
Endogenous bradykinin activity in Dahl rats.We assessed the participation of endogenous bradykinin (BK) on basal blood pressure (BP) regulation in anesthetized Dahl-sensitive (DS) and Dahl-resistant (DR) rats receiving different NaCl diets.Four groups of Dahl rats were studied after 5 weeks of high (H) = 7% or low (L) = 0.4% NaCl diet (DSH, n = 9;DSL, n = 11;DRH, n = 9;DRL, n = 10).Endogenous BK activity was assessed with a continuous intraarterial (i.a.) infusion of the specific BK antagonist (B4146 100 micrograms/kg/min) for 10 min.Sensitivity to exogenous BK was tested 30 min after the end of the infusions, with bolus intraarterial (i.a.) injections of BK (0.1, 0.5, 1, and 5 micrograms).DSH had a significantly higher (p < 0.0001) basal mean BP (MBP) as compared with the three other groups: DSH = 185 +/- 7 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM), DSL = 143 +/- 5 mm Hg, DRH = 132 +/- 10 mm Hg, and DRL = 134 +/- 6 mm Hg.BK antagonist infusion increased MBP by 13.2 +/- 1.5 mm Hg in DSL rats, by 6.8 +/- 1.6 mm Hg in DRL, by 4.7 +/- 1.6 mm Hg in DRH, and by 1.1 +/- 8 mm Hg in DSH.Statistical analysis showed that the high NaCl diet significantly decreased the response to the BK antagonist in DS (p < 0.001) but not in DR rats.MBP response to exogenous BK was similar in all groups.These results show that endogenous BK has a vasodepressor effect on DS rats fed a low NaCl diet.This effect is suppressed after a high-salt diet.
Antihypertensive monotherapy and stress-induced changes in physiological activity.The effects of two types of laboratory stressors, a structured interview and the cold pressor test, on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were studied in normotensive individuals (n = 16), unmedicated hypertensive patients (n = 12), and medicated hypertensive patients (n = 46).Fifteen patients were in the bisoprolol group, 16 patients were in the enalapril group, and 15 patients were in the nitrendipine group.Concurrent physiologic measures, finger pulse volume (FPV), electrodermal activity, and respiratory frequency (RF), were also used to evaluate the level of stress reached by the subjects during and after the tasks.No significant differences were evident between the different treatments in BP and other physiologic responses to stressors.Patients receiving bisoprolol maintained lower HR and systolic BP values, but these differences were not related to the reaction to the stressors.No significant differences were noted in diastolic BP (DBP) between the different groups.The highest physiologic responses were obtained during the structured interview.Antihypertensive monotherapy does not attenuate cardiovascular reactions induced by acute stress in controlled laboratory conditions.In laboratory studies of the relationships between stress and hypertension, it is important that social stressors be used and that physiologic rather than cardiovascular measures of stress be recorded.
Effect of aging and drug-induced weight reduction on rat vascular reactivity.We determined the effects of D-fenfluramine treatment on the changes in vascular reactivity induced by aging.Nine- and 49-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats (a strain known to develop hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance during the aging process) were treated for 3 weeks either with D-fenfluramine 2.5 mg/kg twice daily orally or with vehicle.The rats were then exsanguinated and the abdominal aorta was carefully removed, cut into rings, and suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording.Control old rats (vehicle) had a significantly lower glucose infusion rate (an index of insulin resistance), and higher blood pressure (BP), glycemia, and insulinemia than young rats.The D-fenfluramine treatment in the aged animals produced a significant decrease in insulinemia and body weight.In aorta from the older treated and nontreated animals, the contraction to alpha-adrenergic stimulation and to the thromboxane analogue U46619 was significantly reduced as compared with that in young animals, but the response to KCl was unaffected.In contrast, in the old nontreated rats, the aorta was hyperresponsive to serotonin.D-Fenfluramine abolished this hyperreactivity.The response to beta-adrenergic stimulation and to forskolin was inhibited in the older animals but was not influenced by the treatment.Endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were not statistically different in the various groups, but the endothelium-dependent relaxation to ADP was reduced in the control group of older animals.D-Fenfluramine treatment restored the response to ADP.
Effects of high doses of A-74273, a novel nonpeptidic and orally bioavailable renin inhibitor.Previous studies with peptidic renin inhibitors have shown that high intravenous (i.v.) doses can induce unexpectedly large decreases in blood pressure (BP) that appear to be independent of plasma renin inhibition.A-74273 represents a new class of potent and orally bioavailable nonpeptidic renin inhibitors.We evaluated the BP effects of this renin inhibitor administered orally (p.o.) or i.v. at high doses to conscious salt-depleted dogs.Administration of A-74273 at 30 and 60 mg/kg p.o.(n = 6 per dose) produced similar maximum reductions in BP (-40 +/- 4 vs.-46 +/- 5 mm Hg) despite the occurrence of greater plasma drug concentrations at the higher dose.Duration of hypotension, however, was increased (p < 0.05) from 9 h at 30 mg/kg to 18 h at 60 mg/kg.The initial depressor response to 10 and 30 mg/kg i.v. doses of A-74273 (n = 6 per dose) was comparable, although duration and overall BP response was greater at 30 mg/kg i.v.No BP responses to A-74273 were noted in salt-replete dogs (n = 5).The hypotension produced by 30 mg/kg p.o.A-74273 was completely reversed by norepinephrine (NE 5 micrograms/kg/min;n = 5) or isotonic saline (4 ml/min/kg, n = 5) infusion.These studies demonstrate that high doses of A-74273 result in predictable BP responses that are renin-dependent and reversible.Therefore, large decreases in BP with high doses is not an attribute common to all renin inhibitors but appears to be a function of the structural characteristics specific to a particular compound.
GABA and bicuculline-induced blood pressure changes in spontaneously hypertensive rats.The brain GABAergic system was previously shown to influence blood pressure (BP) maintenance in rats which may in part be accomplished by disruption of the central renin-angiotensin system (RAS).We examined the potential role of GABA in sustaining the high BP exhibited by the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model of human essential hypertension.Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of GABA produced decreases in BP in members of three rat strains, including Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Sprague-Dawley normotensive controls and SHR.The SHR were significantly more sensitive to GABA than the normotensive strains.Next, the GABA receptor antagonist bicuculline (BMI) was infused i.c.v. and produced increases in BP in members of each strain.Finally, i.c.v. pretreatment with the specific angiotensin receptor antagonist [Sar1, Thr8]AII (sarthran), blocked subsequent GABA-induced decreases in BP in members of all three strains, and there was a trend toward sarthran attenuation of BMI-induced increases in BP.These results encourage the hypothesis that the hypotensive effects produced by central application of GABA are mediated by the brain angiotensin system.
Comparison of verapamil and captopril in elderly hypertensive subjects: results of a randomized, double-blind, crossover study.The effectiveness and tolerability of captopril and verapamil SR were compared in a double-blind, crossover study in 23 elderly hypertensives [15 males and 8 females, aged (mean +/- SEM) 68 +/- 1 years].After 2 weeks of placebo run-in, patients were randomized to a starting dose of captopril, 12.5 mg b.i.d. or verapamil SR, 120 mg q.d. plus matched placebo of the opposite drug.Medication was titrated up over 6 weeks to a maximum dose of 75 mg of captopril or 360 mg of verapamil SR to achieve a sitting diastolic blood pressure of < 90 mm Hg.After 2 weeks of placebo washout, captopril and verapamil were crossed over.In the 20 patients who completed the study, the dose at the end of the respective treatment periods averaged 63 +/- 4 mg of captopril and 270 +/- 21 mg of verapamil SR.Blood pressure at the end of the run-in and washout placebo periods were comparable: 164 +/- 4/97 +/- 1 and 163 +/- 4/98 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively.However, the blood pressure was significantly lower after verapamil, i.e., 147 +/- 4/86 +/- 2 mm Hg, than after captopril, i.e., 155 +/- 4/90 +/- 1 mm Hg (p < 0.05, ANOVA).There was no significant change in heart rate and laboratory parameters and no orthostatic hypotension.Captopril-treated patients reported a positive change in well being compared with placebo, although there was no overall difference between the drugs in any of the ten quality of life measurements.Three patients discontinued treatment, two because of constipation (verapamil) and one due to lack of efficacy (captopril).
Efficacy and tolerability of lovastatin in hypercholesterolemia in patients with systemic hypertension.A previously published study reported on an open-label, multicenter study of the efficacy and tolerability of lovastatin in the management of nonfamilial primary hypercholesterolemia.In the present report the results from the 213 hypercholesterolemic patients with systemic hypertension are presented.At baseline mean +/- SD of total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and the ratio of total serum cholesterol to HDL cholesterol were 268 +/- 24, 189 +/- 22 and 43 +/- 10 mg/dl and 6.6 +/- 1.6, respectively.Of the 213 hypertensive patients only 24 were not receiving antihypertensive or related cardiac medication.Baseline mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 140 +/- 20 and 84 +/- 9 mm Hg, respectively.Within 1 month of lovastatin therapy the observed significant reductions in total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol were 19, 27 and 24%, respectively.HDL cholesterol was increased by 6%.Diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly during this 1-month period.The 1-month lipid results were maintained over the full 6 months of the study.The dosage of lovastatin was 20 mg/day for the first month of therapy and could subsequently be adjusted to response, up to a maximum of 80 mg/day.Again, without changes in diastolic blood pressure, lovastatin was generally effective in improving the serum lipids of hypercholesterolemic hypertensive patients regardless of the type of antihypertensive medications received (including diuretics and beta blockers).Lovastatin was generally well tolerated.
Linkage of Agt and Actsk-1 to distal mouse chromosome 8 loci: a new conserved linkage.Angiotensinogen is an alpha 2-globulin involved in the maintenance of blood pressure and electrolyte balance.We have refined the position of the mouse angiotensinogen locus (Agt) on Chromosome (Chr) 8 and have also confirmed the assignment of the human angiotensinogen locus (AGT) to Chr 1.The segregation of several restriction fragment length variants (RFLVs) was followed in two interspecific backcross sets and in four recombinant inbred (RI) mouse sets.Analysis of the segregation patterns closely linked Agt to Aprt and Emv-2, which places the angiotensinogen locus on the distal end of mouse Chr 8.Additionally, a literature search has revealed that the strain distribution pattern (SDP) for the mouse skeletal alpha-actin locus 1 (Actsk-1, previously Acta1, Acta, or Acts) is nearly identical to the SDP for Agt in two RI sets.On the basis of this information we were able to reassign Actsk-1 to mouse Chr 8.By screening a panel of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids, we confirmed that the human angiotensinogen locus lies on Chr 1.This information describes a new region of conserved linkage homology between mouse Chr 8 and human Chr 1.It also defines the end of a large region of conserved linkage homology between mouse Chr 8 and human Chr 16.
Differences in the acute and chronic antihypertensive mechanism of action of ketanserin in spontaneously hypertensive rats.The antihypertensive mode of action of the 5HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin (KET), is still a subject of controversy and has been evaluated predominantly in acute studies.Acute i.v. administration of KET (3.0 or 6.0 mg/kg) in spontaneously hypertensive rats resulted in dose-dependent reductions in mean arterial pressure accompanied by concomitant bradycardia.In these studies, the responses to single i.v. doses of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (10.0 micrograms/kg) and to the 5HT2 receptor agonist alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (125.0 micrograms/kg) 30 min after injection of KET were blocked.In spontaneously hypertensive rats treated with KET infusions (3.0 mg/kg/day i.v., n = 9, or 6.0 mg/kg/day i.v., n = 8) for 7 days via osmotic minipumps, significant dose-dependent falls in systolic blood pressure were observed during the period of infusion.Heart rate did not change over the period of observation in both vehicle- and KET-treated groups.On day 7 of infusion, KET dose-dependently reduced responses to the 5HT2 agonist alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (5.0-125.0 micrograms/kg i.v.) but did not affect responses to phenylephrine (1.0-10.0 micrograms/kg i.v.).Baroreflex sensitivity on day 7 was significantly greater in KET-infused rats as compared with control rats.These data confirm that the acute antihypertensive effects of KET are due to a combination of alpha-1 and 5HT2 receptor blockade.During chronic administration, however, the alpha-1 blocking effects of KET are compensated for, and the reduction in blood pressure by day 7 of KET chronic administration is maintained predominantly by persistent blockade of 5HT2 receptors.
CIS-19, a novel platelet activating factor receptor antagonist: in vitro and in vivo studies.The effects of CIS-19 (cis-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-6-isopropoxy-7-methoxyl-1-(N-methylforma mido)-1,2, 3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene) was determined in vitro in rabbit platelets and in vivo in rats and guinea-pigs.CIS-19 inhibited in a selective and concentration-dependent manner the aggregation and ATP release reaction of rabbit platelets induced by PAF (4 nM).The IC50 values of CIS-19 on PAF-induced aggregation of washed platelets and platelet-rich plasma were 11.3 +/- 2.7 and 16.8 +/- 3.0 microM respectively.BN52021 also inhibited PAF-induced aggregation of washed platelets with an IC50 value of 11.7 +/- 2.8 microM.CIS-19 inhibited [3H]PAF (4 nM) binding to washed rabbit platelets with an IC50 value of 1.5 +/- 0.2 microM.The concentration-response curve of PAF-induced aggregation of washed platelets was shifted rightwards by CIS-19 with pA2 and pA10 values of 7.1 (6.8-7.3 for 95% confidence limit) and 6.1 (5.8-6.2) respectively.The thromboxane B2 formation of washed platelets caused by AA, collagen or thrombin was not affected by CIS-19 of concentrations below 400 microM.CIS-19 (25 microM) completely blocked PAF-induced, but not collagen- or thrombin-induced [3H]inositol monophosphate formation of washed platelets.When CIS-19 (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) was injected i.v. into the femoral vein, it did not affect the blood pressure of rats, but antagonized PAF (2.5 micrograms/kg, i.v.)-induced hypotensive shock either preventively or curatively.CIS-19 (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) also blocked PAF (50 ng/kg)-induced, but not AA (50 micrograms/kg)-induced, bronchoconstriction in guinea-pigs.It is concluded that CIS-19 is an effective PAF receptor antagonist not only in vitro, but also in vivo.
Feedback regulation of angiotensin converting enzyme activity and mRNA levels by angiotensin II.Although renin and angiotensinogen are known to be subject to feedback regulation, the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) on the regulation of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene expression and enzymatic activity have not yet been studied.Therefore, the effects of exogenous Ang II infusion and ACE inhibition on ACE mRNA expression were examined.Ang II was infused intravenously in male Sprague-Dawley rats for 3 days at 100 (low dose), 300 (medium dose), or 1,000 (high dose) ng/kg per minute (n = 8 for each group).Compared with control (vehicle infusion, n = 8), Ang II infusion increased plasma Ang II concentration (62, 101, 126 [p < 0.05], and 187 [p < 0.05] fmol/ml) and mean arterial blood pressure (106, 119 [p < 0.05], 134 [p < 0.05], and 125 mm Hg for control, low, medium, and high doses, respectively).Ang II infusion decreased ACE mRNA levels in the lung (57%, 52%, and 51%;p < 0.05 for each) and testis (49%, 63%, and 53% of control for low, medium, and high doses, respectively;p < 0.05 for each), two major sites of ACE synthesis.There was, albeit less pronounced, a parallel decrease in pulmonary ACE activity (4.38, 3.92, 3.07 [p < 0.05], and 3.48 [p < 0.05] nM/mg per minute for control, medium, and high doses, respectively).In contrast, serum (54, 50, 48, and 38 [p < 0.05] nM/ml per minute) and testicular (2.63, 2.08 [p < 0.05], 2.24, and 2.18 nM/mg per minute for control, low, medium, and high doses, respectively) ACE activities displayed only minimal change in animals infused with Ang II.
Renal, endocrine, and hemodynamic effects of human brain natriuretic peptide in normal man.Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) is a recently identified hormone which is secreted by the human heart and circulates in plasma.To determine the effects of pathophysiological levels of human BNP (hBNP), we have studied the integrated renal, hormonal, and hemodynamic response in six normal men receiving 2-h infusions of synthetic hBNP (2.0 pmol/kg.min) or placebo in random order.Steady state levels of hBNP (20-30 pmol/L), achieved at 90-120 min, were similar to levels observed in mild heart failure.Compared to placebo infusions, hBNP induced a greater than 2-fold increase in sodium excretion (P = 0.014) and suppressed plasma aldosterone (P < 0.004) to levels less than 50% of placebo values.These changes were associated with an increase in both plasma (P = 0.028) and urine excretion (P < 0.004) of cGMP.Effects on blood pressure were not statistically significant but increases in both heart rate (P < 0.0001) and plasma albumin (P = 0.007) after cessation of hBNP infusions indicate significant hemodynamic effects of hBNP.High MCR (5.8 +/- 0.7 L/min) yet slow disappearance rate (mean t1/2 22.6 min) indicate that hBNP has a large volume of distribution in humans.These studies show that hBNP, at plasma levels observed in patients with mild heart failure, has potentially important natriuretic, endocrine, and hemodynamic effects which are similar to those observed with comparable infusion rates of ANF.
Role of endogenous atrial natriuretic peptide in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats.Effects of a novel nonpeptide antagonist for atrial natriuretic peptide receptor.BACKGROUND.To explore roles of endogenous atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in blood pressure and volume regulation, we examined the effects of a newly developed ANP antagonist, HS-142-1 (HS) in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats.METHODS AND RESULTS.We examined 1) the effects of HS on ANP- or brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)-induced reductions in renal vascular resistance (RVR) of rat isolated perfused kidneys, 2) the effects of HS on cyclic GMP (cGMP) production in rat cultured vascular smooth muscle cells pretreated with ANP or BNP, and 3) the renal and systemic effects of HS in DOCA-salt-treated rats and control rats.We found that 1) HS dose-dependently reversed ANP- or BNP-induced decreases in RVR;2) ANP or BNP at 100 nM caused an eightfold increase in cGMP production.These increases in cGMP were inhibited by HS in a dose-dependent fashion, and 300 micrograms/ml HS decreased cGMP to the control level.HS alone did not influence RVR or cGMP production;and 3) DOCA-salt rats showed higher plasma concentrations of ANP (198 versus 75 pg/ml) and BNP (23.7 versus 2.7 pg/ml, each p < 0.01) than the control rats.Bolus administration of 8 mg/kg HS elevated blood pressure by 8% (p < 0.01).This rise in blood pressure was attributed to an increase in systemic vascular resistance (+14%, p < 0.05).Conversely, urinary excretion of sodium (-41%), glomerular filtration rate (-27%), and plasma (-77%) and urinary cGMP (-69%, each p < 0.01) were decreased by administration of 8 mg/kg HS.These effects were dose dependent in DOCA-salt rats but slight or negligible in the control rats.CONCLUSIONS.These results suggest that endogenous ANP and BNP may be involved in the regulation of blood pressure and body fluid volume in DOCA-salt rats in which ANP and BNP secretion is augmented.
Pregnancy in women with end-stage renal disease: treatment of anemia and premature labor.There is little experience with the use of various therapies in the end-stage renal disease patient who becomes pregnant.Erythropoietin for the treatment of anemia has become part of the standard treatment regimen of dialysis patients, but experience with its use in pregnancy is limited.We report five cases of its use in dialysis patients during pregnancy.We found no evidence that it crossed the placenta or that it made blood pressure control more difficult.We found that patients required a higher dose of erythropoietin to maintain hematocrit levels than they had before pregnancy.Another therapy involves the treatment for premature labor, which is the most common cause of pregnancy loss in dialysis patients.Two of our patients were successfully treated with indomethacin for premature labor.Both drugs are useful tools in the management of pregnant dialysis patients.
Propofol anesthesia reduces emesis and airway obstruction in pediatric outpatients.This study was an authors comparison of the effects of and recovery from anesthesia in healthy, premedicated pediatric outpatients who received either inhaled anesthetics (group 1) or propofol (group 2).Group 1 (n = 68) averaged 3.8 +/- 0.2 yr and weighed 17.7 +/- 0.8 kg, whereas group 2 (n = 75) averaged 3.3 +/- 0.2 yr and weighed 16.3 +/- 0.6 kg.The incidence of vomiting in the Postanesthetic Care Unit (PACU) and from discharge to the first postoperative morning was lower in the group receiving propofol (0% and 18%) than in the group receiving volatile agents (7% and 34%, P < 0.05).The incidence of airway obstruction during induction of anesthesia was higher (34% vs 10%, P < 0.01) in children receiving inhaled agent.Withdrawal of the extremity with propofol injection occurred in 14 (19%) patients.Arterial blood pressure was higher at loss of consciousness, laryngoscopy, and tracheal intubation in group 2 (P < 0.01).The length of time from the end of surgery to extubation of the trachea, recovery scores, and length of time spent in the PACU and the Day Surgery Unit were the same in the two groups.Pain scores obtained in the PACU were not different.The data indicate that propofol can be used safely to induce and maintain anesthesia in healthy pediatric outpatients.This coupled with the low incidence of vomiting and airway obstruction in the propofol group suggests distinct and compelling reasons to consider using the drug in this patient population.
Intravenous isoproterenol as a marker for epidural test-dosing in children.The purpose of this study was to determine if isoproterenol would be an effective marker of intravascular injection in anesthetized children.Forty-four ASA 1 children, aged 2 mo to 10 yr, were randomly assigned to two groups.Children in group 1 (n = 21) received 0.05 microgram/kg isoproterenol, and children in group 2 (n = 23) received 0.075 microgram/kg isoproterenol.A blinded observer continuously recorded heart rate and arterial blood pressure.Measurements were recorded before the surgical incision at steady-state halothane concentration of 1.2 minimum alveolar concentration adjusted for age.Isoproterenol produced a graded increase in heart rate with mean maximum increases of 16.5 +/- 8.7 beats/min in group 1 and 21.5 +/- 9.2 beats/min in group 2.No episodes of hypotension and arrhythmia were noted.Isoproterenol, 0.075 microgram/kg, is more sensitive but still is an imperfect marker of an intravascular injection.It produces a heart rate increase in 96% of children anesthetized with halothane and nitrous oxide in 50% oxygen.The application of isoproterenol as an epidural test dose appears promising, but cannot be recommended until its full reliability and neurotoxicity are evaluated.
Modulation of macrophage membrane phospholipids by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids increases interleukin 1 release and prevents suppression of cellular immunity following hemorrhagic shock.Studies have suggested that the significant suppression of cellular immunity following hemorrhage may be due to an increased release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by macrophages.Since diets high in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids decrease PGE2 synthesis, we assessed whether hemorrhage-induced immunosuppression could be prevented by dietary manipulation.C3H/HeN mice were fed for 3 weeks with fat sources derived from corn oil, safflower oil, or fish oil, then bled to a mean blood pressure of 35 mm Hg maintained for 60 minutes.Following this, the animals were adequately resuscitated with fluids and killed 24 hours later.In the corn oil and safflower oil groups, hemorrhage resulted in a significant increase in PGE2 release by peritoneal macrophages, a marked suppression of peritoneal macrophage antigen presentation capacity, interleukin 1 release, splenocyte proliferation, and interleukin 2 secretion compared with shams.However, feeding mice with fish oil for 3 weeks prior to hemorrhage prevented the rise in PGE2 release and maintained normal macrophage and splenocyte functions following hemorrhage.Thus, the elevated release of PGE2 by peritoneal macrophages plays a pivotal role in hemorrhage-induced immunosuppression.Moreover, diets high in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may offer a new therapeutic approach for preventing posthemorrhage immunosuppression and increased mortality from sepsis.
Respiratory modulation of muscle sympathetic nerve activity in intact and lung denervated humans.We determined the influences of breathing-induced changes in intrathoracic and intravascular pressures, central respiratory drive, and pulmonary vagal feedback on the within-breath variation in skeletal muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in humans.MSNA (peroneal microneurography), arterial blood pressure (Finapres finger monitor), and tidal volume (VT) were recorded continuously in six normal subjects and four heart-lung transplant patients during: 1) spontaneous air breathing;2) increased FICO2;3) voluntary augmentation of VT with and without inspiratory resistance;and 4) positive pressure, passive mechanical ventilation.During conditions 3 and 4, which were performed under isocapnic conditions with a high MSNA background (either high resting activity or nonhypotensive lower body suction), subjects breathed at control or elevated VT with normal or prolonged inspiratory time (TI);breathing frequency was 12 breaths per minute.During control breathing in normal subjects there was a distinct within-breath pattern of MSNA, with approximately 70% of the activity occurring during low lung volumes (initial half of inspiration and latter half of expiration).This within-breath variation of MSNA was potentiated with increased VT breathing (> 85% of activity occurring during low lung volumes;p < 0.05 versus control breathing) and was similar during the voluntary and CO2-induced hyperpneas.MSNA decreased progressively and markedly from onset to late inspiration;fell slightly further, reaching its nadir at end-inspiration/onset-expiration;and rose sharply during mid-late expiration.Only the nadir of MSNA was associated with any change in arterial pressure.Resistive breathing, especially at elevated VT, caused a fall in arterial pressure and increased respiratory drive during inspiration, yet MSNA still declined as lung volume increased.Normal within-breath modulation of MSNA also was observed during control and elevated VT induced via positive pressure with passive ventilation, which reversed lung inflation/deflation-induced intrathoracic pressure changes and reduced or removed respiratory motor output.During control breathing in transplant patients the specific within-breath pattern of MSNA was somewhat different than that of the normal subjects, but on average, the overall low lung volume to high lung volume MSNA ratio was similar to normal subjects.In contrast to the normal subjects, however, there was no potentiation of the within-breath variation of MSNA with elevated tidal breathing.These findings indicate that during normal levels of tidal breathing most of the respiratory phase influence on muscle sympathetic outflow observed in normal conscious humans is independent of baroreceptor-sensed fluctuations in intrathoracic or intravascular pressures and of lung inflation-stimulated vagal afferent activity.
Beneficial effects of atrial natriuretic peptide on exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with stable effort angina pectoris.BACKGROUND.It has been shown that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), an endogenous vasodilator, dilates coronary arteries and decreases coronary vascular resistance.The purpose of this study was to determine whether an intravenous administration of ANP attenuated exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in 14 patients with stable effort angina pectoris.METHODS AND RESULTS.The first 12 patients (patients 1-12) who had exercise-induced ST segment depression underwent treadmill exercise testing and the last seven patients (patients 8-14) underwent the exercise 201Tl-single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) study while synthetic 28-amino acid alpha-human ANP (0.1 micrograms/kg per minute) or saline was intravenously infused in a double-blind, cross-over manner.The duration of exercise testing was the same during ANP and saline infusion, which was determined in preliminary exercise testings in each patient to cause a transient perfusion defect and/or ischemic ST segment depression.During saline infusion, all 12 patients developed exercise-induced ischemic ST segment depression, whereas no significant ST segment depression appeared during ANP infusion.Average ST segment depression during ANP infusion was significantly less (p < 0.01) than that during saline infusion (0.0 +/- 0.0 versus 0.2 +/- 0.1 mV, mean +/- SD).The averaged extent and severity scores assessed by 201Tl-SPECT were smaller (p < 0.05) during ANP infusion than during saline infusion (extent score: 0.22 +/- 0.20 versus 0.42 +/- 0.20;severity score: 18.77 +/- 23.45 versus 38.24 +/- 24.04, respectively).ANP decreased resting systolic blood pressure from 125 +/- 15 to 110 +/- 15 mm Hg (p < 0.01) but did not alter resting heart rate.At peak exercise, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and the rate-pressure products did not differ during ANP and saline infusion.At peak exercise, plasma ANP increased from 98 +/- 45 to 4,383 +/- 2,782 pg/ml and cGMP increased from 3.6 +/- 1.7 to 34.5 +/- 16.1 pmol/ml during ANP infusion;values were significantly higher than those during saline infusion (from 96 +/- 42 to 133 +/- 66 pg/ml and from 3.4 +/- 1.8 to 4.6 +/- 1.8 pmol/ml, respectively).CONCLUSIONS.An intravenous administration of ANP attenuated exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with stable effort angina pectoris.Although the mechanism by which ANP attenuated myocardial ischemia was not defined, increased myocardial perfusion to the ischemic region might be an important factor.
Long-term effects of transdermal estradiol with and without medroxyprogesterone acetate.OBJECTIVE: To study the long-term biological and metabolical effects of estradiol (E2) administered by transdermal therapeutic systems with and without the addition of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA).DESIGN: Open, randomized, comparative trial.SETTING: The reproductive endocrine unit of a tertiary care university-affiliated hospital.PATIENTS: Fifty-seven postmenopausal women were given E2 transdermally, whereas 28 were randomized to take MPA by mouth.Fifteen premenopausal women were studied for comparison.INTERVENTIONS: Estradiol, 0.1 mg, was administered by a transdermal therapeutic system for 24.5 of 28 days and was cycled for 96 weeks.Medroxyprogesterone acetate, 10 mg, was given for days 13 to 25 of each 28-day cycle (E+P group), whereas the remainder received E2 only.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum E2, estrone (E1), luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, low-density, high-density, very low-density, and total cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, renin substrate, plasma renin activity, and serum aldosterone levels were measured in all subjects at baseline and in the postmenopausal women every 24 weeks until the end of study.RESULTS: Mean +/- SE levels of E2 rose significantly from baseline at 24 weeks to 426 and 355 pmol/L for the E only and E+P groups, respectively.Smaller increases of estrone (E1) were observed to 263 and 244 pmol/L for the same respective groups.As expected, baseline levels of both gonadotropins were elevated, fell significantly with E2 administration, but remained increased in comparison with values observed in younger women.Decreases of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were observed in both groups that reached statistical significance at 48 weeks or later with the exception of LDL cholesterol in the E only group.No significant change of high-density lipoprotein or very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides was observed.There were reductions of mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures in both groups that reached significance at 72 weeks.Mean baseline plasma renin substrate, plasma renin activity, and serum aldosterone levels were within the ranges observed in younger, healthy women and did not change significantly with E2 administration in either group.CONCLUSION: These data support the long-term efficacy and safety of this form of replacement therapy, particularly in combination with MPA, in women with a uterus.
Antihypertensive drug therapy and coronary heart disease risk.Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the major cause of death in the United States.Major modifiable risk factors for CHD are hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and cigarette smoking, with concomitant risk factors, especially left ventricular hypertrophy, that act synergistically to significantly increase overall risk.Antihypertensive therapy, while reducing the incidence of stroke, has not consistently reduced the incidence of CHD.This may be a result, in part, of adverse effects on the metabolic profile, especially on blood lipids, which are induced by diuretics and certain beta-blockers.Other antihypertensive agents appear to be either lipid neutral, such as calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or lipid positive, such as selective alpha 1-blockers.The choice of initial antihypertensive therapy should be made with all of a patient's risk factors in mind.In addition to the drugs recommended in the 1988 Guidelines of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, selective alpha 1-blockers should also be considered since they improve the lipid profile as well as reduce blood pressure.
Efficacy of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for neonates with respiratory and circulatory compromise.We report a 12-month experience at Egleston Children's Hospital in Atlanta, Ga., with a protocol under which venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used instead of venoarterial ECMO.Fifty-five newborn infants were referred for ECMO, four of whom had disqualifying conditions (all four died).Thirty-one infants were supported without recourse to ECMO, one of whom died.Of the 20 remaining patients, three were placed on a venoarterial ECMO regimen because of our early uncertainty about the efficacy of venovenous ECMO or because of technical constraints.All other patients (n = 17), including three with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, were supported with venovenous perfusion.No patient begun on a venovenous ECMO regimen required conversion to venoarterial bypass.Before ECMO, venovenous patients required an average dopamine dose of 16 micrograms/kg per minute and an average dobutamine dose of 6 micrograms/kg per minute.Of 15 patients studied before ECMO, three had significantly impaired contractility, and all had evidence of pulmonary hypertension on an echocardiogram.Mean blood pressure did not change while heart rate fell from 172 to 146 beats/min during the first 2 hours of ECMO and vasoactive drug doses were reduced.Of the 17 venovenous ECMO patients, 15 (88%) survived.We conclude that neonatal patients with severe hypoxia and substantial circulatory compromise can be effectively supported by venovenous ECMO in most cases.
A prospective study of blood pressure and serum creatinine.Results from the 'Clue' Study and the ARIC Study.OBJECTIVES--To describe associations of past and current blood pressure levels with serum creatinine levels and hypercreatinemia in the general population.POPULATION--1399 middle-aged residents of Washington County, Maryland, who had their blood pressure measured during a cancer screening campaign in 1974 (the DESIGN--Nonconcurrent prospective study.The outcome variables were serum creatinine level and hypercreatinemia (serum creatinine > 115 mumol/L in men, > 97 mumol/L in women) measured from 1986 through 1989.Main predictors were 1986-1989 blood pressure values (cross-sectional association) and 1974 blood pressure values (longitudinal association).Gender-adjusted associations were assessed and compared by linear and logistic regression.RESULTS--Both serum creatinine and hypercreatinemia were better predicted by past than by current blood pressure values.Creatinine values exhibited a gradual and statistically significant association with blood pressure levels measured in 1974, even across The association with 1986-1989 blood pressure measurements was weaker and nonsignificant.The odds of hypercreatinemia in 1986-1989 were increased 1.5-fold to twofold, with a 20 mm Hg increment in 1974 blood pressure values, but the odds remained constant across 1986-1989 blood pressure values.CONCLUSIONS--Blood pressure and creatinine level are associated in the general population.The observed association was stronger when a number of years had elapsed between the assessments of blood pressure and creatinine level.These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that blood pressure elevations, even below the hypertensive range, may induce early renal damage.
Management of intracranial hypertension.Intracranial hypertension is the final common denominator of morbidity and mortality for diverse neurologic problems, and its proper treatment requires the heuristic application of the available therapeutic alternatives when the clinical situation and patient's prognosis warrants treatment.The initial therapeutic focus for ICP reduction should be control of factors that may aggravate intracranial hypertension such as inappropriate head and body position, elevated body temperature, pain, noxious stimuli, elevated airway pressure, elevated blood pressure, seizures, and hypotonic intravenous fluids.The appropriate conventional therapies (e.g., hyperventilation, osmotic agents, sedatives, barbiturates, and cerebrospinal fluid removal) should be selected based on the details of each individual case.Surgical removal of intracranial mass lesions may be indicated in some circumstances, particularly for intractable intracranial hypertension and progressive, severe brain tissue shifts.
Prediction of pregnancy-induced hypertension by means of the urinary calcium:creatinine ratio.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the importance of the urinary calcium:creatinine ratio as a prognostic marker for pregnancy-induced hypertension.DESIGN: A prospective study which measured the urinary calcium:creatinine ratio at 20-30 weeks' gestation.Patients' medical records were examined, blind to all urinary assay results, to determine the development of pre-eclampsia or gestational hypertension.SETTING AND SUBJECTS: A first-morning urine sample was collected from 456 normotensive pregnant women, at 20-30 weeks' gestation, attending a hospital maternity outpatients' clinic for routine antenatal care.RESULTS: The mean urinary calcium:creatinine ratio for women (n = 392) with a normotensive outcome of pregnancy, 0.52 (SD 0.32), was not significantly different from the ratios in those women who developed pre-eclampsia (n = 16), 0.49 (SD 0.32) or gestational hypertension (n = 48), 0.57 (SD 0.41).Significant risk factors for development of gestational hypertension, as estimated by logistic regression, were mean arterial blood pressure greater than 87.6 mmHg, Caucasian race, non-smoking and nulliparity.CONCLUSIONS: Within the cohort studied, the calcium:creatinine ratio measured in asymptomatic women at 20-30 weeks' gestation was an unsatisfactory prognostic marker for development of pregnancy-induced hypertension.The major interpopulation, as well as intrapopulation, variation in calcium levels suggests that previous reported findings may not be readily generalised.
Sympathetic-nerve activity during sleep in normal subjects.BACKGROUND.The early hours of the morning after awakening are associated with an increased frequency of events such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.The triggering mechanisms for these events are not clear.We investigated whether autonomic changes occurring during sleep, particularly rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, contribute to the initiation of such events.METHODS.We measured blood pressure, heart rate, and sympathetic-nerve activity (using microneurography, which provides direct measurements of efferent sympathetic-nerve activity related to muscle blood vessels) in eight normal subjects while they were awake and while in the five stages of sleep.RESULTS.The mean (+/- SE) amplitude of bursts of sympathetic-nerve activity and levels of blood pressure and heart rate declined significantly (P < 0.001), from 100 +/- 9 percent, 90 +/- 4 mm Hg, and 64 +/- 2 beats per minute, respectively, during wakefulness to 41 +/- 9 percent, 80 +/- 4 mm Hg, and 59 +/- 2 beats per minute, respectively, during stage 4 of non-REM sleep.Arousal stimuli during stage 2 sleep elicited high-amplitude deflections on the electroencephalogram (called K complexes), which were frequently associated with bursts of sympathetic-nerve activity and transient increases in blood pressure.During REM sleep, sympathetic-nerve activity increased significantly (to 215 +/- 11 percent;P < 0.001) and the blood pressure and heart rate returned to levels similar to those during wakefulness.Momentary restorations of muscle tone during REM sleep (REM twitches) were associated with cessation of sympathetic-nerve discharge and surges in blood pressure.CONCLUSIONS.REM sleep is associated with profound sympathetic activation in normal subjects, possibly linked to changes in muscle tone.The hemodynamic and sympathetic changes during REM sleep could play a part in triggering ischemic events in patients with vascular disease.
Is the hydrogen clearance technique a useful tool for measurements of pancreatic blood flow during acute experimental pancreatitis?Changes of pancreatic blood flow (PBF) during acute pancreatitis (AP) have been under investigation by means of electromagnetic flowmeters, radioactive microspheres, isotope fractionation, radioactive gas clearance, and venous outflow techniques.All methods, however, have certain drawbacks, which make the application of other techniques desirable.In this study, the hydrogen clearance technique (HCT) was tested for the first time in a well-established foxhound model of AP.PBF, systemic blood pressure, and heart rate were monitored over 90 min after the onset of AP and 60 min after therapeutic infusion of Dextran-40 (10 ml/kg body wt).Our results fully agree with the data found by other techniques in this experimental model.Sixty-five of 73 electrodes implanted into the pancreas of eight foxhounds were found working.From 1,024 registered clearance curves, 876 were identified as monoexponential.In the other cases, and only then, we found either dislocation of the electrode tips (n = 6) or perielectrodal hemorrhage during histological examination (n = 4).We believe that the HCT is a feasible and reliable tool for measuring PBF in experimental settings like AP.
Impaired immediate vasoconstrictor responses in patients with recurrent neurally mediated syncope.Immediate responses to head-up tilt were determined in 78 consecutive patients with unexplained syncope undergoing 45-minute tilt tests at 60 degrees.Thirty-four patients developed neurally mediated syncope (mean time to syncope 18 minutes), 40 tolerated the full duration of tilt, and 4 were unable to complete the study but did not develop syncope.Blood pressure, heart rate, forearm blood flow and forearm vascular resistance were measured at baseline and after 2 and 5 minutes of tilt.Syncopal and nonsyncopal patients were well-matched for age and baseline hemodynamic parameters.There was no difference between the groups in heart rate or blood pressure at 2 minutes, but there was a small but significant difference in percent reduction in mean arterial pressure at 5 minutes.After 2 and 5 minutes of tilt, mean forearm blood flow was 2.4 and 2.6 ml/min/100 ml, respectively, in syncopal patients compared with 1.6 (p < 0.05) and 1.7 ml/min/100 ml (p < 0.01), respectively, in patients who tolerated 45 minutes of tilt.In syncopal patients, forearm vascular resistance was 51.0 and 44.0 at 2 and 5 minutes, respectively, whereas in nonsyncopal patients, it was 82.4 (p < 0.02) and 73.1 (p < 0.001), respectively.These differences remained consistent when only data for patients developing syncope after > 15 minutes were included in the analysis.Patients with neurally mediated syncope have clearly demonstrable abnormalities in vascular control immediately after assumption of the upright posture.The results shed new light on the pathophysiology of neurally mediated syncope.
Effect of exercise training on left ventricular performance in older women free of cardiopulmonary disease.Endurance exercise training increases aerobic exercise capacity (maximal oxygen consumption rate [VO2max]) and attenuates the age-related decline in left ventricular (LV) function during exercise in older men.To determine whether similar adaptations occur in older women, 10 subjects (aged 63 +/- 4 years mean +/- SE) were studied before and after 9 to 12 months of endurance exercise training.They exercised 3.85 +/- 0.06 days/week at 81 +/- 0.3% of maximal heart rate.LV function at rest and during supine exercise was assessed by radionuclide ventriculography.VO2max was increased by 21% (from 1.40 +/- 0.1 to 1.7 +/- 0.1 liter/min;p < 0.001) in response to training.Maximal heart rate and systolic blood pressure during treadmill exercise were unchanged (161 +/- 5 beats/min before vs 164 +/- 3 beats/min after;p = NS, and 208 +/- 7 mm Hg before vs 214 +/- 8 mm Hg after;p = NS, respectively) after training.LV ejection fraction at rest (70.4 +/- 2% before vs 70 +/- 1% after) and during peak exercise (78.6 +/- 2% before vs 79.3 +/- 2% after) did not change in response to training.Furthermore, the increases in ejection fraction from rest to exercise were similar before and after training (change: 8.8 +/- 1 vs 9.1 +/- 1%).Stroke volume and cardiac output at peak exercise also did not change in response to training.
The relationship between stress and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux: the influence of psychological factors.This paper describes the first controlled study of the relationships among stress, psychological traits associated with chronic anxiety, acid reflux parameters, and perceptions of reflux symptoms.Seventeen subjects with symptomatic reflux disease were studied using a 2 (high vs. low gastrointestinal susceptibility score) x 2 (stress vs. neutral tasks) x 3 (periods 1, 2, or 3) experimental design.It was found that the stress tasks produced significant increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rates, and subjective ratings of anxiety and reflux symptoms.The stress tasks, however, did not influence objective parameters of acid reflux (total acid exposure, number of reflux episodes, duration of longest reflux episode).Moreover, the effect of stress on reflux ratings was due primarily to the responses of the subjects with high gastrointestinal susceptibility scale scores.These subjects' reflux ratings remained at high levels during all stress periods, whereas subjects in all other experimental conditions reported decreased reflux symptoms across periods.These results suggest that reflux patients who are chronically anxious and exposed to prolonged stress may perceive low intensity esophageal stimuli as painful reflux symptoms.Future effort should be devoted to examining the efficacy of anxiolytic and behavioral therapies with these reflux patients.
Genetics of essential hypertension.Blood pressure is a complex quantitative trait that is determined by multiple environmental and genetic factors.Although some simple Mendelian forms of high blood pressure have been described, essential hypertension is characterized by a complex mode of inheritance.Based on recent advances in molecular biology and statistical genetics, it has become feasible to search for chromosome regions that may contain genes contributing to the pathogenesis of hypertension in humans.For example, recent linkage and association studies have raised the possibility that a blood pressure regulatory locus may exist in or near the angiotensinogen gene on chromosome 1.Detailed genetic experiments in animal models of hypertension may help to guide further clinical studies and lead to an improved understanding of gene action in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension.
Effects of methyldopa on uteroplacental and fetal hemodynamics in pregnancy-induced hypertension.OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to study the effect of methyldopa on uteroplacental and fetal hemodynamics in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension.STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study of Doppler ultrasonographic blood flow data before and after 1 week of methyldopa treatment was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National University Hospital, Singapore, in 20 women (mean 35 weeks' gestation) with pregnancy-induced hypertension.The main outcome measures were maternal blood pressure, maternal and fetal heart rate, and blood velocity waveforms characterized by the pulsatility index in the fetal ascending aorta, middle cerebral artery, umbilical artery, and maternal uterine and arcuate arteries.Statistical evaluation was performed with t tests for paired observations.RESULTS: Maternal mean arterial blood pressure was reduced 9.7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval -13.8 to -5.6), and mean heart rate decreased 6.3 beats/min (95% confidence interval -11.1 to -1.4).Mean pulsatility index in the uterine (0.93 to 0.92) and arcuate arteries (0.61 to 0.73) were unchanged after treatment.Fetal hemodynamic changes before and after treatment were not significant.Fetal and neonatal outcome was uneventful.CONCLUSION: Short-term treatment with methyldopa in the last trimester in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension reduced maternal blood pressure and heart rate but had no adverse effects on uteroplacental and fetal hemodynamics.
Decrease of central dopamine level in the adult spontaneously hypertensive rats related to the calcium metabolism disorder.The metabolism of calcium and brain dopamine in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) after the development of hypertension was investigated as a possible model for the hypertension mechanism.Serum calcium level in SHR was lower than that in the normotensive control.Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY, the parent strain of SHR).Conversely, bone calcification of SHR was higher than that in WKY.Possible mechanisms for the lower serum calcium level seen in SHR include a decrease in the availability of calcium from bone.The immunohistochemical dopamine levels in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens in SHR were lower than those in WKY.In these regions, the dopamine level was increased by the intraventricular administration of CaCl2 through a central, calmodulin-dependent system.This study suggests, based upon previous pharmacological studies, that the decrease of the serum calcium level in SHR causes a decrease in central, calcium-calmodulin-dependent dopamine synthesis and a subsequent low level of dopamine in the brain that produces an increase in blood pressure through functions of cerebral dopaminergic neurons and peripheral sympathetic nerves.Our results suggest that this could be one of the mechanisms of hypertension in SHR.
Functional evidence that the angiotensin antagonist losartan crosses the blood-brain barrier in the rat.Losartan is a novel nonpeptidergic antagonist of angiotensin (ANG) II subtype 1 (AT1) receptors, which effectively lowers blood pressure in high-renin hypertensive rat and blocks the pressor response to systemic ANG II.It is well known that high densities of ANG II receptors exist in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN).In addition, activation of putative angiotensinergic afferents to the PVN originating in subfornical organ (SFO) elevates blood pressure and facilitates the activity of PVN neurons.We report here that systemic administration of losartan (3 mg/kg) significantly attenuates the pressor response to electrical stimulation of SFO.The excitatory responses of PVN neurons to SFO stimulation or local pressure microinjection of ANG II were also significantly inhibited in 58.8% and 88.9% of PVN cells, respectively, by intravenous administration of losartan.These pharmacological effects were rapid and reversible, and were accompanied by little change of basal arterial blood pressure or spontaneous neuronal activity.These observations suggest that systemic losartan crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and acts at AT1 receptors within the PVN.
Nonpeptide angiotensin II antagonists: N-phenyl-1H-pyrrole derivatives are angiotensin II receptor antagonists.A series of 5-[1-[4-[(4,5-disubstituted-1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl]- substituted]-1H-pyrrol-2-yl]-1H-tetrazoles and 5-[1-[4-[(3,5-dibutyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methyl]-substituted]- 1H-pyrrol-2-yl]-1H-tetrazoles were investigated as novel AT1-selective angiotensin II receptor antagonists.Computer-assisted modeling techniques were used to evaluate structural parameters in comparison to the related biphenyl system.New synthetic procedures have been developed to prepare the novel compounds.The best antagonists in this series had IC50 values (rat uterine membrane receptor binding) in the 10(-8) M range and corresponding pA2 in isolated organ assay (rabbit aorta rings).Structure-activity relationships indicate some similarities with the finding in the biphenyl system.Substitution on the pyrrole ring modulates activity.Compound 5 antagonized angiotensin-induced blood pressure increase when administered to conscious rat at 30 mg/kg per os.
Blood pressure after stroke.A one-year follow-up study.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Blood pressure changes in the year after acute stroke have been poorly documented.METHODS: We therefore studied blood pressure for 1 year after discharge from the hospital in 226 consecutive patients (mean age, 73 years) surviving an acute stroke.RESULTS: Marked increases (p < 0.001) in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressures were seen in two thirds (69%) of the patients 1 month after discharge, and blood pressure remained stable at this level during the remainder of the follow-up year.Similar blood pressure changes were seen irrespective of sex, final stroke diagnosis, or whether the patient had a history of hypertension before the stroke.Patients with a history of hypertension had significantly higher blood pressures (p < 0.001) throughout the follow-up year than previously normotensive patients.One month after discharge blood pressure was found to have decreased in 31% of the patients;these were older and had a higher mortality during the follow-up year than patients with blood pressure increases.About 20% of all patients suffered from orthostatism (defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of > or = 20 mm Hg when rising from the supine position to standing).CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that antihypertensive treatment should not be reduced before discharge from the hospital and that blood pressure should be checked about 1 month after discharge.We suggest that standing blood pressure also be measured to make an appropriate treatment decision.
Prophylactic effect of imidapril on stroke in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been reported that some angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can prevent stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats from stroke at much higher doses than clinical doses used for hypertension therapy.This study was performed to investigate the prophylactic effectiveness of imidapril against stroke in comparison with enalapril.METHODS: Salt-loaded stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats were orally given imidapril (0.5, 1, 2, and 5 mg/kg per day), enalapril (2 and 5 mg/kg per day), or hydralazine (5 mg/kg per day).Stroke signs were scored, and blood pressure, protein concentration, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity in urine were measured.After 2 weeks of medication, angiotensin converting enzyme activities in the aorta were measured 24 hours after dosing.RESULTS: In the control group, severe hypertension developed, and all rats died within 12 weeks because of stroke.Imidapril and enalapril dose-dependently decreased the stroke-related mortality, and both agents at 5 mg/kg per day showed excellent prophylaxis, although they did not inhibit hypertensive development.Imidapril at 0.5 mg/kg per day significantly prevented stroke to almost the same extent as enalapril at 2 mg/kg per day or hydralazine at 5 mg/kg per day.Imidapril dose-dependently suppressed the elevation of the two urinary indexes, which was followed by stroke.Imidapril inhibited enzyme activity in the aorta more strongly than did enalapril at the same dose.CONCLUSIONS: Imidapril prevented the incidence of stroke in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg per day or more by amelioration of kidney dysfunction.Reduction of blood pressure is not necessary, although enzyme inhibition in the vasculature may partly relate to the effect.
Spatial features of focal infarction after hydralazine treatment in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Rapid occlusion of the middle cerebral artery above the rhinal fissure produces a large ischemic infarct in hypertensive rats, but this occlusion results in a minimal lesion in young normotensive rats.Our purpose was to attenuate rising blood pressure in young stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats with hydralazine before the occlusion to determine if the gross infarct volume is smaller, and if it is, to determine whether length, width, depth, or surface area of the infarct changes, which could suggest a mechanism of protection.METHODS: Untreated rats (n = 6) and rats receiving hydralazine for 1.5 (n = 6) or 5 (n = 5) weeks were anesthetized, and the middle cerebral artery was rapidly occluded with a ligature.One day later the rats were killed and the brains were fixed in formalin.Fine-grain-release film that is sensitive to spectral properties of the infarct was used to photograph the tissue.Infarcted areas were traced on paper and then digitized for measurements and computations with a microcomputer.RESULTS: Compared with untreated rats, tail systolic blood pressure (120 +/- 3 versus 138 +/- 4 mm Hg), infarct volume (61 +/- 4 versus 93 +/- 6 mm3), infarct surface area (39 +/- 1 versus 54 +/- 2 mm2), infarct width (3.8 +/- 0.1 versus 4.8 +/- 0.2 mm), and infarct length (6.0 +/- 0.3 versus 8.1 +/- 0.3 mm) were less in rats receiving hydralazine for 5 weeks (p < 0.05).No change was detected in infarct depth.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of young stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats with hydralazine for 5 weeks before middle cerebral artery occlusion results in a smaller infarct.The narrower, shorter dimensions indicate increased protection against lateral enlargement of the infarct and the possibility that protection was due to increased collateral blood flow through modified blood vessels.
Comparative histopathologic consequences of photothrombotic occlusion of the distal middle cerebral artery in Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have developed a minimally invasive model of photothrombotic occlusion of the distal middle cerebral artery in rats and have evaluated the patterns and features of the resulting histopathologic injury in two normotensive strains.METHODS: Food-deprived male Sprague-Dawley (n = 14) and Wistar (n = 10) rats anesthetized with halothane/nitrous oxide underwent a small craniotomy to expose the right distal middle cerebral artery just above the rhinal fissure.The animals were injected intravenously with the photosensitizing dye rose bengal, and the distal middle cerebral artery was irradiated with light from an argon laser-activated dye laser at three separate points to induce thrombotic occlusion.The ipsilateral common carotid artery was then permanently occluded, and the contralateral common carotid artery was occluded for 60 minutes.Three days later, the brains were perfusion-fixed and prepared for histopathologic examination, and infarct volume was determined by quantitative planimetry.RESULTS: In Sprague-Dawley rats, a large consistent temporoparietal cortical infarct was observed;mean +/- SD infarct volume was 130.5 +/- 40.0 mm3 (coefficient of variation, 30.7%) and a relatively small adjacent zone of selective neuronal necrosis (By contrast, Wistar rats had smaller and more variable cortical infarcts (volume, 48.4 +/- 26.9 mm3;coefficient of variation, 55.6%) but displayed a much more substantial zone of incomplete cortical infarction (volume, 20.8 +/- 10.1 mm3;30.1% of the total injury volume).In neither strain was infarct size related to alterations of blood pressure.In both strains, infarcts were limited to the cortex, typically involving the parietal cortex, somatosensory cortex, and forelimb region.Three rats exhibited infarcts in the contralateral hemisphere.CONCLUSIONS: This model has the advantages of necessitating only minimal surgery, allowing the dura to remain intact, and avoiding mechanical trauma to the brain surface.In Sprague-Dawley rats, the resulting large cortical infarct exhibited relatively small interanimal variation, making the model suitable, for example, for replicate studies of pharmacotherapy.In Wistar rats, the large zone of incomplete infarction, a unique feature heretofore undescribed in rodent models of permanent focal ischemia, lends the model to the study of the pathomechanisms underlying graded cortical ischemic injury.
Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.
Management of intracranial hypertension in head injury: matching treatment with cause.Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) is common after head injury and strongly associated with mortality and morbidity.Empirical and prophylactic therapy with steroids and barbiturates has proved unsuccessful.Ideally, therapy should be targeted at the predominant cause of the increase in ICP.In head injury these may be (1) an increase in cerebral blood volume best treated by hyperventilation and hypnotic drugs.(2) an increase in brain water content best treated by osmotherapy and (3) increased CSF outflow resistance best treated by CSF drainage.This last cause seldom predominates in head injury.To determine whether it is possible to identify the best therapy in individual head injured patients, we are comparing osmotherapy (mannitol) and hypnotic drugs (thiopentone and gamma-hydroxybutyrate) in selected patients with severe head injury where it is possible to maintain standard conditions of ventilation and stable blood pressure and to measure ICP, CPP, brain electrical activity, PR ratio of the ICP wave form and cerebral AvDO2 before and during each of the two forms of therapy.Effective therapy means that ICP has been reduced to 20 mm Hg with preservation or improvement in CPP.17 patients have been studied so far and 4 groups identified.Osmotherapy was superior to hypnotic in 5 cases, hypnotic superior to mannitol in 3 cases, both were effective in 5 cases and neither effective in 4 cases.Patients in whom hypnotics were superior tended to be younger, with diffuse rather than focal brain injury, had the highest levels of brain electrical activity prior to treatment and a higher PR ratio.
Transient myocardial ischemia after a first acute myocardial infarction and its relation to clinical characteristics, predischarge exercise testing and cardiac events at one-year follow-up.The relation between early out-of-hospital ambulatory ST-segment monitoring, clinical characteristics, predischarge maximal exercise testing and cardiac events was determined in 123 consecutive men (age 55 +/- 8 years) with a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI).During 36 hours of ambulatory recording 11 +/- 5 days after AMI 23 patients (19%) had 123 ischemic episodes (group 1), whereas 100 patients demonstrated no ischemia (group 2).Exercise-induced ST-segment depression was more prevalent in group 1 (83%) than in group 2 (47%) (p < 0.005).Group 1 patients also had more severe ischemia as judged from a shorter exercise duration before significant ST-segment depression (5.5 +/- 2.4 vs 7.7 +/- 4.1 minutes;p < 0.03) and more pronounced ST-segment depression on exercise testing (4.1 +/- 2.6 vs 2.6 +/- 1.6 mm;p < 0.03).Furthermore, exercise test results revealed an impaired hemodynamic response in group 1 compared with group 2: systolic blood pressure at maximal work load 160 +/- 31 vs 176 +/- 28 mm Hg (p < 0.025) and systolic blood pressure increase during exercise 41 +/- 24 vs 56 +/- 22 mm Hg (p < 0.01).With-in 368 +/- 8 days of follow-up the frequency of cardiac events (cardiac death, nonfatal reinfarction, and severe angina including the need of revascularization) was 52% in group 1 compared with 22% in group 2 (p < 0.01).Exercise-induced ischemia did not predict an adverse outcome: event rate 30 vs 25% in patients without residual ischemia (p = NS).
Effects of intravenous milrinone on left ventricular function in ischemic and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.M-mode echocardiography and Doppler were used to assess the effects of phosphodiesterase inhibition on subendocardial function in dilated cardiomyopathy, and in particular, to study interactions with both systolic and diastolic left ventricular function.Twelve adult patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were studied (6 ischemic in origin and 6 idiopathic), 7 of whom were being considered for cardiac transplantation.Cardiac index increased without significant change in heart rate or blood pressure.Longitudinal mitral ring motion, which had been uniformly reduced, increased markedly after intravenous milrinone.Left ventricular cavity size decreased, and shortening fraction, posterior wall thickness, and rates of posterior wall thickening and thinning increased markedly.Left atrial pressure decreased, and isovolumic relaxation time increased.However, the peak velocity and duration of the transmitral E wave increased, with no change in the A wave.Improved longitudinal (subendocardial) function was reflected by improved posterior wall dynamics, and early filling, possibly by augmentation of restoring forces.Thus, severely reduced subendocardial function in dilated cardiomyopathy is potentially reversible, with marked effects on systolic and diastolic function.These previously unrecognized actions of milrinone provide further evidence to justify its short-term use in supporting the severely depressed myocardium.
Influence of arterial blood pressure and aldosterone on left ventricular hypertrophy in moderate essential hypertension.In a group of 36 untreated patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (office systolic blood pressure [SBP] 160 +/- 3.4 mm Hg, office diastolic blood pressure [DBP], 102 +/- 1.5 mm Hg), 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and determination of left ventricular (LV) mass index according to the formula of Devereux were performed.After an overnight fast, blood samples were taken for the determination of serum aldosterone levels and plasma renin activity.Urinary catecholamine concentrations were assayed from 24-hour urine collections.Left ventricular mass index (143.7 +/- 8 g/m2) did not correlate significantly with either office SBP or office DBP.The correlation of LV mass index with mean 24-hour SBP (145 +/- 3 mm Hg) was statistically significant: r = 0.395, p = 0.026.However, the best correlation was obtained with mean 24-hour DBP (90 +/- 3 mm Hg) with r = 0.499 (p = 0.004).Urinary catecholamine levels did not correlate with LV mass index.In addition, LV mass index correlated significantly with plasma renin activity (r = 0.346, p = 0.050) and serum aldosterone levels (r = 0.559, p = 0.0009).There was a strongly significant correlation between LV mass index and serum aldosterone levels even after adjustment for mean 24-hour SBP (r = 0.496, p = 0.005) and DBP (r = 0.514, p = 0.004).These results demonstrate that ambulatory blood pressure determinations but not office blood pressure parameters correlate well with left ventricular hypertrophy in essential hypertension.Nonhemodynamic factors are important determinants of left ventricular mass as well.
Spironolactone in congestive heart failure refractory to high-dose loop diuretic and low-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.Patients with severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional classes III-IV) often can tolerate only low doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors because pronounced hypotension caused by additional ACE inhibitor increments may decrease renal perfusion.The use of high-dose loop diuretics is currently advised to overcome diuretic resistance in refractory congestive heart failure (CHF).In a baseline controlled study, we evaluated 21 patients with diuretic resistance and evident fluid retention for the responses to 5 days of double drug therapy consisting of high-dose loop diuretic (10 mg oral bumetanide) in combination with the maximum tolerable dose of an ACE inhibitor (individualized to blood pressure and kidney function).Five patients (24%) showed a gross natriuresis and reduction in excess weight > 25% in response to this therapy.The remaining 16 patients (76%) with insufficient responses (i.e., < 25% reduction in excess weight) subsequently received 100 mg spironolactone once a day for 7 days in addition to the double therapy.Spironolactone coadministration was highly effective in 13 of 16 patients (81%).Marked natriuresis and diuresis were achieved within the next week of treatment, and CHF symptoms regressed or disappeared.The clinical course was similar in the bumetanide-ACE inhibitor and the bumetanide-ACE inhibitor-spironolactone treatment (triple therapy) groups.Plasma aldosterone was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the patients who needed spironolactone.The 3 patients who were considered refractory to triple therapy exhibited the highest baseline plasma aldosterone concentrations.
Dose-related cardiovascular effects of spironolactone.The aim of this study was to assess the short-term hemodynamic effects of increasing doses of spironolactone (25, 50, and 75 mg/day) on oliguric patients (5 men, mean age 47 +/- 12 years) undergoing hemodialysis for chronic renal impairment.Parameters of interest included heart rate (HR), cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance (SVR), arterial pressure, right atrial pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).The study also evaluated how spironolactone modified the effects on arterial and right atrial pressures and PCWP of infusion of increasing doses of norepinephrine (20, 40, and 100 ng/kg/min) and angiotensin II (2, 4, and 10 ng/kg/min).Compared with placebo, the lowest dose of spironolactone (25 mg/day) produced statistically significant (p < 0.05) modifications in systemic arterial pressures without a compensatory increase in cardiac output.The modifications were more pronounced at 50 and 75 mg/day, and the latter had a significant dose-dependent effect.Moreover, doses of 50 and 75 mg/day produced significant (p < 0.05) decreases in right atrial pressure and PCWP.Spironolactone administration caused the curve expressing the relation between an infused norepinephrine or angiotensin II dose and the blood pressure response to shift significantly (p < 0.05 to < 0.01) to the right, and the pressor doses of norepinephrine or angiotensin II showed a significant (p < 0.05 to < 0.01) dose-related increase, suggesting that treatment with spironolactone inhibited cardiovascular reactivity.This effect was observed on both the capacitance (i.e., low-pressure) and resistance (i.e., high pressure) vessels.
Decreased risk of stroke among postmenopausal hormone users.Results from a national cohort.OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of postmenopausal hormone use on the risk of stroke incidence and stroke mortality.DESIGN: Longitudinal study consisting of three data collection waves.The average follow up for cohort members was 11.9 years (maximum, 16.3 years).Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the relative risk of stroke for postmenopausal hormone ever-users compared with never-users.PARTICIPANTS: A national sample of 1910 (of 2371 eligible) white postmenopausal women who were 55 to 74 years old when examined in 1971 through 1975 as part of the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and who did not report a history of stroke at that time.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measure was incident stroke (fatal and nonfatal).Events were determined from discharge diagnosis information coded from hospital and nursing home records and cause of death information coded from death certificates collected during the follow-up period (1971 through 1987).RESULTS: There were 250 incident cases of stroke identified, including 64 deaths with stroke listed as the underlying cause.The age-adjusted incidence rate of stroke among postmenopausal hormone ever-users was 82 per 10,000 woman-years of follow-up compared with 124 per 10,000 among never-users.Postmenopausal hormone use remained a protective factor against stroke incidence (relative risk, 0.69;95% confidence interval, 0.47 to 1.00) and stroke mortality (relative risk, 0.37;95% confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.92) after adjusting for the baseline risk factors of age, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, body mass index, smoking, history of hypertension and heart attack, and socioeconomic status.CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that postmenopausal hormone use is associated with a decrease in risk of stroke incidence and mortality in white postmenopausal women.
Experimental results using nafamostat mesilate as anticoagulant during extracorporeal lung assist for 24 hours in dogs.We report on the experimental application of nafamostat mesilate (NM, 6-amidino-2-naphthyl p-guanidinobenzoate dimethanesulfonate, FUT), a new anticoagulant, to extracorporeal lung assist (ECLA) with an artificial membrane lung.Venovenous ECLA, from the jugular vein to the femoral vein, was performed with a hollow-fiber membrane lung at a blood flow rate of approximate 82 ml kg-1 min-1 for 24 h in 7 dogs under anesthesia and hypoventilation.Heparin (10 U ml-1 in a priming lactated Ringer solution of 140 ml, and 200 U kg-1) was administered before blood access cannulation.After start of ECLA, however, no heparin was used, and nafamostat mesilate was continuously infused into the drainage line of the bypass circuit to control activated coagulation time (ACT) at about 150 to 200 s.To maintain the prolonged ACT, 8.0 +/- 1.7 mg kg-1 h-1 of NM was required.Arterial blood pressure and pulse rate decreased significantly.Though fibrin monomer test revealed hypercoagulability after 6 h of ECLA, platelet counts did not significantly decrease.Total blood loss remained less than 40 g.The artificial membrane lung sustained a good gas exchange and low flow resistance throughout ECLA.Macroscopic examination revealed small spotty thrombi in the artificial lung but no major pathologic changes of the visceral organs in the all dogs at autopsy.High-dose NM administration could control blood coagulation and decrease blood loss during ECLA for 24 h without deterioration of the artificial lung and systemic complication other than mild hypotension and bradycardia.
Combined use of labetalol and nifedipine in controlling the cardiovascular response from ECT.Serious cardiac complications have been reported to occur in elderly depressed patients during a course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).As a result, cardiac medications are being used more often to dampen the cardiovascular response that occurs during an ECT treatment.Specifically, labetalol (a mixed alpha- and beta-blocker) has been shown to effectively control the heart rate during ECT.However, on occasion, patients may still exhibit sustained elevations of blood pressure during ECT when receiving labetalol.The optimum clinical management of these patients is unclear.The authors report on the safety and efficacy of combining nifedipine with labetalol to control blood pressure during ECT in ten elderly patients whose blood pressures were not adequately controlled by labetalol alone.No adverse effects were noted, nor did nifedipine appear to shorten seizure duration.
Arterial alterations with aging and high blood pressure.A noninvasive study of carotid and femoral arteries.Noninvasive in situ evaluations of pulsatile changes of blood pressure and arterial diameter were performed at the sites of the common carotid and femoral arteries in a population of 78 untreated normotensive and hypertensive subjects.Arterial segments were studied by using an original echo-tracking technique for internal diameter and validated applanation tonometry for local pulse pressure measurements.Whereas mean arterial pressure is known to be identical in all parts of the arterial tree, pulse pressure was significantly lower in the carotid (52.7 +/- 2.2 mm Hg) than in the brachial (62.0 +/- 2.0 mm Hg) or femoral (62.5 +/- 2.5 mm Hg) arteries.Despite a higher pulse pressure and diastolic diameter, the femoral artery had a lower pulsatile change in diameter (3.47 +/- 0.18% versus 6.07 +/- 0.28%;p < 0.0001) and distensibility coefficient (9.36 +/- 0.58 versus 21.60 +/- 1.75 x 10(-3) kPa-1) than the carotid artery.Local cross-sectional compliance of the carotid artery was higher than that of the femoral artery (7.42 +/- 0.46 versus 6.20 +/- 0.28 m2.kPa-1.10(-7);p < 0.05).Whereas age was strongly correlated with arterial parameters at the site of the carotid artery (pulse pressure: r = 0.54, p < 0.0001;pulsatile change in arterial diameter: r = -0.62, p < 0.0001;distensibility coefficient: r = -0.70, p < 0.0001), no significant correlation was observed at the femoral artery.Mean blood pressure was the second factor of carotid artery alterations: the higher the mean blood pressure, the lower the distensibility of this artery (r = -0.36, p < 0.01).
Effects of yohimbine on plasma catecholamine levels in orthostatic hypotension related to Parkinson disease or multiple system atrophy.Different pathophysiological mechanisms may underly orthostatic hypotension (OH) observed in neurological degenerative disorders.The present study investigates the responses to the pharmacological activation of sympathetic pathways induced by yohimbine (0.2 mg/kg orally) through measurements of plasma catecholamine levels in parkinsonian patients with (n = 9) or without OH (n = 11), in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA) plus OH (n = 9), and in controls (n = 6).Basal norepinephrine plasma levels in parkinsonian patients with OH (71 +/- 11 pg/ml) were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in parkinsonian patients without OH (280 +/- 25 pg/ml) or in controls (259 +/- 48 pg/ml).In patients with MSA plus OH, basal catecholamine plasma levels were in the normal range (344 +/- 54 pg/ml).Yohimbine significantly increased norepinephrine (p < 0.05) but not epinephrine plasma levels in all groups.However, the increment obtained in parkinsonian patients with OH (+53 +/- 18 pg/ml) remained significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in parkinsonian patients without OH or in controls (+638 +/- 140 and +457 +/- 103 pg/ml, respectively) as well as in MSA plus OH (+633 +/- 142 pg/ml).Yohimbine failed to modify the blood pressure and heart rate at the dose used.The results suggest that the yohimbine test is useful to elucidate the site of the dysfunction of the efferent sympathetic pathways in these two conditions.In Parkinson disease with OH, the lesion is both central and postganglionnic, whereas in MSA it is only centrally located.
Doxorubicin and local hyperthermia in the microcirculation of skeletal muscle.Doxorubicin HCl (Doxo) is an established intercalating antitumor drug.Specific side effects of Doxo primarily affect the cardiac muscle tissue to cause cardiac arrhythmias and chronic cardiomyopathies.The mechanism of action of these side effects is incompletely understood.Thus, the first objective of the present study was to test whether Doxo might have a direct effect on the microcirculation of muscular tissue.We studied large and small arterioles and large venules in the cremaster muscle of rats before and after sequential infusion of 1 (low-dose) and 10 mg/kg (high-dose) Doxo.Large arterioles showed some constriction after low Doxo doses and pronounced constriction after high Doxo doses, whereas small arterioles showed a variable response to low Doxo doses.At high Doxo doses, small arterioles dilated almost maximally (80% of the maximal response to nitroprusside).The heart rate and the diameter of large venules did not change at high Doxo doses, although the blood pressure decreased.This indicates that Doxo directly affects skeletal muscle arterioles.The second purpose of this study was to determine whether local hyperthermia would influence the microcirculation of muscular tissue such that the systemic concentration of Doxo could be reduced.In this second series of experiments, we tested whether local hyperthermia would have an effect on the skeletal muscle microvasculature and whether Doxo would change that response.Local hyperthermia alone did not alter the diameter of small arterioles or large venules, but we observed constriction of large arterioles at temperatures above 37 degrees C and during continued (60-min) hyperthermia at 40 degrees C.The low dose of Doxo did not alter these microvascular diameters at 40 degrees C.However, local hyperthermia at 40 degrees C changed the response of small arterioles to low doxo doses (no vasodilation was observed).Large arterioles continued to constrict in response to Doxo during hyperthermia.These data suggest that large arteriolar responses could be partly responsible for the toxic effect of Doxo on cardiac muscle and that local hyperthermia potentiates that response.
Diabetic kidney disease in Pima Indians.OBJECTIVE--To describe the natural history of kidney disease in Pima Indians with NIDDM.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--Review of previous studies describing diabetic kidney disease in this Native-American population and in other populations.RESULTS--NIDDM is the leading cause of renal failure in Pima Indians, among whom the incidence of ESRD is 23 times that of the general U.S. population.The high incidence of NIDDM and its early onset in the Pima undoubtedly contribute to this difference.The incidence of overt nephropathy and ESRD, as a function of diabetes duration, is at least as high in Pima Indians with NIDDM as that reported in other populations with IDDM.Furthermore, nearly all of the excess mortality associated with NIDDM is found in individuals with overt nephropathy.Mild elevations of UAE, which may be present even shortly after the onset of diabetes, predict the development of overt nephropathy in diabetic Pimas.Additional predictors include high blood pressure, level of glycemia, duration of diabetes, family history of diabetic nephropathy, and type of diabetes treatment.CONCLUSIONS--Diabetic kidney disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Pima Indians.The natural history of diabetic kidney disease in this population is similar, in many ways, to the natural history described in individuals with IDDM.
Elevated serum sialic acid concentration in NIDDM and its relationship to blood pressure and retinopathy.OBJECTIVE--In view of the possible link between serum sialic acid and cardiovascular disease in the general population, we investigated whether serum total and lipid-associated sialic concentrations are elevated in NIDDM patients compared with normal subjects.We also investigated how sialic acid levels relate to glycemic control, blood pressure, microalbuminuria, retinopathy, and serum lipid levels.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--We selected 20 NIDDM patients at random and matched them for age and sex with 20 normal subjects.The patients also had a similar BMI as the control subjects.A first morning blood sample was taken for sialic acid, glucose, fructosamine, and lipid analysis, as was a first morning urine sample for assessment of microalbuminuria.Retinopathy was assessed by fundoscopy.RESULTS--Both total and lipid-associated sialic acid levels were elevated in the NIDDM patients compared with control subjects (mean +/- SD, total: 0.74 +/- 0.11 vs.0.60 +/- 0.22 g/L, P < 0.02;lipid-associated: 0.18 +/- 0.04 vs 0.12 +/- 0.04 g/L, P < 0.001).Total serum sialic acid was correlated with systolic blood pressure (r = 0.58, P < 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.58, P < 0.02).There was no significant relationship of total sialic acid with age, duration of diabetes, BMI, microalbuminuria, serum triglyceride, blood glucose, or serum fructosamine.A relationship of lipid-associated sialic acid levels and systolic blood pressure did not reach significance (P = 0.09).In 9 patients with background retinopathy with or without maculopathy, the total serum sialic acid concentration was higher than in those without retinopathy (0.81 +/- 0.09 vs.0.69 +/- 0.10 g/L, P < 0.008).Lipid-associated sialic acid levels were similar in those with and without retinopathy.(The conversion factor for standard units to SI units is 1 gL = 3.2 mM.) CONCLUSIONS--Total serum sialic acid levels were significantly elevated in a relatively small group of NIDDM patients and were correlated with hypertension and retinopathy.A larger study of circulating sialic acid concentrations as a risk factor for the development or marker of diabetic angiopathy is therefore justified.
Double-level cauda equina compression: an experimental study with continuous monitoring of intraneural blood flow in the porcine cauda equina.Compression of the spinal nerve roots may occur clinically at multiple levels at the same time;however, the basic pathophysiology of multi-level compression is largely unknown.In this study, the intraneural blood flow was analyzed continuously in the uncompressed segment between two compression balloons, with a pig used as an experimental model and a thermal diffusion method.At 10 mm Hg compression, there was a 64% reduction of total blood flow in the uncompressed segment compared with pre-compression values.Total ischemia occurred at pressures 10-20 mm Hg below the mean arterial blood pressure.After two-level compression at 200 mm Hg for 10 min, there was a gradual recovery of the intraneural blood flow towards the baseline.Recovery was less rapid and less complete after 2 h of compression.Double-level compression of the cauda equina can thus induce impairment of blood flow, not only at the compression sites, but also in the intermediate nerve segments located between two compression sites, even at very low pressures.These findings may have clinical importance in the understanding of the pathophysiology of multiple-level cauda equina compression.
Hormonal and cardiovascular effects of losartan (DuP753), an angiotensin receptor antagonist, in nonhuman primates.Experiments were carried out in conscious dexamethasone-treated cynomolgus monkeys in an attempt to determine if losartan (DuP753) inhibited endogenous as well as exogenous angiotensin II stimulation of angiotensin receptors in vivo.Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were monitored via a radiotelemetry system and blood samples were obtained via vascular access ports for determination of plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone (PA).Intravenous infusions of angiotensin II elicited reproducible pressor responses and increases in PA.The elevations of blood pressure and PA were completely blocked by losartan (10 mg/kg i.v.).Studies with normal monkeys showed that losartan (10 mg/kg i.v.) elicited a modest hypotension and hyper-reninemia without significantly altering PA.In contrast, studies with sodium-depleted monkeys showed that losartan (1 and 10 mg/kg i.v.) elicited hypotension, a decrease in PA and hyper-reninemia in a dose-related manner.Losartan did not significantly alter heart rate in either the normal or the sodium-depleted monkeys.These results were consistent with the conclusion that losartan was an inhibitor of endogenous as well as exogenous angiotensin II stimulation of vascular smooth muscle and adrenal cortical receptors.
Hypertension and dyslipidemia in patients with insulinoma.Hyperinsulinemia is alleged to contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension and dyslipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia) in the setting of insulin resistance.To assess the association among hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia in the absence of insulin resistance, we determined their prevalence in a large cohort of patients with insulinoma (N = 250).In this retrospective case-control study, patients with insulinoma were matched by age, gender, race, and year of operation with 217 control patients admitted to the hospital for elective cholecystectomy.Mean preoperative blood pressure measurements were compared between study patients and control patients.In addition, age-, gender-, and race-specific percentiles of blood pressure were compared with data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I, and those of triglycerides (N = 65) and cholesterol (N = 70) were compared with Mayo Clinic normal reference data.The study group consisted of 105 men and 145 women;the median age was 41 years (range, 8 to 82).The median duration of symptoms before operation was 1.9 years (range, 0.05 to 40 years).After adjustment for body mass index, no statistically significant differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were noted between patients with insulinoma and matched control patients (131 +/- 19 versus 128 +/- 18 mm Hg and 81 +/- 11 versus 79 +/- 9 mm Hg, respectively).No relationship was observed between duration of hyperinsulinemia (as long as 40 years) and blood pressure.The age- and gender-specific percentiles of systolic and diastolic blood pressure of the patients with insulinoma did not differ from the age- and gender-specific percentiles for the general white population.
Idiopathic postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: an attenuated form of acute pandysautonomia?To characterize the idiopathic postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), we reviewed the records of all patients aged 20 to 51 who presented to the Mayo Autonomic Reflex Laboratory and who exhibited tachycardia at rest or during head-up tilt.These patients were usually women who experienced an acute onset of persistent lightheadedness and fatigue or gastrointestinal dysmotility.In seven patients, a viral illness may have preceded the onset of symptoms.In two instances, signs and symptoms of a small-fiber sensory neuropathy were present.Laboratory evaluation of autonomic function revealed increased diastolic blood pressure to tilt (5/16), increased Valsalva ratio, marked decrease in phase II of the Valsalva maneuver with normal phase IV overshoot, and normal forced respiratory sinus arrhythmia.Abnormal quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test and thermoregulatory sweat test and an excessive orthostatic increase of catecholamines were found in some patients.We conclude that in many instances POTS may be a manifestation of a mild form of acute autonomic neuropathy.
Alterations in maternal-fetal Doppler flow velocity waveforms in preterm labor patients undergoing magnesium sulfate tocolysis.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of magnesium on fetal hemodynamics in mothers treated with magnesium sulfate for preterm labor.METHODS: Twenty women who presented to the Carolinas Medical Center in preterm labor between 24-35 weeks' gestation were enrolled in the study.Pulsed-wave Doppler measurements were made from the fetal middle cerebral artery, the fetal umbilical artery, and the maternal uterine arteries before the initiation of magnesium sulfate tocolysis and during its intravenous administration.Baseline measurements were compared with intra-therapy measurements using paired t tests.RESULTS: During the administration of magnesium sulfate, the fetal middle cerebral artery diastolic blood flow velocity decreased significantly (P = .05) and the maternal uterine artery diastolic blood flow velocity increased significantly (P = .01).There were no significant changes in the umbilical artery diastolic blood flow measurements.These findings remained the same after adjusting for gestational age, estimated fetal weight, frequency of contractions, serum magnesium level at the time of the intra-therapy Doppler study, and maternal blood pressure.CONCLUSION: The alterations in fetal hemodynamics during magnesium sulfate administration suggest a physiologic normalization process related to the stressed preterm infant and the preterm labor process itself.
Contribution of plasma vasopressin concentration and blood pressure to norepinephrine-induced diuresis in conscious dogs.Infusion of norepinephrine (NE) into humans and experimental animals induces diuresis by mechanisms that are not completely understood.Two series of experiments were performed to determine whether changes in plasma levels of vasopressin or changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) are important-factors in NE-induced diuresis in conscious dogs.First, plasma vasopressin (PAVP) levels were measured in normal and cardiac-denervated conscious dogs during a 30-min intravenous infusion of NE (0.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1).When NE was administered to normal dogs, urine flow increased from 0.3 +/- 0.1 to 0.9 +/- 0.4 ml/min.PAVP did not decrease, in spite of increases in mean arterial pressure (from 103 +/- 4 to 123 +/- 6 mm Hg) and left atrial pressure (from 5.2 +/- 0.9 to 8.6 +/- 1.4 mm Hg).The same dose of NE infused into cardiac-denervated dogs significantly increased urine flow (from 0.2 +/- 0.1 to 0.8 +/- 0.3 ml/min) and MAP (from 107 +/- 5 to 147 +/- 10 mm Hg), and decreased PAVP (from 1.8 +/- 0.3 pg/ml to 1.2 +/- 0.3 pg/ml).In the second series of experiments, NE was infused into cardiac-denervated dogs for 40 min.During the final 20 min of NE infusion, nitroprusside was infused to offset the pressor effect of NE by returning MAP to the initial control level.Urine flow increased during the first 20 min in which NE alone was given;however, when MAP was returned to the control level by nitroprusside infusion, urine flow also returned to the control level.PAVP increased from a control value of 3.6 +/- 0.6 to 18.9 +/- 3.8 pg/ml 15 min after the NP infusion had begun.We conclude that a decrease in PAVP is not required to elicit diuresis during NE infusion in normal conscious dogs and that the pressor effect of NE appears to play a major role in NE-induced diuresis.
Fatty acids may regulate aldosterone secretion and mediate some of insulin's effects on blood pressure.Experiments in vitro and observation made in humans suggest that some unesterified fatty acids (FA) participate, as inhibitors, in the regulation of aldosterone secretion.Removal of FA from adrenal glomerulosa cells with albumin increases the responses to angiotensin II (AII) and dibutyryl cyclic AMP.Micromolar concentrations of some FA including arachidonic, oleic, linoleic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic inhibit aldosterone secretion by adrenal glomerulosa cells.Inhibition is specific--some acids like stearic are inactive, and the adrenal fasciculata is relatively resistant to inhibition.Oleic acid rapidly and reversibly inhibits aldosterone secretion by perfused dog adrenals.Observations in vivo suggest a reciprocal relationship between plasma levels of FA and aldosterone: insulin infusion into dogs lowers plasma FA and increases adrenal responsiveness to All;salt infusions into humans increase plasma FA as aldosterone falls;plasma FA are low in low-renin essential hypertension where adrenal responsiveness to All is high;plasma FA are inversely correlated with ratios of aldosterone to renin in black hypertensives;and plasma FA are high in some seriously ill patients whose aldosterone levels are inexplicably low.All receptors and the final step of aldosterone biosynthesis, oxidation at the 18 position, are the adrenal sites most sensitive to FA.Insulin's antinatriuresis may be mediated in part by its ability to lower plasma FA and thereby enhance adrenal response to secretagogues.
Blood pressure and heart rate during orthostatic stress and walking with continuous postoperative thoracic epidural bupivacaine/morphine.Thirty-one patients scheduled for elective cholecystectomy performed through a mini-laparotomy, were randomized to received either combined thoracic epidural anaesthesia/light general anaesthesia and postoperative balanced analgesia with continuous epidural bupivacaine 10 mg.h-1 and morphine 0.2 mg.h-1 for 38 h after surgery plus systemic ibuprofen 600 mg x 8 h-1 (N = 15) or general anaesthesia and postoperative analgesia with systemic morphine and ibuprofen 600 mg x 8 h-1 (N = 16).During postoperative epidural infusion sensory blockade to pinprick was Th4 to L1, and analgesia at rest and during mobilisation was superior compared to systemic morphine and NSAID.There were no significant differences between groups in haemodynamic responses (BP and heart rate) during rest, orthostatic stress and after walking assessed before, 24 and 48 h after operation except for a clinically unimportant lower heart rate (approximately 10 bpm) 48 h after surgery at rest and during orthostatic stress in the epidural group.There was no significant difference between groups in number of patients with a reduction > 20 mmHg (2.7 kPa) in systolic blood pressure during orthostatic stress (two in each group at 24 h) or in number of episodes of dizziness, nausea or vomiting during rest or mobilisation.These results do not support the common belief that low-dose thoracic epidural bupivacaine/morphine may prevent ambulation due to sympathetic blockade or to impaired cardiovascular adaptation to the upright position.
The cardiovascular response to ketamine: the effects of clonidine and lignocaine.The effectiveness of clonidine or lignocaine in reducing the cardiostimulatory effects of ketamine was studied.A double-blind, randomized design was used in three groups of 20 patients each, of ASA grade 1 or 2 presenting for minor elective surgery.The clonidine group received 0.3 mg clonidine orally with the premedication while the lignocaine group received 1.5 mg.kg-1 lignocaine prior to induction.The third group formed the controls.All patients were induced with 2 mg.kg-1 ketamine intravenously.The systolic blood pressure in the clonidine group was significantly lower than that of both the control and lignocaine groups throughout the study (P < 0.05).It was concluded that clonidine was effective in reducing the hypertensive response to ketamine, whereas lignocaine had no effect.
Myocardial ischaemia as judged from transoesophageal echocardiography and ECG in the early phase after coronary artery bypass surgery.The incidence of myocardial ischaemia, as diagnosed by transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) versus ECG, and the relationship between ischaemic events and haemodynamic parameters were studied in 30 patients in the early phase after coronary artery bypass grafting.Information comprising invasive haemodynamics, TEE measurements, and 12-lead ECG was obtained on arrival of the patient in the intensive care unit (ICU), and then hourly in the ICU for 5 h.In the ICU, TEE signs of ischaemia were found in 14 patients and ECG signs of ischaemia in six patients.The ischaemic events were not related to levels of blood pressure or heart rate.Three patients showed signs of myocardial infarction postoperatively.All three of these patients showed both TEE and ECG signs of ischaemia in the ICU.It was concluded that TEE reveals more ischaemic events than ECG in the early postoperative period and that these ischaemic events do not correlate with the haemodynamic indices.
Plasma ascorbic acid concentrations relate inversely to blood pressure in human subjects.This study relates antioxidant status and blood pressure (BP) in 168 healthy residents of Augusta, GA, following usual diets.BP ranges were systolic (S) 84-152, mean 112 +/- 1 mm Hg, and diastolic (D) 52-96, mean 72 +/- 1 mm Hg.Plasma concentrations of ascorbic acid (AA) were significantly inversely related to SBP (r = -0.18, P < 0.05) and DBP (r = -0.20, P < 0.01);with regression equations SBP vs AA = -0.083C + 116 and DBP = -0.077C + 76.Highest and lowest quintiles of AA differed significantly in mean SBP (108 +/- 2, 113 +/- 2 mm Hg) and DBP (69 +/- 1, 74 +/- 2), P < 0.05.Plasma AA concentrations were significantly lower in the smokers.By deleting smokers, the inverse relations of SBP and DBP with plasma AA and the slopes of the equation were enhanced.Plasma selenium, alpha-tocopherol, alpha-tocopherol:cholesterol ratio, retinol and taurine were not related to BP;whereas male gender, body mass index, body fat distribution, plasma cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides correlated.
Role of glomerular epithelial cell injury in the pathogenesis of glomerular scarring in the rat remnant kidney model.We investigated the roles of glomerular epithelial cell (GEC) pathology and dysfunction in the pathogenesis of glomerular scarring and attempted to separate them from direct hypertensive injury in the 5/6 nephrectomy (RK) model of glomerular injury.Male WKY rats weighing 200 g were studied 6 weeks after RK, when approximately one-half had developed systemic hypertension (systolic blood pressure > or = 150 mm Hg) (HT), and one-half were normotensive (NT).The incidence of glomerular necrosis and scarring was greatest in the HT rats (P = 0.0259), and vascular necrosis was only seen in 4 of 11 HT rats.The RK group had increased glomerular diameters (HT, 174 mu mean;NT, 171 mu;sham, 142 mu;P = 0.0014 by analysis of variance).There was foot process effacement in the HT and NT groups (HT, 104 filtration slits/100 mu glomerular basement membrane;NT, 112 mu;sham, 143 mu;P < 0.005 by analysis of variance), but GEC separation from the glomerular basement membrane was not significant in either HT or NT rats.GEC function was determined from protamine-heparin aggregate disappearance curves, and the curves, representing GEC endocytosis, were not different in either HT or NT groups compared with the sham-operated groups.These findings suggest that GEC function is preserved in RK, and the changes in glomerular size and GEC morphology are nonlethal and adaptive.The morphological appearance of the acute glomerular and vascular lesions and their presence only in HT animals is consistent with a hypertensive pathogenesis.The glomerular sclerosis seen in both HT and NT may result from either resolution of acute lesions with scarring and/or adaptive changes in glomerular structure and cellular functions other than the GEC clearance function we studied.
Influence of different glucose-insulin-potassium regimes on glucose homeostasis and hormonal response in cardiac surgery patients .Intravenous infusion of glucose/insulin in combination with potassium (GIK) is an often used technique to improve myocardial preservation in cardiac surgery.In a randomized study in 50 patients undergoing elective aortocoronary bypass grafting with good ventricular function, the influence on glucose homeostasis and hormonal response to four different glucose/insulin regimes were compared to an untreated control: 1) 50 g of glucose mixed with 100 U of human insulin (HI/100);2) 50 g of glucose mixed with 100 U of bovine insulin (BI/100);3) 50 g of glucose mixed with 50 U of human insulin (HI/50);and 4) 50 g of glucose mixed with 50 U of bovine insulin (BI/50) [corrected].Glucose/insulin were given in combination with 70 mmol of potassium 40 min before beginning the operation.In addition to blood glucose concentrations various endocrine variables were studied before, during and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).Hemodynamic data (arterial blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance) were similar in all five groups.Inotropic support after CPB was necessary in none of the patients.Blood glucose levels showed no differences among all GIK groups (groups 1-4) but were significantly higher than in the control patients.The incidence of severely reduced (< 50 mg/dL) or elevated blood glucose level (> 300 mg/dL) did not differ between HI- and BI-treated patients but was significantly lower in the untreated control.Insulin plasma level increased significantly after infusion of GIK with higher levels in HI- than BI-treated patients (P < 0.05).
Effect of intracarotid and intraventricular morphine on regional cerebral blood flow and metabolism in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs.Potent opiate analgesics, administered either epidurally, intrathecally, or intravenously, are a common adjunct to pain control in the perioperative period.Little is known, however, of the effects of opiate agonists on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism.Current studies are complicated by the hypotensive effects of these compounds and their route of administration.To circumvent these difficulties we studied the effects of intraventricular and intracarotid morphine sulfate, in doses that do not affect arterial blood pressure, on regional CBF and total cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs.Five dogs received 0.04 mg/kg morphine via intracarotid injection.Five additional dogs received 0.2 mg/kg morphine via ventricular cisternal infusion over 5 min, and five control dogs received mock cerebrospinal fluid at the same infusion rate.CBF was measured using the radiolabeled microsphere technique.Intracarotid morphine decreased neurohypophyseal blood flow to 58% of control, but it did not alter blood flow to any other brain region, except caudate nucleus, or cause a change in CMRO2.Infusion of mock cerebrospinal fluid in the cerebral ventricles did not alter CBF or CMRO2.Ventricular-cisternal perfusion of morphine caused a transient increase in CBF (24 +/- 2 to 37 +/- 6 mL min-1 100 kg-1) but had no effect on spinal cord blood flow or CMRO2.Neurohypophyseal blood flow, however, decreased to 40% of control levels (480 +/- 76 to 176 +/- 42 mL min-1 100 kg-1) after 2 min and gradually returned to control levels at 60 min.
Negative inotropic effects of propofol as evaluated by the regional preload recruitable stroke work relationship in chronically instrumented dogs.BACKGROUND: Propofol anesthesia often is associated with marked decreases in arterial blood pressure.Previous investigations in vivo have provided conflicting reasons for this clinical finding, including propofol-induced decreases in preload or afterload and/or direct myocardial depressant effects.Interpretation of the results of these studies is complicated by use of indices of myocardial contractility that may only indirectly indicate changes in inotropic state or are significantly dependent on ventricular loading conditions.METHODS: Eight experiments were performed using dogs chronically instrumented for measurement of aortic and left ventricular pressure, the peak rate of increase of left ventricular pressure (dP/dtmax), subendocardial segment length, intrathoracic pressure, and cardiac output.Myocardial contractility was evaluated in conscious and anesthetized dogs using the preload recruitable stroke work (PRSW) relationship, a sensitive, easily quantified, and relatively load-independent index of contractile function in normal canine myocardium in vivo.The relationship was derived from ventricular pressure-segment length loops generated by abrupt vena caval constriction.Respiratory variation in ventricular pressure was reduced by calculation of transmural pressure via instantaneous subtraction of intrathoracic pressure from corresponding left ventricular pressure.Systemic hemodynamics and myocardial contractility were recorded and evaluated in the conscious state and after a bolus of 5 mg/kg and a propofol infusion for 15 min at 15, 30, 60, and 120 mg.kg-1.h-1.RESULTS: A significant (P < .05) and dose-dependent decrease in PRSW slope (106 +/- 7 during control to 54 +/- 3 mmHg at the 120 mg.kg-1.h-1 infusion) was observed, demonstrating a direct depression of contractility.Concomitant decreases in left ventricular dP/dtmax and percent segment shortening also were observed.In addition, a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance occurred at the two largest infusions.CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the significant decrease in systemic arterial blood pressure observed during continuous propofol anesthesia in dogs is a result of direct negative inotropic actions of propofol along with its direct effects upon arterial and venous vascular tone.
Effect of midazolam infusion and flumazenil administration on epinephrine arrhythmogenicity in dogs anesthetized with halothane.BACKGROUND: Midazolam is being selected increasingly for use in patients with cardiovascular compromise.Although clinical doses of midazolam have minimal effects on cardiac function, the influence of midazolam (and other benzodiazepine sedatives) on cardiac arrhythmogenesis has yet to be elucidated fully.METHODS: In this study, we investigated the effect of midazolam, with and without flumazenil, on the arrhythmogenic serum concentration of epinephrine (ACE) in six halothane-anesthetized dogs.Midazolam was administered as a loading dose (1.5 mg/kg over 5 min) followed by a 4.5-h infusion at two rates (10 and 40 micrograms.kg-1 x min-1) to achieve and maintain predetermined clinical and supraclinical plasma midazolam concentrations.The arrhythmogenic serum concentration of epinephrine determinations were made prior to midazolam infusion, following 2 h of midazolam infusion and following 3.5 h of midazolam infusion and 1 mg flumazenil/kg i.v.Saline control studies were also performed in four of the six dogs.RESULTS: Plasma midazolam concentrations ranged from 363 to 855 ng/ml in the low-dose infusion study, essentially spanning the clinically effective range for humans.In the high-dose infusion study, plasma midazolam concentrations were up to four times greater, ranging from 1168 to 3563 ng/ml.The arrhythmogenic serum concentration of epinephrine values were unchanged following low-dose midazolam infusion and saline.In the high-dose study, ACE increased from baseline values of 68 +/- 13 (SEM) ng/ml to 112 +/- 25 ng/ml (P = .03) following midazolam infusion and decreased to 79 +/- 13 ng/ml with flumazenil administration.Plasma midazolam concentrations, however, were poorly correlated with ACE values normalized for control ACE (ACE ratio).Diastolic arterial pressure was significantly depressed following both low-dose (-14%) and high-dose (-19%) midazolam infusion.This decrease in blood pressure was unaffected by flumazenil administration.Other hemodynamic parameters were unaffected by drug treatment.CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated that midazolam infusion results in either no effect (with clinical plasma midazolam concentrations) or flumazenil-reversible suppression (with supraclinical concentrations) of halothane-epinephrine arrhythmogenesis.
Halothane decreases the rate of production of cerebrospinal fluid.Possible role of vasopressin V1 receptors.BACKGROUND: Circulating vasoactive hormones (e.g., vasopressin) play an important role in the regulation of blood flow to the choroid plexus and the rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production.We tested the hypothesis that halothane decreases CSF production through a vasopressin-related mechanism and examined the related changes in blood flow to the choroid plexus.METHODS: Using ventriculocisternal perfusion, CSF production was measured in chloralose anesthetized, normothermic rabbits whose lungs were mechanically ventilated.Rabbits received either 0.5 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC;end-tidal) of halothane (added to a preestablished chloralose anesthetic), 0.5 MAC of halothane in the presence of a vasopressin V1 antagonist (iv), or the V1 antagonist alone.In addition, we examined animals in which no intervention was made (time control) and animals subjected to a 25% decrease in mean blood pressure produced by hemorrhage, with and without the V1-antagonist.In a separate series of rabbits, regional and total blood flows to the brain and the choroid plexus were measured using radioactive microspheres.These studies were carried out under similar conditions, except that the effects of end-tidal 0.25, 0.5, and 1 MAC of halothane were examined in each rabbit (each added to a preestablished chloralose anesthetic).RESULTS: Under control conditions, blood flow to the choroid plexus averaged 351 +/- 198 ml.min-1.100 g-1 (mean +/- SD) and CSF production averaged 10.1 +/- 1.9 microliters.min.-1.Halothane (0.25, 0.5, and 1 MAC) did not alter choroid plexus blood flow but decreased CSF production by 28 +/- 6% at 0.5 MAC (P < .05).In contrast, 1 MAC of halothane increased total blood flow to the brain by 20 +/- 25% (P < .05).The V1 antagonist, which did not affect production of CSF when given alone, prevented the decrease in CSF production in response to halothane.Hemorrhage decreased blood flow to the choroid plexus but not to the brain, and the V1 antagonist attenuated the decrease in the rate of CSF production by hemorrhage (34 +/- 11% vs.48 +/- 18%, P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: Halothane decreases CSF production with no net change in the blood flow to the choroid plexus.Decrease in CSF production appears to be mediated through a vasopressin-related mechanism and not to the blood pressure decrease seen during halothane anesthesia.
Functional benefits of peripheral vascular bypass surgery for patients with intermittent claudication.Many patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) undergo peripheral bypass surgery to relieve the symptom of intermittent claudication.However, measurement of graft patency alone, assessed by change in ankle blood pressure, may not adequately reflect the improvement in functional status following the operation.Fourteen patients with moderately severe intermittent claudication were evaluated before and after bypass surgery to asses changes in hemodynamics (by resting ankle-brachial indices-ABIs), exercise performance (by a graded treadmill protocol), and community-based walking ability (by a questionnaire that characterizes self-reported walking speed and distance).Six weeks after surgery, resting ABIs improved in surgical patients (from 0.56 +/- 0.09 to 0.93 +/- 0.16, P < 0.05).Peak treadmill walking time improved from 6.2 +/- 5.9 to 11.8 +/- 7.1 min (90%), peak oxygen consumption from 15.5 +/- 6.5 to 19.1 +/- 8.5 mL/kg/min (23%), and pain-free walking time from 1.5 +/- 0.4 to 6.0 5.5 min (290%).Questionnaire scores for walking distance improved by 203% and for walking speed by 130% (all P < 0.05).After twelve weeks, improvements other than pain-free walking time were maintained.Changes in peak treadmill performance or questionnaire scores were not correlated with the initial ABI, changes in ABI six or twelve weeks after surgery, or the type or extent of bypass surgery.The results demonstrate that surgical treatment of PAD, indicated for the relief of intermittent claudication, improves exercise performance and self-reported community-based walking ability.The change in functional status of the patient is an important outcome of surgery that cannot be predicted from routine noninvasive testing alone and should be measured directly.
Beneficial effects of intermittent suction and pressure treatment in intermittent claudication.The present study reports on the effects of a physical treatment modality in patients with intermittent claudication.During this treatment a major part of the skin surface is subjected to intermittent suction and pressure.In a previous, preliminary study the authors found a beneficial effect of this treatment in intermittent claudication.The study included 34 patients with moderate, stable intermittent claudication.Twenty-two patients participated in a double-blinded, randomized trial comparing the effects of 25 treatments to 25 placebo applications given over a period of two months.Twelve patients participated in an open trial investigating the possible effects of the treatment on platelet aggregation and fibrinolysis.Pain-free and maximal walking distances were measured on a treadmill, and systolic blood pressure was measured on the upper limb, the ankle, and the first toe bilaterally.The threshold for adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation was tested, and the fibrinolytic activity was estimated from the euglobulin clot lysis time.Active treatment resulted in significant improvements in pain-free and maximal walking distances, whereas no changes could be found during placebo administration.The treatment caused significant increments in the ADP thresholds for platelet aggregation, while the effects on fibrinolysis were uncertain.It is concluded that intermittent suction and pressure treatment offers a new approach for conservative treatment of intermittent claudication.
Intracardiac hemodynamics in man during short periods of head-down and head-up tilt.The intracardiac hemodynamic responses to short periods of 70 degrees head-down and head-up tilts were studied in 12 normal male subjects, ages 19-24 years.Echo-Doppler techniques were used to measure the transmitral and transaortic flow velocities as well as cardiac index, and to evaluate the peripheral impedance.Head-down tilt (HDT) rapidly induced an increase (9.7%, p < 0.05) in the early passive filling of the left ventricle (ME peak of the transmitral flow velocity curve) and in transaortic flow velocity (8%, p < 0.05), as well as in cardiac output (6%, p < 0.05).In spite of a peripheral vasodilation, the blood pressure increased (7%, p < 0.05 for the systolic;15%, p < 0.01 for the diastolic) and remained at a high level for the 5 min of the experiment.Head-up tilt (HUT) induced inverse responses;i.e., a large initial decrease in the transmitral (-15%, p < 0.05) and transaortic (-16%, p < 0.001) flows.The shape of the arterial peripheral flow indicated an increased vascular impedance.After a short drop, the blood pressure rapidly recovered a level statistically close to that of the pretest.In both cases, tachycardia occurred.We conclude that, in man, the cardiac responses to the changes in posture appear to be related more to the passive changes in ventricular filling due to the blood shift than to the nervous regulation by the arterial baroreflexes, whereas these reflexes mainly act in the control of the vascular impedance.
[Biofeedback and relaxation for patients with hypertension]We have known for decades that essential hypertension significantly contributes to many physical diseases.In most cases, hypertension results from a person's perception of stress producing events or situations.According to Greenberg, when a person is confronted by a situation or an event, the person must perceive it as either positively or negatively stressful.If it is perceived as positively stressful, a series of psychological reactions are incurred followed by physiological reactions.If these psychophysiological manifestations persist, the person is then faced with possible pathological conditions.This study attempted to support the hypothesis that people with hypertension should be able to benefit from biofeedback and relaxation techniques.Using these techniques, they will be better able to recognize and understand perceived stressful events or situations and will therefore act appropriately.The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of biofeedback, relaxation and the combination of both techniques on medically diagnosed hypertensive patients.More specifically, the study examined the following questions: What is the clients' ability to lower their blood pressure using biofeedback, relaxation and the combination of both techniques?To what capacity can clients reduce their biofeedback and relaxation training programme?Twenty-three males, aged 40 to 70 years (M = 54 years), who were registered with a cardiovascular disease prevention and rehabilitation centre, volunteered to participate in this study.For five weeks, clients trained Tuesdays and Thursdays, one hour per session.Compliance to the training programme was respected by using only those clients who had missed fewer than three of the sessions.The results showed little statistical significance.
Comparison between alprazolam and hydroxyzine for oral premedication.The safety and efficacy of alprazolam and hydroxyzine administered orally as surgical premedicants were compared in a double-blind controlled study.Sixty-five patients were given either alprazolam 1 mg or hydroxyzine 75 mg, one to two hours before surgery.Anxiety was assessed by both the patient and the anaesthetist, the patient using a visual analogue scale, the anaesthetist employing both analogue and ordinal ratings.Sedation was assessed by the anaesthetist only, using the same two methods.Amnesia was appraised with a simple memory test.Safety was assessed by recording adverse effects and measuring haemodynamic variables.Premedication with alprazolam produced a modest reduction in anxiety (28%) (P < 0.01) while hydroxyzine had no detectable effect.The comparison of the sedation level and of the memory test revealed no difference between the two premedicants.Minor side effects were only observed in the hydroxyzine group.Changes in blood pressure were more pronounced in the hydroxyzine group.This study shows that alprazolam and hydroxyzine are safe and efficient oral premedicants.However, alprazolam is preferable to hydroxyzine in terms of anxiolytic and adverse effects.
Hemodynamic and autonomic nervous system responses to mixed meal ingestion in healthy young and old subjects and dysautonomic patients with postprandial hypotension.BACKGROUND.Although postprandial hypotension is a common cause of falls and syncope in elderly persons and in patients with autonomic insufficiency, the pathophysiology of this disorder remains unknown.METHODS AND RESULTS.We examined the hemodynamic, splanchnic blood pool, plasma norepinephrine (NE), and heart rate (HR) power spectra responses to a standardized 400-kcal mixed meal in 11 healthy young (age, 26 +/- 5 years) and nine healthy elderly (age, 80 +/- 5 years) subjects and 10 dysautonomic patients with symptomatic postprandial hypotension (age, 65 +/- 16 years).Cardiac and splanchnic blood pools were determined noninvasively by radionuclide scans, and forearm vascular resistance was determined using venous occlusion plethysmography.In healthy young and old subjects, splanchnic blood volume increased, but supine blood pressure remained unchanged after the meal.In both groups, HR increased and systemic vascular resistance remained stable.Forearm vascular resistance and cardiac index increased after the meal in elderly subjects, whereas these responses were highly variable and of smaller magnitude in the young.Young subjects demonstrated postprandial increases in low-frequency HR spectral power, representing cardiac sympatho-excitation, but plasma NE remained unchanged.In elderly subjects, plasma NE increased after the meal but without changes in the HR power spectrum.Patients with dysautonomia had a large postprandial decline in blood pressure associated with no change in forearm vascular resistance, a fall in systemic vascular resistance, and reduction in left ventricular end diastolic volume index.HR increased in these patients but without changes in plasma NE or the HR power spectrum.CONCLUSIONS.1) In healthy elderly subjects, the maintenance of blood pressure homeostasis after food ingestion is associated with an increase in HR, forearm vascular resistance, cardiac index, and plasma NE.In both young and old, systemic vascular resistance is maintained.2) Dysautonomic patients with postprandial hypotension fail to maintain systemic vascular resistance after a meal.This impairment in vascular response to meal ingestion may underlie the development of postprandial hypotension.3) The measurement of mean HR or plasma NE does not adequately characterize autonomic cardiac control.Power spectral analysis suggests an impairment in the postprandial autonomic modulation of HR in healthy elderly and dysautonomic subjects, possibly predisposing to hypotension when vascular compensation is inadequate.
Echocardiographic correlates of left ventricular structure among 844 mildly hypertensive men and women in the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS).BACKGROUND.Echocardiography provides a noninvasive means of assessing left ventricular (LV) structure and evidence of LV wall remodeling in hypertensive persons.The relation of demographic, biological, and other factors with LV structure can be assessed.METHODS AND RESULTS.LV structure was assessed by M-mode echocardiograms for 511 men and 333 women with mild hypertension (average blood pressure, 140/91 mm Hg).Measurements of LV wall thicknesses and internal dimensions were made, and estimates of LV mass indexes and other derivations of structure were calculated.LV hypertrophy criteria were based on previously reported echocardiographic population studies of normal subjects.These measures were compared by age, sex, race, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive drug use, physical activity, alcohol intake, cigarette smoking, and urinary sodium excretion.Despite virtual absence of ECG-determined LV hypertrophy, 13% of men and 20% of women had echocardiographically determined LV hypertrophy indexed by body surface area (g/m2), and 24% of men and 45% of women had LV hypertrophy indexed by height (g/m).Black participants had slightly higher mean levels of wall thickness than nonblack participants but similar LV mass.Systolic blood pressure and urinary sodium excretion were significantly and independently associated with LV mass index and LV hypertrophy using both g/m2 and g/m.Body mass index was significantly related to LV mass index and LV hypertrophy using g/m.Smoking was significantly associated with LV mass index, i.e., using continuous measurement but not using the dichotomy for LV hypertrophy.CONCLUSIONS.This study of a large population of men and women with mild primary hypertension, largely without ECG evidence of LV hypertrophy, showed a substantial percentage of participants with echocardiographically determined LV hypertrophy.LV mass indexes correlated positively with systolic blood pressure, body mass index, urinary sodium excretion, and smoking.
Cyclosporin A treatment in primary biliary cirrhosis: results of a long-term placebo controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Effective treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) resulting in slower progression and improved survival remains elusive.Cyclosporin A (CyA), which has been so effective in preventing human allograft rejection, has shown promise in small numbers of patients in early studies.METHODS: Three hundred forty-nine patients with PBC were randomized to receive CyA, 3 mg.kg-1.day-1, or placebo in a multicenter study with follow-up for 6 years.The end point was death or liver transplantation.RESULTS: Cox multivariate analysis showed time from entry to death or transplantation was significantly prolonged (by up to 50%) in the CyA-treated group.Liver-related mortality was also significantly lower.However, a univariate analysis of survival showed no statistical differences between the two groups.Biochemical liver indices deteriorated more slowly in the CyA-treated group, but serum creatinine concentration was elevated > 150 mumol/L in 9%, necessitating permanent discontinuation in half of these.A reduction in the dose of CyA was required in 11% because of hypertension.CONCLUSIONS: CyA has some therapeutic potential in primary biliary cirrhosis, providing blood pressure and renal function are closely monitored.
Comparative case fatality analysis of the International Tissue Plasminogen Activator/Streptokinase Mortality Trial: variation by country beyond predictive profile.The Investigators of the International Tissue Plasminogen Activator/Streptokinase Mortality Trial.OBJECTIVES.This study was designed to examine the variation in mortality rates among countries participating in the International Tissue Plasminogen Activator/Streptokinase Mortality Trial.BACKGROUND.Despite uniform inclusion and exclusion criteria and protocol in this trial, 30-day mortality rates (irrespective of treatment allocation) ranged from 4.2% to 14.8% among the participating countries.METHODS.With use of the risk factors identified by a multi-variate logistic model, the total study group was classified into deciles on the basis of each patient's risk profile and individual probability of dying within 30 days.Expected mortality rates were then calculated and compared with actual mortality for each decile of the total study group, as well as for patients from each country.RESULTS.Independent risk factors for mortality were older age (odds ratio 1.97 for each 10-year increment), systolic hypotension (blood pressure < 95 mm Hg) at entry (odds ratio 3.7), Killip class > 1 at entry (odds ratio 3.5), history of antecedent angina (odds ratio 1.23 to 1.49), history of diabetes mellitus (odds ratio 1.64), previous infarction (odds ratio 1.23) and history of never smoking (odds ratio 1.37).The overall mortality rate among the 1,612 patients in risk deciles 9 and 10 was 26%;for the 1,606 patients in deciles 1 and 2 it was 1.2%, with a sensitivity of 58.6% and a specificity of 83.7%.The logistic model closely predicted and explained the different mortality rates for most countries (the differences between expected and actual mortality were nonsignificant).However, in the total study group, the difference between the expected and actual mortality was significant (p < 0.001).This difference was mainly ascribed to the two countries with the highest and lowest mortality rates.When the patients from these two countries were excluded from the analysis, the overall difference became nonsignificant.CONCLUSIONS.These findings suggest that the recognized risk factors associated with increased case fatality in acute myocardial infarction account only in part for mortality differences across or within populations.
Effect of increases in heart rate and arterial pressure on coronary flow reserve in humans.OBJECTIVES.The objective of this study was to determine the effect of increases in heart rate and arterial pressure on maximal pharmacologic coronary blood flow reserve.BACKGROUND.Coronary flow reserve measurements are useful in assessment of the physiologic significance of coronary lesions.However, animal studies suggest that alterations in hemodynamic status may influence coronary flow reserve independent of coronary stenosis.METHODS.Coronary flow reserve was measured during cardiac catheterization with the use of a 3F coronary Doppler catheter and intracoronary papaverine.Flow reserve was measured under control conditions and during increases in heart rate produced by atrial pacing (18 patients) or during elevation of arterial pressure by intravenous phenylephrine infusion (9 patients) with intracoronary alpha-adrenergic blockade by phentolamine.RESULTS.Coronary flow reserve progressively decreased from 3.7 +/- 0.9 (mean +/- SD) at the rate of 71 +/- 8 beats/min at rest to 3.0 +/- 0.6 during pacing at 100 beats/min and to 2.6 +/- 0.5 during pacing at 120 beats/min.Flow reserve decreased because of a progressive increase in rest coronary flow velocity during pacing (122 +/- 16% of control value at 100 beats/min, 139 +/- 16% of control value at 120 beats/min), whereas papaverine hyperemia peak velocity remained unchanged.Flow reserve decreased with pacing tachycardia whether the initial flow reserve was normal or depressed.Mean arterial pressure increased from 95 +/- 12 mm Hg to 130 +/- 8 mm Hg during intravenous phenylephrine infusion and to 123 +/- 10 mm Hg during combined intravenous phenylephrine and intracoronary phentolamine infusions.Coronary flow reserve was not affected by the blood pressure increases (control value 4.3 +/- 1.0, phenylephrine 4.4 +/- 1.5, phenylephrine and phentolamine 4.4 +/- 2.0).CONCLUSIONS.Sudden increases in heart rate but not mean arterial pressure lead to a substantial reduction in maximal coronary blood flow reserve.These data suggest that the diagnostic utility of all flow reserve measurement techniques might be improved by standardization of heart rate during measurement or extrapolation of the measured flow reserve to that expected at a reference heart rate.
Endogenous prostaglandin endoperoxides may alter infarct size in the presence of thromboxane synthase inhibition: studies in a rabbit model of coronary artery occlusion-reperfusion.OBJECTIVES.The aim of this study was to assess whether prostaglandin endoperoxides, which continue to be formed in the setting of thromboxane A2 synthase inhibition, might influence the fate of ischemic myocardium in a model of coronary occlusion and reperfusion.BACKGROUND.It was recently demonstrated that thromboxane A2 synthase inhibitors reduce ischemic myocardial injury through a redirection of prostaglandin (PG) endoperoxides toward the synthesis of However, part of these prostaglandin endoperoxides may also stimulate a receptor, shared with thromboxane A2, mediating platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.METHODS.New Zealand White rabbits were subjected to 30 min of coronary occlusion, followed by 5.5 h of reperfusion.Fifteen minutes before reperfusion, the animals were randomized to receive 1) saline solution (control animals, n = 8);2) SQ 29548, a potent and selective thromboxane A2/PGH2 receptor antagonist (n = 8);3) dazoxiben, a selective thromboxane A2 synthase inhibitor (n = 8);4) R 68070 (Ridogrel), a drug with dual thromboxane A2 synthase-inhibiting and thromboxane A2/PGH2 receptor-blocking properties (n = 8);or 5) aspirin + R 68070 (n = 8).RESULTS.Dazoxiben and R 68070, but not SQ 29548, significantly reduced thromboxane B2 formation and increased plasma levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGE2 and PGF2 alpha.Ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by U46619 (a thromboxane A2 mimetic) was inhibited by SQ 29548 and R 68070 but not by dazoxiben.In control animals, infarct size determined at the end of the experiment by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining averaged 57.7 +/- 3.2% of the area at risk of infarction.The administration of SQ 29548 did not significantly reduce infarct size compared with that in control animals, whereas dazoxiben and R 68070 significantly reduced infarct size to 36.7 +/- 2.8% and 16.6 +/- 3.6% of area at risk of infarction, respectively (p < 0.001 vs. control values).In rabbits treated with R 68070, infarct size was also significantly smaller than that of dazoxiben-treated rabbits (p < 0.01).This protective effect of R 68070 was completely abolished when the drug was administered with aspirin, infarct size in this group averaging 59.7 +/- 1.6% (p = NS vs. control values).No differences in regional myocardial blood flow, systemic blood pressure, heart rate or extent of area at risk were observed among groups.CONCLUSIONS.Thus, prostaglandin endoperoxides play an important role in modulating the cardioprotective effects of thromboxane A2 synthase inhibitors.The simultaneous inhibition of thromboxane A2 synthase and blockade of thromboxane A2/PGH2 receptors by R 68070 identify a pharmacologic interaction of potential therapeutic importance.
Bilateral testicular adrenal rests in a patient with 11-hydroxylase deficient congenital adrenal hyperplasia.A 13-year-old boy was referred for investigation of hypertension, precocious puberty and giant testicles.Hormonal studies established the diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-hydroxylase deficiency.Testicular biopsy revealed that the scrotal masses were adrenal rest tumors entirely composed of adrenocortical tissue.Primary testicular tissue was absent.The size of the tumors regressed following replacement steroid therapy together with restoration of normal blood pressure.This observation of a testicular adrenal rest tumor in a patient with 11-hydroxylase deficient congenital adrenal hyperplasia is unique.
