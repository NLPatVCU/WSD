=head1 NAME

mm2arff.pl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Creates arff files required by the weka data mining packages.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Takes as input the CuiTools xml-like .mm format and extracts
specified features based on the following options from the data
set and outputs an arff format to be used by the WEKA data mining 
package for supervised word sense disambiguation.    

=head1 USAGE

perl mm2arff.pl [OPTIONS] DESTINATION SOURCE

=head1 INPUT

=head2 Required Arguments:

=head3 SOURCE

The CuiTools xml-like .mm formatted file.

=head3 DESTINATION

The output file.

=head2 Optional Arguments:

$=head3 --test    

This option allows for arff files to be created for both the test 
data and the training data. The features for this will only 
be extracted from the test data

=head3 --key FILE
The program will obtain the answers to the given test file from the 
key file. The key file is expected to be in the same format as the 
Senseval-2 key file.

    Example:

    art art.40003 pop_art%1:06:00::
        <target word> <instance id> <sense>


=head3 --nokey

There is no key for the test file. The answers will be replaced with a 
question mark (?).

=head3 --pos

The part of speech of the words surrounding the target word

=head3 --head

Whether the target word is the head word of its phrase.

=head3 --ngramcount "OPTIONS" or FILE

The words surrounding the target word as features 

The Ngram Statistic Package (NSP) count.pl program is used to obtain 
the counts. The options specify any additional options to be passed 
to count.pl program.
                 
Note: All the options must be within double quotes, as
      would be passed to the program at command line.

Note: If the --sentence option is defined, the surrounding 
words will come from the sentence that contains the target 
word. If the --phrase option is defined, the surrounding owrds 
will come only from the phrase that contains the target word. 
Otherwise they come from the abstract.

=head3 --ngrammeasure "OPTIONS" 

Specifies a measure of association to be used with the statistic.pl 
program in the Ngram Statistics Package which is used in combination 
with the --ngramstat option to perform feature selection for the 
--ngramcount option

Note: All the options must be within double quotes, as
      would be passed to the program at command line.

=head3 --ngramstat "OPTIONS"
                 
Specifies any additional options to be passed to statistic.pl program 
when using --ngramcount and --ngrammeasure options

Note: All the options must be within double quotes, as
      would be passed to the program at command line.

=head3 --cuicount "OPTIONS"

Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Concept Unique Identifiers 
(CUIs) of the words surrounding the target word.

The Ngram Statistic Package (NSP) is used to obtain the counts.

The options specify any additional options to be passed to count.pl
program.
                 
Note: All the options must be within double quotes, as
      would be passed to the program at command line.

Note: If the --sentence option is defined, the surrounding 
words will come from the sentence that contains the target 
word. If the --phrase option is defined, the surrounding owrds 
will come only from the phrase that contains the target word. 
Otherwise they come from the abstract.

=head3 --cuimeasure "OPTIONS"

Specifies a measure of association to be used with the statistic.pl 
program in the Ngram Statistics Package which is used in combination 
with the --cuistat option to perform feature selection for the 
--cuicount option

Note: All the options must be within double quotes, as
      would be passed to the program at command line.

=head3 --cuistats "OPTIONS"
                 
Specifies any additional options to be passed to statistic.pl program 
when using --ngramcount and --ngrammeasure options

Note: All the options must be within double quotes, as
      would be passed to the program at command line.

=head3 --firstranked

The first CUI in the set of one or more CUIs found in the mapping 
(that have the highest MTI score) is used as the feature rather 
than all of them (which is the default).

=head3 --conflatedcuis

Combine all the CUIS in the set of one or more CUIs found in the 
mapping into one sorted string and use the string as a feature

=head3 --stcount "OPTIONS"

The words surrounding the target word as features 

The Ngram Statistic Package (NSP) count.pl program is used to obtain 
the counts. The options specify any additional options to be passed 
to count.pl program.
                 
Note: All the options must be within double quotes, as
      would be passed to the program at command line.

Note: If the --sentence option is defined, the surrounding 
words will come from the sentence that contains the target 
word. If the --phrase option is defined, the surrounding owrds 
will come only from the phrase that contains the target word. 
Otherwise they come from the abstract.

=head3 --stmeasure "OPTIONS"

Specifies a measure of association to be used with the statistic.pl 
program in the Ngram Statistics Package which is used in combination 
with the --ststat option to perform feature selection for the 
--stcount option

Note: All the options must be within double quotes, as
      would be passed to the program at command line.

=head3 --ststats "OPTIONS"
                 
                 
Specifies any additional options to be passed to statistic.pl program 
when using --ngramcount and --ngrammeasure options

Note: All the options must be within double quotes, as
      would be passed to the program at command line.

=head3 --nspconfig FILE

This is can be used in replace of or in conjunction with the 
ngramcount, ngrammeasure, ngramstat, cuicount, cuimeasure, 
cuistat, stcount, stmeasure and ststat options. It allows 
for multiple instances of ngramcount, cuicount and stcount 
to be called in order to allow for multiple ngrams to be 
used as features. 

An example of the format required for the configuration 
file is as follows:

ngramcount::
count:: --ngram 3 --remove 3
statistic:: ll.pm --score 3.841

ngramcount::
count:: --ngram 2 --remove 1

cuicount::
count:: --ngram 2 --remove 3
statistic:: ll.pm --score 3.841

stcount::
count:: --ngram 1 --remove 3

=head3 --relation 

The semantic relation of the semantic type of the target word and 
the semantic types s of the words surrounding the target word. 
The relations are read in from a file which is located in the 
'default_options' directory. The name of the file is called 
'relation'. The relations comes from the UMLS 2007AC documentation.


If you would like to provide your own, the format of the file 
is as follows:

    semantic_type relation semantic_type

where each semantic type pair and relation are on their own line. 

For example:

    acab affects virs
    acab affects vtbt
    acap affects rept
    ...
    ...

=head3 --mesh

Uses the MeSH terms assigned to the abstract containing the 
target word as features

=head3 --punc

Removes unigrams that contain only punctuation from the list 
of features.

=head3 --lc

Lowercases all the words for the --ngramcount option

=head3 --phrase

The context considered is only the features that are in the 
same phrase as the target word. The phrases are identified 
by MetaMap.

Note: If the phrase option is set then the --sentence and 
--line options need to be off.

=head3 --sentence

The context considered is only the features that are in the 
same sentence as the target word.

Note: If the sentence option is set then the --phrase and 
--line options need to be off.

=head3 --line

The context considered is the features that are in the 
the complete line as defined by the .mm file as the 
target word.

Note: If the line option is set then the --sentence and 
--phrase options need to be off.

Note: This is the default option.

=head3 --binary

Uses a binary indicator to represent whether a feature exists. DEFAULT

=head3 --freq

Uses the frequency count of a feature to represent its existance.

=head3 --stop FILE

Stoplist for the count.pl program. This can also be added in 
the --ngramcount option but I wanted to add it here as well 
in case people were not as familiar with NSP.

==head3 --idfstop DIR

This is the directory that contains the idf stoplists for 
each of the target words. The directory should contain 
a file called:

     <target word>.idf.stop

foreach target word file.

=head3 --debug  

Sets the debug option on

=head3 --log DIRECTORY

Directory to contain temporary and log files. DEFAULT: mm2arff.log

=head3 --help

Displays the quick summary of program options.

=head3 --version

Displays the version information.

=head1 OUTPUT

mm2arff.pl creates one file in arff format. This file can be used as input 
training data to the WEKA data mining package.

=head1 THE .arff FORMAT

See L<README.arff.format.pod>
