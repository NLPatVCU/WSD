=head1 NAME

text2sval.pl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Converts a plain text instance data file into a Senseval-2 formatted XML file.

=head1 USGAE

text2sval.pl [OPTIONS] TEXT

=head1 INPUT

=head2 Required Arguments:

=head3 TEXT

Should be a plain text data file containing context of a single instance on each
line. In other words, contexts of different instances should be separated by
a newline character and there should not be any newline characters within the
context of a single instance. 

e.g. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

 market capitalization draws a <head>line</head> between big and small stocks

 volunteers using a dozen telephone <head>lines</head> at the group's washington headquarters this week will be urging members in alabama arizona

 he proceeded briskly through a reception <head>line</head> of party officials and old friends

--------------------------------------------------------------------

shows 3 instances with context of each instance on each line.

=head2 Optional Arguments:

=head4 --lexelt LEX

Specifies the value of the <lexelt> item tag to be used in the output 
Senseval-2 file.

=head4 --key KEYFILE

Displays the instance ids and optional sense tags of the instances in the TEXT
file. These will be used as the values of the <instance> and <sense> tags in 
the output Senseval-2 file.

Each line in KEYFILE should show the instance id and optional sense tags of 
the instance displayed on the corresponding line in the TEXT file, in the 
format -

	<instance id=\"IID\"\/> [<sense id=\"SID\"\/>]*

where an <instance> tag is followed by zero or more <sense> tags.

=head3 Other Options :

=head4 --help

Displays this message.

=head4 --version

Displays the version information.

=head1 OUTPUT

Given TEXT input file is converted to a Senseval-2 formatted XML file that 
is displayed on stdout.

Sample Outputs 

=over

=item 1 No options specified

Input TEXT file => input.text

 ------------------------------------------------------------------

STDOUT will display =>

 ---------------------------------------------------------------

Notice that -

1. Since the instance ids are not provided (via --key KEYFILE), text2sval uses 
ordinal numbers 
0,1,2 ... etc as the instance ids for the instances in the same order
i.e. Instance id assigned to instance at position i in the TEXT file is (i-1)

2. Since the sense tags are not provided, all instances are assigned tag 'NOTAG'

3. Since --lexelt is not provided, value of <lexelt> tag shows LEXELT i.e. as
 <lexelt item=\"LEXELT\">

=item 2 --key KEY is provided and KEY shows only the instance ids 

In this case, text2sval uses instance ids from KEY file as the values of 
instance ids in <instance> and <answer> tags while sense ids will have 
values NOTAG

For TEXT file in example (1), 

if the KEY file is => serve.key

 <instance id="serve-v.aphb_34700303_2142"/> 
 <instance id="serve-v.aphb_51903174_3841"/> 
 <instance id="serve-v.aphb_51903399_3856"/> 
 <instance id="serve-v.w7_022806_525"/> 

Command => text2sval.pl --key serve.key --lexelt serve-v input.text

will display on stdout =>

 <corpus lang="english">

 </corpus>

 --------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the instance ids are taken from the KEY file while sense ids have
NOTAGs.

=item 3 KEY file contains both the instance and sense tags

For TEXT file in example (1), 

if the KEY file is => serve.key

 <instance id="serve-v.aphb_34700303_2142"/> <sense id="SERVE10"/>
 <instance id="serve-v.aphb_51903174_3841"/> <sense id="SERVE10"/>

 <instance id="serve-v.w7_022806_525"/> <sense id="SERVE2"/>

Command => text2sval.pl --key serve.key --lexelt serve-v input.text 

will display on STDOUT =>
