=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Prerequisites

CuiTools REQUIRES that the following software and data set to be 
download and installed. Now having stated that the following is 
required if you would like to run all the programs in CuiTools. 
If you are only interested in running the supervised or unsupervised
portions of CuiTools, I have annotated which software and data is 
needed for each of them.

More details on how to obtain and install appear below. 

--Programming Languages

--Data (Optional)

  - Not required at all 
    NLM-WSD data set (PMID Version)
    Senseval data  

Remember there are ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES that need to be set for 
these packages. Remember to set the following ones:

    1. CUITOOLSHOME
    2. WEKAHOME
    3. METAMAP_PATH
    4. NLMWSDHOME

For example:

  # in cshell
  setenv CUITOOLSHOME /home/btmcinnes/CuiTools

  # in bash
  export CUITOOLSHOME=/home/btmcinnes/CuiTools

This can be added to your .cshrc or .bashrc file

=head2 Installing

If you have the super-user access, then you can install CuiTools 
into system directories via :
		perl Makefile.PL
		make
		make install
	 	make clean

The exact location of where CuiTools will be installed depends
on your system configuration. A message will be printed out after
make install telling your exactly where it was installed. 

 You will often need root access/superuser privileges to run
make install. The module can also be installed locally. To do a local
install, you need to specify a PREFIX option when you run 'perl
Makefile.PL'. For example,

 perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/btmcinnes

or

 perl Makefile.PL LIB=/home/btmcinnes/lib PREFIX=/home/btmcinnes

will install UMLS-Interface into /home/btmcinnes. The first method above 
will install the modules in /home/btmcinnes/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3 
(assuming you are using version 5.8.3 of Perl; otherwise, the 
directory will be slightly different). The second method will 
install the modules in /home/btmcinnes/lib. In either case the executable 
scripts will be installed in /home/btmcinnes/bin and the man pages will 
be installed in home/btmcinnes/share.

Warning: do not put a dash or hyphen in front of PREFIX, LIB or WNHOME.

In your perl programs that you may write using the modules, you may need
to add a line like so

 use lib '/home/btmcinnes/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3';

if you used the first method or

 use lib '/home/btmcinnes/lib';

if you used the second method. By doing this, the installed modules are
found by your program. To run supervised-disambiguate.pl program, you would need
to do

 perl -I/home/btmcinnes/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3 supervised-disambiguate.pl

or

 perl -I/home/btmcinnes/lib

Of course, you could also add the 'use lib' line to the top of the
program yourself, but you might not want to do that. You will need to
replace 5.8.3 with whatever version of Perl you are using. The
preceding instructions should be sufficient for standard and slightly
non-standard installations. However, if you need to modify other
makefile options you should look at the ExtUtils::MakeMaker
documentation. Modifying other makefile options is not recommended
unless you really, absolutely, and completely know what you're doing!

NOTE: If one (or more) of the tests run by 'make test' fails, you will
see a summary of the tests that failed, followed by a message of the
form "make: *** [test_dynamic] Error Y" where Y is a number between 1
and 255 (inclusive). If the number is less than 255, then it indicates
how many test failed (if more than 254 tests failed, then 254 will still
be shown). If one or more tests died, then 255 will be shown. For more
details, see:

http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Simple/lib/Test/Builder.pm#EXIT_CODES


Once Downloaded the environment variable CUITOOLSHOME needs to be set to 

For example:

  # in cshell
  setenv CUITOOLSHOME /home/btmcinnes/CuiTools

  # in bash
  export CUITOOLSHOME=/home/btmcinnes/CuiTools

This can be added to your .cshrc or .bashrc file

=head2 System Requirements

=head3 Programming Languages

=over 

=item 1.

Perl version 5.8 or later. 

This is required for unsupervised and supervised disambiguation.

Perl is freely available at http://www.perl.org. It is very likely 
that you will already have Perl installed if you are using a 
Unix/Linux based system. 

=item 2.

Perl Data Language (version 2.4.1 or better)

This is required to use unsupervised-disambiguate.pl.

CuiTools uses the Perl Data Language (PDL) for efficient   
computations and storage of high dimensional data structures.

It is available at: http://search.cpan.org/dist/PDL/

Note that if you have supervisor access on your machine, and have the 
MCPAN Perl module available, you can install PDL automatically via:

perl -MCPAN -e shell
> install PDL

If you do not have supervisor access, you will need to install this
module locally. Note that you can configure the CPAN module to install 
locally by setting PREFIX and LIB options to directories you have read 
write authority over. 

Note that PDL has quite a few dependencies, and can be tricky to 
install. You may want to check with your system adminstrator and see
if they can install on your behalf before you tackle the local
install of PDL. All the other code mentioned here can be locally 
installed quite routinely. 

This is a good description of how to do local installs of Perl modules:
http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/04/10/mod_perl.html

=head3 CPAN Modules

=over 

=item 1.

Ngram Statistics Package (version 1.01 or better). 

This is required for unsupervised and supervised disambiguation.

CuiTools uses Text-NSP to select a variety of lexical features. 
Text-NSP is freely available at http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-NSP/

perl -MCPAN -e shell
> install Text::NSP

or manual installation (http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/nsp.html)

=item 2. 

LWP::Simple

This is required to use supervised-disambiguate.pl

It is available at: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Math-SparseVector/

perl -MCPAN -e shell
> install LWP::Simple

or manual installation. 

=item 3. 

Config::Simple

This is required to use supervised-disambiguate.pl

It is available at: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Config-Simple/

perl -MCPAN -e shell
> install Config::Simple

or manual installation. 

=item 4. 

Math::SparseVector (version 0.03 or better). 

This is required to use unsupervised-disambiguate.pl.

This is a Perl module that implements sparse vector operations. 

It is available at: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Math-SparseVector/

perl -MCPAN -e shell
> install Math::SparseVector

or manual installation. 

=item 5. 

Math::SparseMatrix (version 0.01 or better). 

This is required for unsupervised-disambiguate.pl

This is a Perl module that implements sparse matrix operations, 
in particular the sparse matrix transpose operation. 

It is available at: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Math-SparseMatrix/

perl -MCPAN -e shell
> install Math::SparseMatrix

or manual installation.


=item 6.

UMLS::Interface

This is required for unsupervised-disambiguate.pl

This is a Perl module that connects to the Unified Medical Language 
System (UMLS) stored in a mysql database. If you do not have the 
UMLS in a mysql database, the package contains instructions on how 
to go about doing this. 

It is available at: http://search.cpan.org/dist/UMLS-Interface

Otherwise, you can install as follows.

perl -MCPAN -e shell
> install UMLS::Interface

=head3 Other Packages

=over

=item 1.

WEKA Data Mining Package. 

This is required to use supervised-disambiguate.pl.

Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining 
tasks. CuiTools uses Weka's machine learning algorithms to perform 
supervised word sense disambiguation. Weka is freely available at 

	   http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ 

IMPORTANT:

Once downloaded and installed remember to set the environment variable 
WEKAHOME and add WEKAHOME/weka.jar to your CLASSPATH. This is required 
by Weka as well as CuiTools.

For example:

  # in cshell
  setenv WEKAHOME /home/btmcinnes/weka/weka-3-5-3
  setenv CLASSPATH $WEKAHOME/weka.jar:$CLASSPATH

  # in bash
  export WEKAHOME=/home/btmcinnes/weka/weka-3-5-3
  export CLASSPATH=$WEKAHOME/weka.jar:$CLASSPATH

This can be added to your .cshrc or .bashrc file

=item 2.


MetaMap 

This is required to use unsupervised-disambiguate.pl - 
or if you would like to use the NLM-WSD dataset with the MetaMap
assigned CUIs - see program nlm2mm.pl

MetaMap is a freely available from the National Library of Medicine. 
MetaMap maps text to concepts in the UMLS Metathesaurus. The program 
parses the text into components including sentences, paragraphs, phrases, 
lexical elements and tokens. It then identifies possible UMLS concepts 
and chooses the best possible mapping. The information that CuiTools 
uses from MetaMap is the sentence, phrase, and token information, part 
of speech and head information of each token, the possible UMLS concepts, 
the final final mapping concepts and the semantic types associated with 
each concept.

MetaMap can be downloaded from:

     http://metamap.nlm.nih.gov

Although MetaMap is free, in order to download this you need to register. 
You can register at: 
	 http://umlsks.nlm.nih.gov

To download:

When you get to the MetaMap web page, click on the link "Download". Scroll 
down and you will see tar.bz2 files that can be downloaded and installed.
Click on the 2008 version (not the 2007) for your operating system. MetaMap 
is currently only available for Linux and Solaris. If you are a windows 
users, there is the MetaMap Transfer program which can be used instead.

Once downloaded, go to the installation instructions located here:

     http://metamap.nlm.nih.gov/#Installation

Note: downloading takes a while (at least it did for me).

IMPORTANT:

Once Downloaded the remember to set the environment variable METAMAP_PATH  
to the /bin level directory that store the MetaMap programs just downloaded.
This is required by MetaMap as well as CuiTools.

For example:

  # in cshell
  setenv METAMAP_PATH /home/btmcinnes/metamap/public_mm/bin


  # in bash
  export METAMAP_PATH=/home/btmcinnes/metamap/public_mm/bin

This can be added to your .cshrc or .bashrc file

NOTE: 

The MetaMap command used by this program is:

    metamap08 -q InputFile OutputFile

=head3 Data (Optional)

=over

=item 1.

NLM-WSD Data Set. The National Library of Medicine's Word Sense 
Disambiguation (NLM-WSD) dataset \cite{WeeberMA01}. The dataset 
was created to promote the study of WSD in the biomedical domain. 
It contains 50 highly frequent ambiguous CUIs from the 1998 MEDLINE 
abstracts. Each ambiguous word in the dataset contains 100 ambiguous 
instances randomly selected. The instances were manually disambiguated 
by 11 evaluators who assigned the ambiguous word to a CUI or ``None'' 
if none of the CUIs described the sense. 

The NLM-WSD data set can be downloaded from:

    http://wsd.nlm.nih.gov

Although the data set is free, in order to download this you need to register. 
You can register at: 	 
    http://umlsks.nlm.nih.gov

To download:

When you get to the NLM-WSD data set web page, click on the link "Access 
WSD Test Collection (Restricted)"; this is where you need to be registered.

NOTE: There are two versions of the NLM-WSD data set: USE THE PMID VERSION!
So click on "Switch to PMID identification version of the WSD Test Collection".

There are three files that need to be downloaded. 

The first in the "Basic Test Collection":
    1. Basic Reviewed Set

The second and third in the "Full Test Collection":
    2. Common Files
    3. Full Reviewed Result Set

Unpack the files in a directory called NLM-WSD (for example - you can call 
it anything you would like). You should end up with three directories 
in the NLM-WSD directory:
    1. Basic_Reviewed_Results
    2. common
    3. Reviewed_Results


IMPORTANT:

Once Downloaded the environment variable NLMWSDHOME needs to be set.

For example:

  # in cshell
  setenv NLMWSDHOME /home/btmcinnes/NLM-WSD

  # in bash
  export NLMWSDHOME=/home/btmcinnes/NLM-WSD

This can be added to your .cshrc or .bashrc file

=item 1.

Senseval Data set. 

Senseval, now called Semeval, are evaluation exercises for the semantic 
analysis of text. One such exercises is word sense disambiguation. The 
Senseval data can be used by the CuiTools package. The data from the 
senseval/semeval evaluations can be download from the senseval website:

		 http://www.senseval.org

Alternatively, Senseval 1, 2 and 3 data can be downloaded in various formats 
from:
             http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/data.html
