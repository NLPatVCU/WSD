=head1 Synopsis

This file briefly describes the ARFF format used by the WEKA datamining 
package.

=head1 ARFF Format


The .arff format is required by the WEKA data mining package to perform 
supervised learning. An example of the .arff format when running mm2arff.pl 
on the above .mm format example with the cui option (mm2arff.pl --cui ex.arff 
ex.mm) is as follows:

@RELATION art
@ATTRIBUTE Name NUMERIC
@ATTRIBUTE Magazine NUMERIC
@ATTRIBUTE Top NUMERIC
@ATTRIBUTE Collectors NUMERIC
@ATTRIBUTE Sense {art}
@DATA
1,1,1,1,art


The @RELATION tag indicates the attribute of the data set. In this case 
we are trying to identify the sense of the word art.

The @ATTRIBUTE <cui> NUMERIC indicates that there is an attribute 
which in this case is a specific cui and it takes a NUMERIC value. In 
our case 1 or 0 depending on if that cui exists in the same context 
as the target word. You can have multiple attributes. The attributes 
in the arff file are determined by the user defined options for this 
program.

The @ATTRIBUTE Sense tag is always there. This indicates the possible 
senses for all the instances in the data set. Since we were looking 
at only one instance, we have only one possible sense ("art"). Normally 
there would be multiple senses, like {art,art_gallery}. The senses 
are delimited by a comma.

The @DATA indicates that all the instances with their corresponding 
features and sense are below.

So "1,1,1,1,art" indicates for this instance the cui's "Name", "Magazine", 
"Top", and "Collectors" all exist surrounding the target word and the 
sense of this instance is "art".
