pubovaginal sling using cadaveric allograft fascia for the treatment of intrinsic sphincter deficiency [see pubovaginal sling is the definitive management of female stress urinary incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter autologous fascia has been although synthetic material has its harvesting autologous fascia at surgery is associated with postoperative and synthetic material has a history of infection and to assess whether allograft fascia is free from these we retrospectively compared the outcome of women undergoing pubovaginal sling using either autologous or cadaveric allograft materials and we reviewed our experience during the last 28 months with patients treated with the pubovaginal sling for intrinsic sphincter all patients underwent preoperative video the outcome was assessed using the seapi scoring special attention was devoted to local sling operative time and length of hospital stay were compared between patients with allograft and autograft pubovaginal a total of 92 women (mean age 60 years) underwent allograft (59) or autograft (33) pubovaginal preoperative such as percent of patients who had had previous incontinence mean leak point pressure and seapi incontinence were similar in both mean followup was months (range 1 to 28) for the overall the seapi scoring system showed that patients were markedly with no significant difference between the allograft and autograft allograft and autograft pubovaginal slings were equally well and no infection or erosion was mean operative time and hospital stay were significantly shorter when using allograft compared to autograft the success rates of allograft and autograft pubovaginal sling were equally and no complications related to the cadaveric origin of the allograft fascia were allograft pubovaginal sling was well and its use significantly shortened operative time and hospital
[symptomatic lithiasic biliary comparison between men and women undergoing a prospective survey was carried out in 205 males and 667 females who had their gallbladder removed for gallstone disease during 1989 at a general hospital in females had a greater prevalence of disease with an earlier appearance of symptoms leading to surgery at a younger in males developed a more aggressive form of the with a shorter interval from appearance of symptoms and
radical surgery for early gastric the role of radical surgery for early gastric cancer has become a topic of considerable despite excellent results from japan and several retrospective and uncontrolled results from two large prospective randomized trials appear to demonstrate no benefit from d2 compared to the d1 these trials have prompted a move away from radical lymph-node we argue that this reasoning is flawed and based not on the lack of efficacy of the d2 resection but in an attempt to reduce post-operative mortality and post-operative complications are largely a result of distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy and the relative inexperience of surgeons performing the by preserving these organs and concentrating surgery to specialized centres the complication rate of radical surgery can be significantly reduced to approximate that of non-radical lymph-node metastasis to the n2 nodes in early gastric cancer has been shown to be as high as non-radical surgery poses significant risks of leaving residual radical surgery must remain the operation of choice if non-curative surgery for a curable condition is to be
a surgical option for familial chylomicronemia associated with insulin-resistant diabetes the goal of the present work is to present an effective surgical approach for the treatment of a medically-resistant form of two siblings with familial lipoprotein-lipase deficiency and subsequent widespread skin xanthomas and severe insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus came to our observation after several unsuccessful attempts at medical in order to lower plasma lipids through lipid a modified bilio-pancreatic diversion operation was the rationale in deciding to use this surgical approach was based also on the likely hypothesis that in these was secondary to high circulating and tissue levels of insulin sensitivity in the two treated as well as in 24 healthy volunteers constituting the control was assessed by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp and indirect obtaining total end-clamp glucose uptake (m) and end-clamp glucose oxidation (ecgo) within 3 weeks of plasma triglycerides and cholesterol levels had decreased from 4500 and 500 mg/dl (with dietary restrictions) to lower than 450 and 150 mg/dl (on a lipid-rich diet) fasting plasma glucose levels had decreased from above 300 (under daily repeated subcutaneous injections of insulin) to 80-100 mg/dl (without administration of insulin or oral hypoglycemic body weight and fat free mass were maintained in both subjects after in both before surgery m and ecgo were significantly lower than in normal while after surgery they were not significantly different from normal confirming the positive metabolic effect of the the surgical option used in these patients may represent an interesting and effective new possibility for treatment of those severe cases of hyperlipemia leading otherwise to metabolic complications and a low quality of
outcome of gastric restriction psychiatric and weight losses following bariatric surgery have varied depending on length of follow-up and various pre-surgical characteristics of patients undergoing one hundred thirty one patients had a detailed presurgical psychiatric patients were assessed clinically for 2 years after surgery and at follow-up a mean of years after mean presurgical body mass index (bmi) was many patients had two-thirds of the patients were located a mean of years after the mean change in bmi at follow-up was 25% and the mean weight loss was one-third had excellent or good weight outcomes using the griffen five patients had died by there was no relationship between or fat content presurgically and weight loss at although presurgical weight was associated with greater weight loss at weight regain began 2 years after there was no relationship between the presence or absence of a presurgical psychiatric diagnosis and weight loss at there was also no relationship between the presence of a presurgical psychiatric diagnosis and various mental health parameters at satisfaction with the surgery was marginally associated with weight loss but significantly associated with improved mental and physical mean weight losses were less than have been previously reported with gastric restriction procedures but the follow-up was longer than usually reported and many patients had prior to the implications of for weight loss are
emotional distress before coronary bypass grafting limits the benefits of the inclusion of heterogeneous groups of patients for coronary bypass grafting (cabg) surgery has resulted in a more mixed treatment thus it becomes important to identify patients who are less likely to benefit from surgery or who may require additional support to improve treatment the aim of the present study was to examine whether psychological status measured before cabg can contribute to prediction of short- and long-term outcomes of the methods and one hundred seventy-one consecutive patients from two large university hospitals in stockholm completed a psychosocial questionnaire before being scheduled for one year after patients again completed the follow-up of medical charts was conducted during the first 3 years after all major cardiac events (cardiac definite myocardial and unstable angina verified by angiography or myocardial scintigraphy) were although the overall effect of surgery was excellent in the majority of the patients exhibiting a high degree of distress and tiredness) before surgery assessed their status as being much worse both before the operation and at the 1-year equally important was the fact that patients considered distressed before surgery had significantly higher rates of cardiac events (16%) in the 3-year follow-up period compared with nondistressed patients (5%) degrees of p < systematic evaluation and treatment of emotional distress in the candidates for coronary revascularization may be expected to result in more optimal subjective results and a reduction in the number of serious cardiac events after
