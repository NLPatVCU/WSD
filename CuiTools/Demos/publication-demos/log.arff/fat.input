beta-casomorphins stimulate and enterostatin inhibits the intake of dietary fat in the effects of beta-casomorphins 1-5 and 1-4 on food intake of rats adapted to either a high fat (hf) or high carbohydrate (hc) diet have been studied and compared to the effects of intracerebroventricular (icv) beta-casomorphin1-7 (beta-cm1-7) stimulated intake of hf diet in overnight fasted but beta-cm1-5 and beta-cm1-4 were peripheral injection of beta-cm1-7 also increased the intake of a high fat but reduced the intake of hc diet in satiated intracerebroventricular (icv) beta-cm1-7 caused a dose-dependent increase in the intake of hf but a dose-dependent inhibition of hc ingestion in satiated enterostatin (icv) inhibited the beta-cm1-7 stimulation of hf as did the general opioid antagonist ligand binding studies with [3h-pro] enterostatin identified on low affinity binding site (kd 100nm) on a crude brain membrane this binding was displaced by beta-cm1-5 and these data suggest that at high doses enterostatin and beta-cm1-7 may interact with the same low affinity receptor to modulate intake of dietary
glucose-fatty acid interactions in health and it is widely held that although obesity and type 2 diabetes are polygenic in the primary defect causing both conditions is insulin which in turn gives rise to a constellation of other including glucose and (in the genetically predisposed) frank explored here is an albeit scenario in which hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance arise either simultaneously or sequentially from some preexisting defect within the leptin signaling in either a central component of the model is that the breakdown of glucose homeostasis that is characteristic of the condition of obesity with type 2 diabetes is secondary to disturbances in lipid the possibility is raised that abnormally high concentrations of malonyl-coa in liver and skeletal muscle suppress the activity of mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase i and thus fatty acid oxidation in both it is suggested that the buildup of fat within the muscle cell (caused in part by excessive delivery of vldls from the liver) interferes with glucose transport or metabolism or producing insulin elevated circulating concentrations of fatty acids are also implicated in the etiology of type 2 diabetes by virtue of 1) their powerful acute insulinotropic 2) their ability to exacerbate insulin resistance in and 3) their long-term detrimental action on pancreatic beta-cell
fuel partitioning and food fuel metabolism generates signals that the brain uses to control food because the influence of metabolism on eating behavior depends on where and in what way metabolic fuels are the partitioning of fuels among different tissues and between metabolic pathways has significant effects on food there is substantial evidence that shifts in fat fuel partitioning between oxidation and storage influence food and data indicate that this may also be the case for carbohydrate and fat fuel interactions appear to affect eating and may play a role in the overconsumption of high-fat a mechanism for the control of eating behavior that is sensitive to a stimulus generated at the level of oxidative phosphorylation and atp production may underlie changes in food intake associated with shifts in fuel a model based on such a mechanism provides a framework for understanding changes in food intake under a variety of conditions associated with alterations in energy storage and including obesity and
