attentional biases for negative information in induced and naturally occurring two studies investigated the relationship between attentional biases for negative information and dysphoria--both induced (study 1) and naturally occurring (study in a modified dot probe task a series of word pairs was and ss responded to probes that replaced one of the words in each the stimuli included anxiety-related and neutral to examine the time course of the attentional there were three exposure durations of the word 14 ms (+ 186 ms 500 ms and 1000 in study the depressed mood induction procedure was associated with greater vigilance for depression-related words at 500 with a similar trend at 1000 in study measures of depressed mood and vulnerability correlated positively with vigilance for negative words in the 1000 ms there was no evidence from either study that depressed mood was associated with a pre-conscious bias for negative words in the 14 ms masked exposure this pre-conscious bias was associated with high trait anxiety in study consistent with previous the results are discussed in relation to theoretical and empirical work on cognitive biases in clinical and non-clinical anxiety and
depression in multiple an association between multiple sclerosis (ms) and depression has been recognized for several decades and has attracted considerable attention in there are considerable gaps in the current state of in this the literature concerned (1) the burden of depression in (2) the etiology of depression in and (3) the treatment of depression in ms are critically the literature review utilized medline and was supplemented by citations extracted from the papers originally numerous studies have identified elevated depressive symptom scores in ms patients relative to nonclinical and (some) clinical control studies of depressive disorders have clearly documented elevated prevalence rates in ms the literature does not identify any specific pattern of neurological involvement as being consistently associated with depressive symptoms or psychosocial risk factors contribute to the etiology of depression in but the relative importance of various risk factors is yet to be a single randomized controlled clinical and additional anecdotal suggests that antidepressant pharmacotherapy is effective for depressive disorders in future epidemiological studies should not restrict their evaluation of risk factors to those specific factors that are closely related to the disease in future researchers should resist the temptation to focus too exclusively on psychological and social risk factors are all potentially additional empirical efforts to refine the various treatment approaches would be a welcome addition to this

weight gain in depression remitted with pharmacological or recovery depression remission is often associated with weight it is not clear if weight gain is caused by a pharmacological effect of or if instead it is an effect of recovery from the aim of this study was to try to clarify this one hundred consecutive unipolar/bipolar remitted depressed private practice outpatients (dsm-iv diagnoses with structured interview) were interviewed with structured questions about weight changes occurring during depression and comparisons were made between remitted weight gainers and remitted nonweight seventy-two percent of patients showed weight gain when they remitted from in comparison with their weight when they were no significant differences were found in duration of use of tricyclic-ssri and mood stabilizers in remitted weight gainers versus nonweight ssris were significantly more used in remitted nonweight significantly more weight loss and less weight gain when depressed were found in remitted weight gainers versus nonweight these findings suggest that weight gain in remitted depressed patients may not necessarily be a pharmacological effect of but may rather be an at least in of recovery from
