pathways of lead exposure in urban a linear structural equation modeling procedure was used to explore the mechanisms and pathways for lead intake among urban children and the relative contribution of various lead sources to lead-contaminated house dust lead levels were significantly associated with blood lead both indirectly and directly via hand both soil and paint lead contributed to dust lead but paint contributed significantly more lead to house dust than soil (p < black race and income level both directly affected blood lead time spent outdoors was associated with children putting soil or dirt in their mouths which in associated with blood lead these data indicate that mouthing behaviors are an important mechanism of exposure among urban children with low-level elevations in blood lead and that lead-based paint is a more important contributor of lead to house dust than is lead-contaminated
solubilization of lead from crystal dust in protein solution (pseudointerstitial fluid) and gastric since several workers engaged in polishing and engraving crystal articles were found to have higher than average blood levels of lead (560 range 80-560 we investigated the hypothesis that crystal dust releases lead in the human to test the two types of crystal polishing having different lead were mixed with human serum diluted (pseudointerstitial gastric and phosphate buffer at ph after 14 days of the diluted serum had extracted of the lead in the crystal dust (particle size < 20 microns) containing lead and of that containing after 48 hr in gastric and of the lead was extracted from crystal dusts (unsieved crystal dusts) containing and after 28 days in alkaline and of the lead was extracted respectively from the same two crystal dusts (unsieved crystal
lead exchange in teeth and bone--a pilot study using stable lead stable lead isotopes and lead concentrations were measured in the enamel and dentine of permanent (n = 37) and deciduous teeth (n = 14) from 47 european immigrants to australia to determine whether lead exchange occurs in teeth and how it relates to lead exchange in enamel exhibits no exchange of its european-origin lead with lead from the australian in dentine lead exchanges with australian lead to the extent of approximately 1% per in one trabecular bone from the tooth socket exchanged almost all its european lead with australian lead over a a 15-year period (turnover of approximately 6% per similar to the approximately 8% per year proposed for lead turnover in trabecular the repository characteristics of intact circumpulpal dentine were investigated by analyses of four sets of contiguous slices from six 1) a set consisting of slices with intact circumpulpal dentine and 2) a set in which these areas were 3) another set consisting of slices with intact circumpulpal dentine and and 4) a set without these analyses show relatively small differences in isotopic composition between contiguous slices except that circumpulpal dentine appears to be the dominant control on lead there is a significant correlation (r2 = p = n = 34) of dentine lead concentration and rate of exchange with residence time from the country of origin and australian but there is no such correlation with enamel lead analyses of permanent and deciduous teeth of subjects from other countries who have resided in australia for varying lengths of time should resolve some of the questions arising from this pilot

lead concentrations in human urine and whole blood-lead levels and to some extent urinary lead are the most employed measures of lead exposure and the small fraction of lead present in plasma (usually below 1% of that in blood) is probably more relevant to lead exposure and the lead content of plasma lead (p-pb) has only seldom been mainly due to analytical which have now been we examined p-pb in occupationally exposed as well as its relationship with b-pb and blood samples were obtained from 145 male 110 of whom were employed in lead after a simple dilution of p-pb was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass the detection limit was and the imprecision was the lead concentration ranges were microg/l for microg/l (density adjusted) for and 9-930 microg/l for a close exponential relation was obtained between b-pb and when b-pb was plotted versus log a straight line (log p-pb = x b-pb - r = was both the relation between u-pb and p-pb and that between u-pb and b-pb showed a large scattering (r = in both the relation to b-pb appeared to be while that to p-pb appeared to be the low detection limit and good precision of p-pb determinations make it possible to use p-pb in assessments of lead exposure and in relative p-pb is a more sensitive measure than especially at high lead this development is of importance for studies of possibly also for studies of
dietary lead intakes for mother/child pairs and relevance to pharmacokinetic blood and environmental including a quarterly 6-day duplicate for nine mother/child pairs from eastern europe have been monitored for 12 to >24 months with high precision stable lead isotope analysis to evaluate the changes that occur when the subjects moved from one environment (eastern europe) to another with different stable lead isotopes the children were between 6 and 11 years of age and the mothers were between 29 and 37 years of these data were compared with an australian control mother/child aged 31 and 6 a rationale for undertaking this study of mother/child pairs was to evaluate if there were differences in the patterns and clearance rates of lead from blood in children compared with their blood lead concentrations ranged from to microg/dl in the children and between and microg/dl in the but the mean of differences between each mother and her child did not differ significantly from duplicate diets contained from to microg pb/kg the mean+/- standard deviation was +/- microg pb/kg and total daily dietary intakes ranged from to mean daily dietary intakes relative to body weight showed that the intake for children was approximately double that for the mothers 113 microg pb/kg body the correlations between blood lead concentration and mean daily dietary intake either relative to body weight or total dietary intake did not reach statistical significance estimation of the lead coming from skeletal (endogenous) sources relative to the contribution from environmental (exogenous) sources ranges from 8 to 70% for the mothers and 12 to 66% for the the difference between mothers and children is not statistically significant (p = the children do not appear to achieve the australian lead isotopic profile at a faster rate than their these data provide evidence that the absorption or uptake of lead from dietary sources is similar in adult females and children of the age in this in spite of lower bone lead and faster bone remodeling and recycling in children compared with adult we see no differences between the mothers and their children in overall contribution of tissue lead to blood results from this study suggest that fractional absorption of ingested lead by children 6-11 years of age is comparable with absorption patterns observed among adult females in the 29-37-year-old age because pharmacokinetic models apply a 40-50% absorption even for 7-year-old further investigations on fractional absorption of ingested lead by young children are investigations are especially needed in younger children than those who were subjects in the current particularly children in the 1-3-year-old age in the effect of nutritional status and patterns of food intake on lead absorption require particularly given the increased prevalence of marginal nutritional status among low-income populations that are at increased risk of elevated blood lead
comparison of methods for personal sampling of inhalable and total lead and cadmium-containing aerosols in a primary lead it has been proposed that future occupational aerosol exposure standards be based on particle size-selective sampling criteria that more accurately reflect worker in relation to methods currently used for determining individual lead the widely used plastic sampling cassette is known from laboratory wind tunnel studies to undersample significantly compared with estimations of aerosol actually especially for large the present study investigated the degree to which this is borne out in field sampling by using side-by-side sampling in selected work sites in a primary lead exposures to airborne lead and cadmium as measured using the 37-mm sampler (e37) were compared with exposure measurements using the institute of occupational medicine (iom) personal inhalable aerosol sampler there were 166 good sample pairs for lead and 55 for the ratio (reflecting the fractional undersampling of the 37-mm as represented by the ratio eiom/e37) was consistently greater than by factors obtained by regression analysis ranging (for different parts of the plant) from to for lead and to for the factor tended to be greater for parts of the plant characterized by coarser consistent with the physical sampling characteristics of the two this research is important (1) in assessing the impact of implementation of new standards for lead- and cadmium-containing aerosols in the primary lead production and (2) in the development of new occupational exposure limits based on the inhalable aerosol
