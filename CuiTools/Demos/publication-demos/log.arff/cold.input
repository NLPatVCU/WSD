risk factors for sudden a case-control in order to investigate risk factors for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (sudden a case-control study was done in 109 patients with sudden deafness who visited our hospital between 1992 and with 109 controls matched to each patient by gender and odds ratio (or) and 95% confidence interval (ci) for smoking drinking dietary environmental past history of sleeping incidence of common cold were fatigue 95% and loss of appetite 95% elevated the risk for sudden those who ate many fresh vegetables were at a decreased risk 95% for light-colored 95% for green-yellow personal histories of hypertension and thyroid and susceptibility to colds appeared to be positively associated with the risk < p < smoking drinking habits and environmental noise had no significant association with sudden these results suggested that environmental including may be importantly involved in the genesis of sudden
cellular uptake properties of a chimeric hammerhead ribozyme targeted to the epidermal growth factor receptor catalytic rna or ribozymes have important potential applications as molecular biological tools in the study of gene expression and as therapeutic inhibitors of disease-causing very little is about the cellular uptake mechanisms of exogenously delivered synthetic in this we have characterized the uptake properties of a ribozyme containing u4/u7 amino groups within the catalytic core of the hammerhead the cellular uptake of the internally [32p]-radiolabeled hammerhead ribozyme in u87-mg glioma cells was and ph dependent and involved an active process that could be competed with cold ribozyme of the same chemistry and an all ribozyme of the same antisense and a variety of other polyanions (salmon sperm dextran and subcellular distribution studies of fluorescently labeled ribozymes confirmed an punctate localization similar to that observed for an endosomal our study highlights that hammerhead despite exhibiting a defined secondary enter cells by an endocytic mechanism that appears to be similar to that reported for a variety of antisense these observations should facilitate the development of more efficient delivery
cold and post-traumatic modeling of the peripheral nerve hypersensitivity to cold is a relatively frequent sequel of peripheral nerve injuries but its mechanism is not well we suggested that incomplete recovery of diameter of regenerated fibers is one of the factors involved in cold intolerance after nerve conduction velocity is correlated to fiber and is slowed down by in normal cold does not desynchronize the volleys of sensory impulses sufficiently to change the intelligibility of the peripheral sensory perceptions remain accurate although they acquire a characteristic on the other post-traumatic reduction in fiber diameters causes a permanent distortion of the we considered that when the distortion is the resulting messages may be perceived by the centers as containing nociceptive we further hypothesized even in cases of moderate permanent cold acts by increasing the post-traumatic abnormalities of impulse in decompensation is observed when a threshold of desynchronization is we constructed a model of peripheral nerve messages in an attempt to represent and quantitate the desynchronizations produced by cold and crush damage lesions in peripheral nerve a number of parameters concerning fiber exposure to and type of nerve damage were taken into four elementary types of desynchronization could be recognized by considering the times of arrival of pairs of impulses at the nervous the difference between a normal and a distorted message could be expressed by eight although our model was quite a large amount of data was obtained and a preliminary statistical study was necessary in order to orient the final we used factor analysis in an attempt to obtain a satisfactory interpretation of the the results indicated that peripheral desynchronization might at least in the painful sensations experienced in winter by many patients after peripheral nerve
leptin does not reduce body fat content but augments cold defense abilities in thermoneutrally reared rat a previous study showed that recombinant leptin markedly affects the body fat content and thermoregulatory energy expenditure of lean (+/+ and +/fa) suckling-age and we wanted to find out whether leptin in doses that halved body fat of cold-reared lean pups had any effect in thermoneutrally reared lean when +/+ pups were artificially reared from 4 to 16 days of age at thermoneutrality and treated as before with leptin from day their total metabolic rate throughout the treatment period was only 4% higher than that of the control littermates and their final body fat content only 4% lower (both we conclude from comparisons of the results in +/+ pups at cold and thermoneutral conditions that leptin does not but rather sympathetically mediated thermoregulatory
chronic cold stress alters the basal and evoked electrophysiological activity of rat locus coeruleus in vivo extracellular single-unit recording techniques revealed that chronic cold stress significantly alters both the basal and the evoked electrophysiological activity of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus of the anaesthetized following 17-21 days of chronic cold exposure (5 degrees the single-unit activity of histologically-identified locus coeruleus neurons in chloral hydrate-anaesthetized rats was recorded and analysed in terms of their basal firing rate and pattern of spike as well as their response to footshock there was no significant difference in the incidence of spontaneously active cells/electrode track between cold-stressed rats and control the basal spike activity of locus coeruleus cells recorded from cold-stressed rats differed significantly from that of control rats along two i) they displayed significantly higher basal firing rates (mean = hz vs and ii) they frequently exhibited spontaneous burst-firing activity that was not observed in control rats (observed in 15/17 cold-stressed rats vs 1/26 control the evoked spike activity of locus coeruleus cells in cold-stressed rats also differed significantly from that of control rats along two i) they were more likely to respond to footshock stimulation (mean = vs and ii) these responses were more likely to consist of multispike bursts of action potentials (mean = 8 bursts/50 stimulations vs 1 burst/50 these results indicate that alterations in the electrophysiological activity of noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons may contribute to the phenomenon of stress-induced sensitization of norepinephrine release that is thought to underlie some of the neuropathological changes that accompany long-term
relationship between cold tolerance and generation of suppressor macrophages during acute cold acute cold stress induces suppressor macrophages expressing large numbers of receptors to the crystallizable fragment (fc) portion of immunoglobulin g (mac-1+ fcgammarii/iiibright resulting in the immunosuppression of splenocyte the generation of mac-1+ fcgammarii/iiibright cells is mediated by the action of glucocorticoids (gcs) through the in the present the generation of mac-1+ fcgammarii/iiibright cells in peritoneal exudate cells was closely related to the decrease of rectal temperature during 3-day exposure to 5 degrees we next investigated the effects of improved cold tolerance on the generation of mac-1+ fcgammarii/iiibright cells during acute cold mice were adapted to cold by exposure to 5 degrees c for 3 wk (cold-acclimated mice) and then reexposed to 5 degrees c for 3 h (acute cold stress) after living at 25 degrees c for 24 the rectal temperature of cold-acclimated mice was not decreased by the acute cold in the proportion of mac-1+ fcgammarii/iiibright cells in peritoneal exudate cell population from cold-acclimated mice was unaffected by the acute cold the cold acclimation significantly attenuated the increases in serum corticosterone levels and the expression of the gc-receptor mrna on peritoneal exudate cells in response to acute cold these results suggest that the altered gc response to acute cold stress by the improvement of cold tolerance inhibits the generation of suppressor macrophages during acute cold
cold storage induces an endothelium-independent relaxation to hypoxia/reoxygenation in porcine coronary tissues are often cold stored for physiological studies and for clinical we report that cold storage induces a relaxation to reoxygenation after hypoxia (h/r) in de-endothelialized porcine coronary in fresh denuded arteries stimulated with h/r did not elicit after overnight cold storage (4 degrees h/r elicited a transient relaxation with peak relaxation of 56 +/- 8% (n = which was reproducible after 2 days of cold the h/r relaxation was inhibited by methylene blue (10 microm) and ly83583 (10 o2-hemoglobin (1 or n(g)-methyl-l-arginine but neither n(g)-nitro-l-arginine mm) nor cyclo-oxygenase inhibition was the h/r relaxation was attenuated by kcl (40 mm) or tetrabutylammonium chloride (5 a non-selective inhibitor of k+ authentic nitric oxide (no)- or s-nitroso-n-acetylpenicillamine (snap)-induced relaxations were enhanced by cold storage in u46619 microm) when tissues were contracted with kcl (40 the enhancement in no- or snap-induced relaxation by cold storage was markedly smaller than with neither catalase u/ml) nor 3-amino-triazole (50 an inhibitor of affected the h/r the duration of h/r relaxation also increased with the period of incubation at 37 degrees c in the organ this was blocked by inhibition of no synthesis or guanylate inhibition of protein synthesis with actinomycin d microm) and cycloheximide (10 or dexamethasone (1 an inhibitor of no synthase blocked this increase in the duration of the h/r the results suggest that in smooth muscle induction of no pathway which is in part mediated by k+ channels and inducible no may be of importance to the understanding of ischemia/reperfusion responses in cold-stored
pediatric post-operative morbidity comparing microsurgical bipolar dissection versus cold sharp a prospective single-blinded study was conducted to compare pediatric tonsillectomy using the traditional cold sharp dissection with ligation for securing hemostasis (csdl) versus microsurgical bipolar dissection technique sixty children aged between 2 and 14 years were sequentially assigned to each blood loss and postoperative pain in the first hour were markedly decreased in the mbct group (p < and p < average surgical time was slightly decreased in diathermy tonsillectomy compared with the cold technique return to normal diet was significantly earlier in the csdl group (p < late postoperative pain measured on the tenth day showed a moderate increase in children who underwent there was no difference between the two techniques in the incidence of postoperative no major complications we believe mbct is a fast and safe technique which may be useful in children with known bleeding it increases late postoperative pain delay in return to normal it does not represent a significant advantage over the traditional csdl

detection of eubacteria in interstitial cystitis by 16s rdna to determine what role non-culturable microorganisms play in the etiology of interstitial cystitis materials and thirty patients fulfilling nih criteria for the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis and sixteen control patients with culture negative urine gave written informed consent and underwent bladder polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using two sets of universal primers for bacterial 16s rdna was performed on urine from the cystoscope and on a cold cup bladder biopsy of the pcr positive bladder three patients with interstitial cystitis and three controls were randomly selected and ten clones from each were sequenced and putative taxonomic assignments 12/26 (46%) ic and 5/12 (42%) control urine specimens and 16/30 (53%) and 9/15 (60%) bladder biopsies were pcr the bacterial populations in the two patient groups tested appeared to be different based upon analysis of the 16s rrna both ic and control patients had non-culturable bacteria in their a random sampling of the two populations revealed that the bacterial populations are suggesting a possible link between one or more bacterial species and
partitioning of proteins into plasma membrane clustering of mutant influenza virus hemagglutinins into coated pits depends on the strength of the internalization internalization of membrane proteins involves their recruitment into plasma membrane clathrin-coated with which they are thought to interact by binding to ap-2 adaptor protein to investigate the interactions of membrane proteins with coated pits at the cell we applied image correlation spectroscopy to measure directly and quantitatively the clustering of influenza hemagglutinin (ha) protein mutants carrying specific cytoplasmic internalization the ha system enables direct comparison between isolated internalization because ha itself is excluded from coated the studies presented here for the first a direct quantitative measure for the degree of clustering of membrane proteins in coated pits at the cell the degree of clustering depended on the strength of the internalization signal and on the integrity of the clathrin lattices and correlated with the internalization rates of the the clustering of the ha mutants fully correlated with their ability to co-precipitate alpha-adaptin from whole the first such demonstration for a membrane protein that is not a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor both the clustering in coated pits and the co-precipitation with alpha-adaptin were dramatically reduced in the suggesting that low temperature can interfere with the sorting of proteins into coated in addition to the specific results reported the general applicability of the image correlation spectroscopy approach to study any process involving the clustering or oligomerization of membrane receptors at the cell surface is
a reassessment of the molecular origin of cold the existence of cold denaturation is now firmly demonstrated by its direct observation for several globular proteins in aqueous but the physico-chemical explanation of this intriguing phenomenon is still in this paper we deepen our understanding of cold denaturation by taking advantage of the theoretical model developed by ikegami and using thermodynamic data on the transfer to water of liquid n-alkyl the analysis leads to the conclusion that the presence of water is fundamental to determine the existence of cold denaturation due to its strong energetic interaction with the amino acid residues previously buried in the
a family of cold shock proteins in bacillus subtilis is essential for cellular growth and for efficient protein synthesis at optimal and low like other bacillus subtilis possesses a family of homologous small acidic proteins cspc and identity >70%) that are strongly induced in response to cold we show that deletion of cspc or cspd genes did not result in a detectable in csp double mutants exhibited severe reduction in cellular growth at 15 degrees c as well as at 37 degrees including impairment of survival during the stationary two-dimensional gel analysis showed that protein synthesis was deregulated in csp double mutants and that the loss of one or two csps led to an increase in the synthesis of the remaining csp(s) at 37 degrees c and after cold suggesting that csps down-regulate production of members from this protein a cspb/c/d triple mutant (64bcdbt) could only be generated in the presence of cspb in trans on a plasmid that was not in spite of lack of antibiotic indicating that a minimum of one csp gene is essential for viability of after cold synthesis of cspb in 64bcdbt was drastically lower than in wild-type cells accompanied by cessation in growth and strong reduction in general protein as cspc and cspd are shown to bind to rna in a co-operative and interactive csps are suggested to function as rna chaperones facilitating the initiation of translation under optimal and low
trimetazidine prevents renal injury in the isolated perfused pig kidney exposed to prolonged cold ischemia caused by cold storage (cs) and reperfusion of the kidney is often responsible for delayed graft function after significant attention has been focused on the cascade of events involved in ischemia-reperfusion with the objective of identifying drugs to ameliorate the functional damage that the purpose of this study was to evaluate the renal function of isolated perfused pig kidneys after 48 hr of cs with euro-collins (ec) solution plus trimetazidine standard ec or university of wisconsin (uw) normothermic isolated perfused pig kidneys were randomized into five experimental (a) control group (cold flush with cold heparinized saline and immediately (b) cold flush with cold heparinized saline with tmz (10(-6) (c) 48 hr of cs with ec and reperfusion (d) 48 hr of cs with ec+tmz alone and reperfusion (e) 48 hr of cs with uw and reperfusion proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and biochemical studies were performed for the functional evaluation during lipid peroxidation was also histological examination (optical and electron microscopy) was performed after cs and using the renal perfusate flow rate as well as the glomerular filtration rate and proximal tubular function were significantly this improvement of renal function during reperfusion was correlated with a less significant cellular and interstitial in tubular injury markers were significantly lower in the group preserved with and tmz reduced lipid peroxidation dramatically during the addition of tmz to the ec solution increased the preservation quality and renal tubular and gave protection from reperfusion injury better than ec alone or these results strongly suggest that tmz has a cytoprotective effect and may therefore be useful for kidney

deletion analysis of cspa of escherichia requirement of the at-rich up element for cspa transcription and the downstream box in the coding region for its cold shock in order to analyse the mechanism of cold shock induction of a major cold shock protein of escherichia deletion analysis of the cspa gene was carried it was found that (i) the at-rich sequence (-47 to -38) upstream of the cspa -35 region may act as the up element playing a crucial role in cspa transcription at both 37 degrees c and 15 degrees (ii) the unusually long of the cspa mrna has negative effects on cspa expression at 37 degrees and (iii) in the exerts a positive effect on mrna stabilization at low it was demonstrated that the 14 base downstream box (db) locating 12 bases downstream of the initiation codon of the cspa mrna and complementary to a region near the decoding region of 16s rrna was essential for the mrna translation during the growth lag acclimation phase immediately after cold during this translation of non-cold shock gene mrnas is since they require cold shock-specific ribosomal factors for the formation of the translation initiation it is proposed that db in cold shock mrnas allows the formation of a stable initiation complex at low temperature in the absence of the cold shock ribosomal
relationship of breastfeeding and formula-feeding practices with infant health outcomes in an urban poor the article reports a study examining symptoms of infection and use of medications and the health care system by breastfeeding or formula-feeding urban poor a self-report design was mothers completed a demographic and anthropometric an infection and a medication and health care system results showed that more of the breastfeeders were and economically better off than formula scores on the infection checklist were higher for those feeding their infants by episodes of ear and health care utilization were less frequent for breastfed this small study suggests that there is a protective effect of breastfeeding in this population and provides a basis for larger epidemiologic and cross-sectional
role of escherichia coli cspa promoter sequences and adaptation of translational apparatus in the cold shock a shift in growth temperature from 37 degrees c to 15 degrees c leads to a dramatic increase in the level of the major cold shock protein of escherichia to investigate the molecular basis of this we considered the relevance of transcriptional and posttranscriptional controls by analyzing the steady-state levels of transcripts and the expression of reporter genes in cells carrying a set of cspa promoter fragments of variable length fused to lacz or cat we demonstrate (i) the core cspa promoter (from -40 to +16) responds to cold shock and a mutation at -36 increases the relative activity of the promoter at low temperature by (ii) the sequences upstream of -40 have a positive effect on expression at 37 degrees but no effect on the cold shock (iii) by virtue of their influence on mrna the downstream sequences (from +81 to +165) reduce expression at 37 degrees c and increase the intensity of the cold shock (iv) mutations in the gcacatca and ccaat present at +1/-4 and between the -10 and -35 do not affect the cold shock response of the cspa (v) following cold a modification of the protein synthetic machinery takes place that allows preferential translation of cspa mrna relative to the non-cold shock cat and lacz the quantitatively modest transcriptional activation shown by the core promoter of cspa following cold shock suggests that transcriptional activation can significantly contribute to cold shock induction only when coupled to posttranscriptional such as alterations in mrna stability and the translational role of escherichia coli cspa promoter sequences and adaptation of translational apparatus in the cold shock a shift in growth temperature from 37 degrees c to 15 degrees c leads to a dramatic increase in the level of the major cold shock protein of escherichia to investigate the molecular basis of this we considered the relevance of transcriptional and posttranscriptional controls by analyzing the steady-state levels of transcripts and the expression of reporter genes in cells carrying a set of cspa promoter fragments of variable length fused to lacz or cat we demonstrate (i) the core cspa promoter (from -40 to +16) responds to cold shock and a mutation at -36 increases the relative activity of the promoter at low temperature by (ii) the sequences upstream of -40 have a positive effect on expression at 37 degrees but no effect on the cold shock (iii) by virtue of their influence on mrna the downstream sequences (from +81 to +165) reduce expression at 37 degrees c and increase the intensity of the cold shock (iv) mutations in the gcacatca and ccaat present at +1/-4 and between the -10 and -35 do not affect the cold shock response of the cspa (v) following cold a modification of the protein synthetic machinery takes place that allows preferential translation of cspa mrna relative to the non-cold shock cat and lacz the quantitatively modest transcriptional activation shown by the core promoter of cspa following cold shock suggests that transcriptional activation can significantly contribute to cold shock induction only when coupled to posttranscriptional such as alterations in mrna stability and the translational

cloning of a novel y-box homology protein (chkyb-1hp) cdna lacking the cold-shock we have isolated the complete cdna clone of a novel 262 amino acid chicken yb-1 homology protein (chkyb-1hp) by screening a chicken embryo cdna expression while the chkyb-1hp is identical over its carboxyl-terminal 78 amino acids with the y-box protein it differs strikingly from all other y-box transcription factors by lacking the cold-shock domain we propose that proteins like chkyb-1hp that lack the but retain the hydrophilic carboxyl domain could regulate y-box proteins through the formation of heterodimeric
analysis of the reconstructibility and noise properties of scattered photons in 99mtc since scattered photons carry degraded spatial scatter is typically considered a source of contamination in with the advent of scatter modelling methods and reconstruction-based scatter compensation it may be possible to utilize scattered data in a productive in this work we analyse the reconstructibility of scattered photon projection data and investigate the potential for using scattered photons to reduce the noise levels of spect we have simulated projection data for an elliptical phantom containing three cold rods in a uniform background of 99mtc a variety of photopeak and scatter energy windows were as well as corresponding rbsc transfer each statistically weighted matrix was decomposed using svd and analysed in terms of reconstructibility and noise results indicate that scattered photons contain sufficient information to reconstruct the source but the scatter-only matrices are very poorly we have also evaluated several methods of utilizing scattered events via and compared them with idealized methods of handling it was found that scattered photons can be used productively when photopeak and non-photopeak data are separated through the use of multiple energy the rbsc methods outperformed ideal scatter but fell short of methods which assume perfect discrimination between scattered and primary the knowledge gained by this study may help guide future research and lead to better approaches to handling scatter in
oxidative inactivation of gastric peroxidase by site-specific generation of hydroxyl radical and its role in stress-induced gastric we have shown earlier that restraint-cold stress-induced gastric ulceration in rats is caused by metal ion-dependent generation of hydroxyl radical and oxidative inactivation of the gastric peroxidase an important h2o2 scavenging to study the mechanism of the oxidative damage of the purified enzyme was exposed to an generating system containing and kinetic studies indicate that the enzyme is inactivated in a time-dependent process showing saturation with respect to cu2+ the enzyme specifically requires cu2+ and is not inactivated by the same concentration of or sensitivity to catalase indicates the critical role of h2o2 in the inactivation is insensitive to superoxide suggesting no role of the rate of inactivation is not increased in d2o excluding the involvement of singlet oxygen in the scavengers such as benzoate or mannitol cannot prevent the results indicate a plausible generation of within the enzyme molecule as the cause of fragmentation of peptide linkage or intramolecular gross change of tertiary or change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence which occurs in oxidation are not inactivation is dependent on ph and from a plot of k(obs) of inactivation against the controlling role of an ionizable group of the enzyme having a pka of could be deprotonation of which favors amino acid analysis shows a specific loss of two lysine residues in the inactivated competitive kinetic studies indicate that pyridoxal a specific modifier of the lysine prevents inactivation by competing with cu2+ for binding at the a cu2+ binding motif consisting at least of two lysine residues exists in which specifically binds cu2+ and generates the radical oxidizes the lysine residues and perturbs the heme environment to cause we suggest that oxidative damage of gpo is mediated by site-specific generation of and not by the generated in the bulk

on the cutaneous receptors contributing to withdrawal reflex pathways in the decerebrate spinal previous studies indicate that the withdrawal reflex system in the rat has a each reflex pathway performing a specific sensorimotor we wished to clarify which cutaneous receptors contribute to this system and to determine whether there are differences in this respect between reflex pathways of different withdrawal reflexes of the peroneus extensor digitorum and semitendinosus muscles were recorded with emg techniques during high reflex excitability in decerebrate spinal rats while maintained innocuous pressure on glabrous skin could elicit a sustained reflex activity in all muscles vibration of glabrous skin (10-300 hz) always failed to evoke a reflex suggesting that slowly but not rapidly low-threshold mechanoreceptive fibers from this type of skin contribute to withdrawal reflex thermal stimulation in the innocuous cooling from 32 to 17 degrees or warming the skin from 32 to 41 degrees always failed to produce reflex indicating that neither cold nor warm receptors contribute to withdrawal reflex when either cooling or warming the skin to the noxious temperatures of 1 degrees c or above 45 degrees a reflex discharge was often evoked in the muscles intradermal administration of a potent pruritogenic produced very or reflex in mustard oil produced vigorous reflex responses in all muscles these findings suggest that some chemonociceptors contribute only or not at to withdrawal reflex the present data suggest that a selective set of cutaneous receptors contribute to withdrawal reflex pathways and that different withdrawal reflex pathways receive input from essentially the same cutaneous receptor
identification of pseudomonads from fresh and chill-stored chicken results of carbon source assimilation tests (17 carbon compounds) led to 88% of pseudomonads from cold-stored chicken carcasses being assigned to one of 17 of these 13 had combinations of properties identical or with readily recognizable degrees of similarity to those of published two of the four groups having carbon assimilation patterns dissimilar to any known species had cellular fatty acid composition corresponding to pseudomonas and two to pseudomonas lundensis or pseudomonas the fluorescens biovars all had higher amounts of cis 9 (21-37%) and cis 11 than of cyclo (1-17%) and cyclo in for lundensis and the relative amounts of these unsaturated acids and cyclopropane acids were both the carbon source assimilation tests and the cellular fatty acid composition led to the conclusion that none of the species were although the fluorescens biovars constituted about 50% of the isolated
abeta-fiber mediated activation of cingulate cortex as correlate of central post-stroke a patient is presented who suffered a lateral brainstem infarction which selectively abolished pain and temperature sensitivity in the lower right one year later central post-stroke pain had developed in the affected limb with touch and cold p40m dipoles calculated from magnetoencephalographic fields after electrical stimulation of both tibial nerves were localized in si as is seen in normal stimulation of the affected side caused deep pain sensations and elicited a large n80m best explained by an additionally active dipole in cingulate this early co-activation in a limbic structure suggests peripheral abeta-fiber mediation and lemniscal abnormal link to the pain system may be due to sensitization and reorganization above the level of nociceptive
cold-induced thermoregulation and biological aging is associated with diminished cold-induced thermoregulation the mechanisms accounting for this phenomenon have yet to be clearly elucidated but most likely reflect a combination of increased heat loss and decreased metabolic heat the inability of the aged subject to reduce heat loss during cold exposure is associated with diminished reactive tone of the cutaneous vasculature to a lesser alterations in the insulative properties of body cold-induced metabolic heat production via skeletal muscle shivering thermogenesis and brown adipose tissue nonshivering thermogenesis appears to decline with few investigations have directly linked diminished skeletal muscle shivering thermogenesis with the age-related reduction in cold-induced thermoregulatory age-related declines in skeletal muscle mass and metabolic activity are cited as evidence for decreased heat production via reduced gdp binding to brown fat and uncoupling protein (ucp) levels are cited as evidence for attenuated brown adipose tissue cold-induced nonshivering thermogenic capacity during the age-related reduction in brown fat nonshivering thermogenic capacity most likely reflects altered cellular signal transduction rather than changes in neural and hormonal the discussion in this review focuses on how alterations in cit during the life span may offer insight into possible mechanisms of biological although the preponderance of evidence presented here demonstrates that cit declines with chronological the mechanism reflecting this attenuated function remains to be the inability to draw definitive conclusions regarding biological aging and cit reflects the lack of a clear definition of it is unlikely that the mechanisms accounting for the decline in cold-induced thermoregulation during aging will be determined until biological aging is more precisely
a yeast inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase required for phosphatidylinositol homeostasis and whose absence confers a cold-resistant sequence analysis of saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome ix identified a 946 amino acid open reading frame designated here as that has carboxyl- and amino-terminal regions similar to mammalian inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases and to yeast this two-domain primary structure resembles the mammalian we report that inp51p is associated with a particulate fraction and that recombinant inp51p exhibits intrinsic phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphatase deletion of inp51 (inp51) results in a enabling significantly faster growth at temperatures below 15 degreesc as compared with a parental complementation analysis of an inp51 mutant strain demonstrates that the cold tolerance is strictly due to loss of 5-phosphatase catalytic deletion of plc1 in an inp51 mutant does not abrogate cold indicating that plc1p-mediated production of soluble inositol phosphates is not cells lacking inp51 have a 2-4-fold increase in levels of phosphatidylinositol and inositol whereas cells overexpressing inp51p exhibit a 35% decrease in levels of phosphatidylinositol we conclude that inp51 function is critical for proper phosphatidylinositol in we define a novel role for a 5-phosphatase loss of function mutant that improves the growth of cells at colder temperatures without alteration of growth at normal which may have useful commercial
temperature but not season affects the transplantation immunity of anuran the effects of ambient temperature (22 degrees c/10 degrees c) and season (summer/winter) on anuran skin allograft and xenograft rejection was tested in frogs (rana temporaria and esculenta) and toads (bufo bombina and bombina mean graft survival times were significantly prolonged at the low temperature in a species-specific the edible frog esculenta) being the most sensitive and the common toad (bufo bufo) relatively allografts were more temperature-dependent than in the latter temperature sensitivity was specific to each donor-host rejection of second-set grafts in esculenta was accelerated both in warmth and in but second-set grafts were less temperature-sensitive than sensitizing both in summer and in esculenta rejected allografts promptly at 22 degrees c but slowly at 10 degrees in both bombina variegata kept at 22 degrees c rejected allografts in a chronic this indicates that amphibian transplantation immunity depends on the donor-host genetic disparity and ambient temperature but is independent of

dna methylation and the promotion of flowering by we have tested the hypothesis that the promotion of flowering by prolonged exposure to low temperatures (vernalization) is mediated by dna demethylation & (1993) usa arabidopsis plants that have reduced levels of dna methylation because of the presence of a methyltransferase (meti) antisense gene flowered earlier than untransformed control without the need for a cold decreased dna methylation mutants (ddm1) also flowered earlier than the wild-type progenitor under conditions where they respond to we conclude that demethylation of dna is sufficient to cause early and we have found that the promotion of flowering is directly proportional to the decrease in methylation in meti antisense the early-flowering phenotype was inherited in sexual even when the antisense transgene had been lost by methyltransferase antisense plants with low dna methylation levels responded to a low-temperature treatment by flowering even earlier than their untreated siblings indicating that the promotion of flowering by cold and by demethylation was additive when neither treatment saturated the early-flowering as in untransformed control the cold-induced early-flowering signal was reset in progeny of meti antisense these observations suggest that the demethylation brought about by a meti antisense can account for some properties of but not for the need for revernalization in each
combined intranasal ipratropium bromide and oxymetazoline in experimental rhinovirus the topical anticholinergic ipratropium bromide and topical decongestant oxymetazoline were tested to determine whether oxymetazoline alone and the combination were well tolerated and reduced rhinorrhea and middle ear pressure abnormalities during experimental rhinovirus the study was and double dummy in healthy volunteers (n = 109) with low serum neutralizing antibody titer (< or = treatments inoculated with rhinovirus (type 39 or strain) and randomized to treatment with ipra-tropium bromide two sprays per nostril (84 micrograms per treatment) and oxymetazoline two sprays per oxymetazoline or treatments were self administered twice daily for 5 days beginning 1 day after rhinovirus the overall infection rate was 83% and of those 88% felt that they had a during the 3-hour period after the increase in nasal discharge was significantly lower in the combined ipratropium and oxymetazoline +/- gm/3 mean +/- se) than after oxymetazoline alone +/- gm/3 hr) or vehicle +/- gm/3 over the 5-day observation total daily nasal discharge also tended to be lower in the ipratropium plus oxymetazoline group +/- gm/24 mean +/- se) compared to oxymetazoline +/- 35% reduction) or the vehicle +/- 27% reduction) but the differences were not statistically subjective assessments of rhinorrhea indicated that the severity of rhinorrhea was significantly better among patients receiving oxymetazoline alone or with ipratropium compared to the no significant difference in the cumulative frequencies of middle ear pressure abnormalities (27-31%) were found among the treatment oxymetazoline does not consistently stimulate or decrease nasal mucus and ipratropium added to oxymetazoline is well tolerated and reduces rhinorrhea during experimental rhinovirus
the cold plate as a test of nociceptive description and application to the study of chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain a cold plate apparatus was designed to test the responses of unrestrained rats to low temperature stimulation of the plantar aspect of the at plate temperatures of 10 degrees c and 5 degrees rats with either chronic constriction injury (cci) of the sciatic nerve or complete adjuvant (cfa) induced inflammation of the hindpaw displayed a stereotyped brisk lifts of the treated hindpaw were while no evidence of other nociceptive behaviors could be the most consistent responses were obtained with a plate temperature of 5 degrees c in three 5-min testing separated by 10-min intervals during which the animals were returned to a normal concomitantly to cold the rats were evaluated for their response to heat (plantar test) and mechanical (von frey hairs) in both injury while responses to heat stimuli had normalized at 60 days a clear lateralization of responses to cold was observed throughout the entire study systemic and morphine suppressed responses to cold in a dose-related at doses that did not affect motor or sensory both lidocaine and its quaternary derivative qx-314 similarly reduced paw suggesting that cold hyperalgesia is in part due to peripheral altered nociceptive clonidine was more potent in cci then in cfa rats in reducing the response to clonidine increased the withdrawal latencies to heat in the cci hindpaw at 40 days and at a time when both hindpaws had the same withdrawal latencies in control morphine was also more potent on cci than cfa cold indicating cfa-induced hyperalgesia might be opiate evidence for tonic endogenous inhibition of cold hyperalgesia was obtained for cfa when systemic naltrexone significantly increased the number of paw this was not found in rats with at 60 neither morphine nor naltrexone affected cold-induced paw lifting in cfa suggesting that the neuronal circuit mediating cold hyperalgesia in these animals had become opiate in the cold plate was found to be a reliable method for detecting abnormal nociceptive behavior even at long intervals after nerve or inflammatory when responses to other nociceptive stimuli have returned to near the results of pharmacological studies suggest that cold hyperalgesia is in part a consequence of altered sensory processing in the and that it can be independently modulated by opiate and adrenergic
gentle in situ liver manipulation during organ harvest decreases survival after rat liver role of kupffer the etiology of primary graft nonfunction and dysfunction is unknown but most likely involves kupffer cell-dependent reperfusion the donor operation and surgical technique may also have an effect on the outcome after because liver manipulation during harvest cannot be prevented completely with standard its effect on survival was assessed donor livers were harvested from female sprague-dawley rats (200-230 after minimal dissection during the first 12 livers were either manipulated gently or left alone for 13 subsequent at 25 all livers were perfused with cold university of wisconsin solution via the portal and transplantation was performed after cold storage (1 in some kupffer cells were destroyed with gadolinium chloride or inactivated with dietary glycine before proteolytic activity in the rinse serum trypan blue distribution to index and histology were in the nonmanipulated survival was 100% after gentle manipulation decreased survival by manipulation elevated transaminases fivefold and caused about 200% at proteolytic activity and the time for trypan blue to distribute homogeneously were elevated three- to eightfold by gadolinium chloride and glycine prevented the effects of manipulation on all parameters these data indicate for the first time that gentle manipulation of the donor liver has a marked detrimental effect on survival by priming or activating kupffer this may represent an important early event in because kupffer cells play an important role in primary graft
post pupariation cold storage of three species of increasing chilling tolerance by acclimation and recurrent recovery three species of flies were examined for chilling tolerance from the end of the pupariation to the onset of adult eclosion for the purpose of determining applicability for cold for the musca domestica survival to eclosion was affected by developmental length of and storage houseflies that were closest to having experienced pupariation or the onset of eclosion were the least cold for flies stored at 7 or 10 degrees age groups placed directly into storage at 36-72 and 36-48 h had significantly higher poststorage eclosion than younger or older age death was observed after only 2 or 3 days with the chilling intolerant groups while mid-aged groups survived 10-12 days under cold storage damage could be reduced by giving the mid-aged groups chilled at 7 or 10 degrees c recurrent 2- or 3-h recovery periods every 4 days at 28 degrees examination of o2 consumption throughout the housefly pupal and pharate adult stages showed that the most chilling tolerant groups also had the lowest metabolic combining a prestorage 17-h slow cooling acclimation interval with the recurrent recovery periods increased eclosion of adults 20% for the 12- to 24-h group after 21 days storage at 7 degrees two blowfly lucilia cuprina and lucilia sericata survived 10 degrees c storage best when given a weekly 4-h recovery survival at 90 days poststorage was nearly 50% for cuprina and 80% for increasing survival under subambient temperatures for all three species appears to relate to whether there is a stage of development which allows cold-induced lowering of metabolism that results in a dormant status best characterized as hibernal this study indicates that periodic warming during cold storage increases survival by allowing a chilling intolerant stage to develop to a more tolerant stage and/or by eliminating accumulated toxic

sympathetic activity in brown adipose tissue from rats adapted to a high carbohydrate-free previous studies have shown that adaptation of rats to a high carbohydrate-free (hp) diet results in a marked reduction in brown adipose tissue (bat) thermogenic the present experiments were carried out to assess bat sympathetic activity in hp diet-adapted it was found that interscapular brown adipose tissue (ibat) norepinephrine (ne) fractional turnover rate and calculated rate of turnover were markedly reduced in hp-fed replacement of the hp diet by a balanced diet for 24 h did not affect bat ne content but restored fractional turnover rate and turnover rate values to those of control exposure to cold (4 degrees) for a short period (8 h) induced a marked increase in ibat ne fractional turnover rate and calculated turnover rate in both hp and control the cold-induced rise of turnover rate over values at ambient temperature (25 degrees c) was higher in hp rats than in rectal temperature after 8 h of cold exposure did not differ in hp and control the data suggest that the decreased thermogenic capacity of rats adapted to a high carbohydrate-free diet is due to a reduced sympathetic outflow to which can be rapidly reactivated by cold
