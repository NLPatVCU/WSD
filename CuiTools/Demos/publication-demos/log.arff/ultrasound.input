influence of ablated tissue on the formation of high-intensity focused ultrasound in order to ablate tumours using high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) it is necessary to irradiate the tumour with a confluent array of single ultrasound we have identified a phenomenon that we term lesion-to-lesion which occurs when the spatial separation of individual exposures is such that an existing lesions appears to affect the formation of a subsequent this article investigates the implications of this phenomenon for strategies to ablate large tissue volumes in the treatment of hepatic experiments on pig and rat livers have been carried out using a focused ultrasound system with a frequency of an in situ spatially averaged focal intensity (isal) of 133-658 w cm-2 (isp of 239-1185 w cm-2) and an exposure duration of 5-15 the results show that there is interaction between lesions that spatial exposure separations that depend on the intensities and exposure durations as a either subsequent lesions form closer to the ultrasound source (if the focal peak of the ultrasound beam is placed deep inside the liver tissue) or their length is reduced (if the focal peak is near the liver an explanation is suggested for this effect and a strategy for its avoidance during in vivo hifu treatment is
