perinatal substance the impact of reporting infants to child protective the purposes of this study were to follow the judicial placement of newborns with positive toxicology screening results and to determine how long such infants remained in foster separated from their mothers or other and the length of court we also determined the compliance with court the availability and use of rehabilitative factors used by the court to determine the final and the eventual placement of the the cohort sample consisted of all infants from san mateo county (ca) born at stanford university hospital during a 2-year period whose urine tests in the well-baby nursery were positive for illicit fifty-three newborns were and their medical records and court documents were matched and reviewed from birth until termination of judicial review (or 5 data were summarized and analyzed by logistic regressions to identify predictors of specific all 53 infants had normal physical examinations and uneventful hospital their ethnic with 68% being african-american and 7% being differed from the rest of the nursery which was predominantly twenty-six (46%) of the 53 infants were returned to their mothers within 1 week of 39 (76%) of the infants were reunited with some relative within the first month of at 12 months of 10 infants (19%) remained in foster none remained in foster care beyond 18 the length of time infants were dependents of the court ranged from 1 month to >5 70% of the cases were between 6 and 30 months of nine (17%) were dependents of the court for >36 final placement of the infants was 35 (66%) reunited with at least one 9 (17%) in long-term guardianship relationships with other and 9 (17%) all of the mothers were ordered to complete a drug rehabilitation 24 mothers (44%) fully complied and had repeatedly drug-free urine 2 others (4%) had drug-free urine tests after incomplete participation in drug twenty-two (42%) of the mothers never complied with drug subsequent drug use was evident in less than half of the mothers during the period of only one mother was reported for child characteristics that most strongly predicted failure in family reunification were a history of failed drug previous involvement of child protective or previous removal of a child because of substance identifying and reporting newborns exposed to maternal substance abuse during pregnancy can be associated with beneficial changes in the environment of the infants and successful rehabilitation of many the use of judicial rehabilitative and supportive and long-term involvement of social services without criminal prosecution are key to successful this study supports the policy and recommendation of the american academy of pediatrics and should lessen health concerns about negative effects of reporting these patients to child protective
mechanisms of growth failure in non-growth-hormone deficient children of short so the clinical evaluation of short children has focused on the measurement of immunoreactive growth hormone (gh) in the blood to determine if the growth retardation is due to gh gh-dependent short stature may be caused by defects in either the secretion of bioactive gh or by the inability to respond to both gh secretion and gh responsiveness be evaluated when investigating the cause of short recent advances in molecular biology have generated new ways of studying different molecules involved in growth and new genetic defects have been identified in short
oxygen and placental villous origins of fetal the increasing practice of preterm delivery in the fetal interest for conditions such as pre-eclampsia or intrauterine growth restriction (iugr) has provided an opportunity to study placental structure in pregnancies with prenatal evidence of fetal these data suggest that the origin of fetal hypoxia in iugr with absent end-diastolic flow in the umbilical arteries is due to a failure of oxygen transport from intervillous space to umbilical failure of the fetoplacental circulation to extract oxygen from the intervillous space under such circumstances means intervillous po2 is closer to maternal arterial values than under physiological correspondingly the placental villi are chronically exposed to a higher oxygen tension than under normal circumstances--the term relative to normal intraplacental is proposed to describe this both the trophoblast and villous core react to increased oxygen despite fetal these results challenge the generally accepted concept of in all circumstances where fetal hypoxia might therefore three categories are proposed for the origins of fetal (1) preplacental (2) uteroplacental and (3) postplacental examples for these three disease states are listed in this review and the structural reaction patterns of placental villi to these differences in oxygenation are
communicating foodborne disease the food like many has a risk communication that problem is manifested in the desire to know the truth about outbreaks of foodborne ongoing concern about the safety of and food-processing and continued apathy regarding aspects of routine food if these concerns are addressed in a coherent and trustworthy the public will have better and cheaper sloppy risk communication can itself cause public health because citizens are ill-equipped to discriminate among information the food industry as a whole bears responsibility for the successes and failures of its individual we review risk communication research and practice for their application to the food

electrophysiological analyses of threshold conditions and rate-dependent failure of excitation in single myocytes from rabbit the changes in transmembrane ionic currents that underlie normal excitability and rate-dependent failure were studied in single cells from rabbit ventricle by using whole cell voltage clamp when trains of brief (1 to 2 ms) stimuli are applied at strengths very close to the threshold for a number of different patterns of action potential entrainment and failure are in an individual a characteristic pattern of entrainment or failure can be maintained for a relatively long allowing both a detailed description and a quantitative investigation of the ionic basis for this three hypotheses for rate-dependent failure of excitation in rabbit ventricle were the first is that following relatively high rates of the intracellular calcium ion concentration increases a background inwardly rectifying potassium ion current (ik1) thereby lowering the excitation the second hypothesis is that residual activation of the delayed rectifier potassium ion current (ik) causes the stimulus to become subthreshold as the rate of stimulation the third hypothesis is that small changes in the time and voltage dependence of the inactivation and reactivation of the sodium ion current (ina) result in less net inward ion current for a given waveform of and the cell therefore becomes inexcitable to every second the calcium ion hypothesis was tested by buffering changes in intracellular calcium ion concentrations with the results strongly suggest that changes in intracellular calcium ion concentrations do not contribute significantly to the observed patterns of failure of the delayed rectifier hypothesis was evaluated using the class iii antiarrhythmic drug which selectively blocks a large fraction of the ik current in rabbit dofetilide slightly decreased the stimulus suggesting that residual activation of the rapidly activated outward conductance of potassium ions is an important variable under some the ina hypothesis was tested by altering the size of ina with tetrodotoxin after ttx the threshold for excitation increased and rate-dependent failure and entrainment were no longer observed until the stimulus strength was these results show that ina is an essential variable underlying normal excitation and entrainment in rabbit this is plausible because ina is 20 to 50 times larger than either the maximum outward current due to ik1 or the fully activated ik in this

lymphocytes in the human gastric mucosa during helicobacter pylori have a t helper cell 1 background & studies have shown that gastric t cells are increased during helicobacter pylori the purpose of this study was to characterize the human gastric t-cell responses in the presence or absence of t-cell surface antigens were examined by immunohistochemistry or after isolation for evaluation of surface antigens and cytoplasmic cytokines using flow cd4+ and cd8+ t cells were increased in situ during infection with freshly isolated gastric t cells expressed cytoplasmic interferon gamma (ifn-gamma) and interleukin (il)-2 after a brief simultaneous four-color flow cytometry demonstrated that both cd8+ and cd4+ t cells expressed because stimulation through cd30 favors the induction of il-5 and th2 gastric and colonic t cells were examined for cd30 consistent with the notion that th2 cells are found in the cd30 was evident throughout the lamina propria of the colon but was virtually absent in the freshly isolated gastric t cells produced little il-4 and virtually no il-5 or tumor necrosis factor these observations show that gastric t cells resemble the th1 which may explain their failure to induce immunity to pylori and their ability to contribute to the pathogenesis of gastric
the herpes simplex virus type 1 cleavage/packaging is involved in efficient localization of capsids to replication six including have been implicated in the cleavage and packaging of herpesvirus dna into preassembled we have isolated a ul32 insertion mutant which is capable of near-wild-type levels of viral dna the mutant virus is unable to cleave and package viral consistent with the phenotype of a previously isolated temperature-sensitive herpes simplex virus type 1 tsn20 and virology a polyclonal antibody which recognizes ul32 was previously used by chang et and 1996) to demonstrate that ul32 accumulates predominantly in the cytoplasm of infected in this a functional epitope-tagged version of ul32 showed that while ul32 is predominantly some nuclear staining which colocalizes with the major dna binding protein ul29) in replication compartments can be we have also used a monoclonal antibody (5c) specific for the hexon form of major capsid protein vp5 to study the distribution of capsids during in cells infected with wild-type kos (6 and 8 h 5c staining patterns indicate that capsids are present in nuclei within replication these results suggest that cleavage and packaging occur in replication compartments at least at 6 and 8 h cells infected with the ul32 mutant exhibit a hexon staining pattern which is more diffusely distributed throughout the nucleus and which is not restricted to replication we propose that ul32 may play a role in preassembled capsids to the sites of dna packaging and that the failure to localize to replication compartments may explain the cleavage/packaging defect exhibited by this these results suggest that the ul32 protein is required at a step distinct from those at which other cleavage and packaging proteins are required and may be involved in the correct localization of capsids within infected
persistent vesicourethral dysfunction following radical surgery for rectal urodynamic features and potential abatement with modified sphincterotomy (radical transurethral resection of the vesicourethral function returns after radical rectal surgery during the first year but rarely progresses after 1 we examined the urodynamics of patients whose voiding dysfunction remained after 1 and treated several with a modified sphincterotomy procedure similar to radical transurethral resection of the we analyzed the urodynamic features of vesicourethral dysfunction in 16 male patients with persistent voiding dysfunction for more than 1 year following radical surgery for rectal seven patients elected to undergo radical transurethral resection of prostate (radical tur-p) for the relief of their persistent voiding the mean bladder volume at the first desire to void was 210 the mean maximal bladder capacity was 343 and the mean vesical compliance (cves) was ml/cm all patients demonstrated either vesical denervation supersensitivity (vds) or uninhibited the mean maximal urethral closure pressure was cm and urethral denervation supersensitivity was found in and sphincter dyssynergia in (6/9) of after radical 5 patients became free from the use of 1 patient had a reduced residual urine and 1 patient was but no patient noted a change in urinary urethral dysfunction after radical rectal surgery was caused by failure of the bladder to empty along with an underactive radical tur-p was effective in restoring voiding function in a selected group of these
induction of melanoma antigen-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes in vitro by stimulation with b7-expressing human melanoma cell crosslinking of cd28 receptors on resting t lymphocytes by b7 costimulatory molecules expressed by antigen-presenting cells (apcs) plays a critical role in t-cell human melanomas express major histocompatibility complex (mhc)-restricted tumor-associated antigens that can be recognized by cytotoxic t lymphocytes yet they remain poorly one mechanism for the failure of t-cell response is the lack of expression of costimulatory molecules by human melanoma we have transfected the b7-1 gene into three hla-a2-expressing human melanoma cell and studied their capacity to stimulate primary human t b7-expressing melanoma cells were excellent inducers of t-cell cytokine and cytolytic activity in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte cultures through a process dependent on the function of the t-cell receptor as well as interactions between and subset analysis demonstrated that cd4+ t cells or addition of exogenous interleukin-2 was required for the induction of cd8+ untransfected parental melanoma cells were inert as apcs in these rotating stimulation of t cells with the three b7-expressing cell lines led to the generation of t-cell lines that were cytolytic for hla-a2+ melanoma cells and other hla-a2+ targets that were pulsed with hla-a2-restricted mart-1 these data demonstrate that expression of b7-1 by human melanoma cells converts them into effective apcs for the in vitro induction of melanoma-specific

mitochondrial permeability transition as induced by cross-linking of the adenine nucleotide mitochondrial permeability transition is caused by the opening of a transmembrane pore whose chemical nature has not been well established the present work was aimed to further contribute to the knowledge of the membrane entity comprised in the formation of the non-specific the increased permeability was established by analyzing the inability of rat kidney mitochondria to take up and accumulate as well as their failure to build up a transmembrane after the cross-linking of membrane proteins by copper plus to identify the cross-linked polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was the results are representative of at least three separate it is indicated that 30 microm cu2+ induced the release of nmol ca2+ per mg in the presence of 100 microm ortho-phenanthroline only 2 microm cu2+ was required to attain the total release of the accumulated it should be noted that such a reaction is not inhibited by the increased permeability corresponds to cross-linking of membrane proteins in which approximately 4 nmol thiol groups per mg protein appear to be such a linking process is inhibited by by using the fluorescent probe eosin-5-maleimide the label was found in a cross-linking 60 kda dimer of two 30 kda from the data presented it is concluded that copper-o-phenanthroline induces the intermolecular cross-linking of the adenine nucleotide translocase which in turn is converted to non-specific
regeneration of dorsal column axons after spinal cord injury in young in contrast to previous reports denying the occurrence of axonal regeneration of the dorsal column (dc) here we demonstrate for the first time that marked regeneration occurs spontaneously after transection in infant transection was made sharply so as to produce edema-free lesions without subsequent formation of either scars or transganglionic labeling of axons revealed that regenerated axons ascended in the normal tract in a manner similar to normal projections as a tightly-packed fasciculus and terminated densely in the nucleus the present study indicates that failure of regeneration of dc axons is due to neither intrinsic deficiency of regrowth potential nor globally-inhospitable axonal environment but rather the local conditions of the lesion
peritoneal lavage cytology in gastric an independent predictor of the prevalence and significance of free cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity of clinically m0 gastric cancer patients is we reviewed our results with peritoneal washings to determine (1) the prevalence of positive cytology in m0 and m1 disease and (2) the influence of positive cytology on the pattern of failure and laparoscopic washings were obtained from 127 patients with gastric cancer at memorial sloan-kettering cancer center from december 1990 to august cytology was performed by the papanicolau the prevalence of positive cytology was as 0% (0/45) in t1/t2 m0 10% (3/31) in t3/t4 m0 and 59% in m1 the three m0 patients with positive cytology recurred intra-abdominally (median follow up of survival was significantly less compared with stage-matched controls with negative cytology resected for cure (p and the same as those patients with stage iv patients with positive lavage cytology are stage even in the absence of macroscopic peritoneal laparoscopic lavage cytology is a rapid technique for identifying the subset of m0 patients who are unlikely to benefit from resection such patients require additional treatment strategies to improve
genetically determined failure of activation-induced apoptosis of autoreactive t cells as a cause of multiple i postulate that multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that involves genetically determined failure of activation-induced apoptosis of autoreactive t cells in the central nervous activation of central-nervous-system-reactive t cells in peripheral lymphoid organs by exposure to crossreacting antigens or superantigens derived from common infectious agents may trigger attacks of multiple in normal individuals these activated t cells are deleted by activation-induced but in individuals predisposed to multiple sclerosis they and damage the central nervous the clinical course of multiple sclerosis may vary according to the antigens in the central nervous system being targeting of myelin antigens leads to a relapsing-remitting course of clinical recovery due to remyelination or other targeting of axonal antigens leads to a progressive course from onset because axonal regeneration is limited in the central nervous this hypothesis can account for many characteristics of multiple sclerosis and has predictions that can be
