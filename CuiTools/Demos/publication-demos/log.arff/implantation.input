a cytoplasmic cell cycle controls the activity of a k+ channel in pre-implantation mouse we previously have reported that the activity of a 240 ps k+ channel varies during the cell cycle in pre-implantation mouse in the present we show (i) the cycling of channel activity is not prevented by inhibiting protein synthesis and hence does not involve cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1)-cyclin and (ii) the cycling of channel activity continues in anucleate zygote fragments with a time course similar to that observed in nucleate we further demonstrate (i) persistent activation of the k+ channel in one-cell embryos arrested in metaphase requires the maintenance of an active cdk1-cyclin b and (ii) both dna synthesis inhibition with aphidicolin and dna damage produced by mitomycin c prevent the down-regulation of the channel at the start of s phase by a mechanism that requires tyrosine kinase the 240 ps k+ channel in these cells is controlled by a previously unsuspected cytoplasmic clock that functions independently of the well-known clock controlling the chromosomal cell but can interact with
