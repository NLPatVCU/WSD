amyloidogenic role of cytokine tgf-beta1 in transgenic mice and in deposition of amyoid-beta peptide in the central nervous system is a hallmark of disease and a possible cause of the factors that initiate or promote deposition of amyloid-beta peptide are not the transforming growth factor tgf-beta1 plays a central role in the response of the brain to and increased tgf-beta1 has been found in the central nervous system of patients with here we report that tgf-beta1 induces amyloid-beta deposition in cerebral blood vessels and meninges of aged transgenic mice overexpressing this cytokine from co-expression of tgf-beta1 in transgenic mice overexpressing amyloid-precursor which develop like accelerated the deposition of amyloid-beta more tgf-beta1 messenger rna was present in post-mortem brain tissue of patients than in the levels correlating strongly with amyloid-beta deposition in the damaged cerebral blood vessels of patients with cerebral amyloid these results indicate that overexpression of tgf-beta1 may initiate or promote amyloidogenesis in disease and in experimental models and so may be a risk factor for developing
in situ hybridization and its diagnostic applications in in situ hybridization (ish) is a technique by which specific nucleotide sequences are identified in cells or tissue these may be bacterial or dna or on the basis of research the technique is now being translated into diagnostic mainly in the areas of gene infection and interphase diagnostic applications are most often based on short nucleotide sequences (oligomers) labelled with non-isotopic reporter and sites of binding may be localized by histochemical or immunohistochemical the technique can be applied to routinely fixed and processed with some it is even possible to obtain hybridization in autopsy ish has been used to detect messenger rna (mrna) as a marker of gene where levels of protein storage are for to confirm an endocrine tumour as the source of excess hormone its application in infectious diseases has to date been mainly in viral such as the typing of human papillomavirus (hpv) or the detection of epstein-barr virus by the presence of small nuclear rnas the expression of mrnas for histone proteins has been used to detect cells in s and related methods may be applied to detect apoptotic using probes to chromosome-specific it is possible to detect and to document changes in specific which may have prognostic significance in some such as b-cell chronic lymphatic using sequence-specific translocations can be such as the of this review presents an outline of the technique of in situ hybridization and discusses areas of current and potential diagnostic

embryonic stem cell lines from mrl mice allow genetic modification in a murine model of autoimmune the mrl/mpj-fas(lpr) (mrl-lpr/lpr) mouse spontaneously develops a generalized autoimmune disease with features similar to those of systemic lupus this mouse strain provides a valuable system for identifying and characterizing the multiple genetic factors that influence the pathogenesis of autoimmune one of the most powerful means of examining the role of a specific gene product in vivo is by inactivating the gene in mouse embryonic stem (es) cells by homologous recombination and using these cells to derive mouse lines carrying the inactivated the successful application of this requires an es cell line that will remain stable in culture during the processes of genetic manipulation and to es cell lines that meet this criterion have been derived from only a few mouse here we describe the production and characterization of stable es cell lines from the mrl mouse approximately 7% of the blastocysts derived from the mrl/mpj+ (mrl-+/+) strain gave rise to es cell and both of the male mrl-+/+ es cell lines tested were shown to be germline we show that the mrl-+/+ es cell lines undergo gene targeting by homologous recombination at high frequency by inactivating the gene encoding the ep2 prostaglandin these ep2-targeted mrl es cell lines were used to generate mrl mouse lines heterozygous for the disrupted ep2 thus demonstrating the feasibility of using a genetic approach to dissect the pathobiology of the autoimmune disease in the mrl

anatomical variations and paranasal sinus anatomy and variations have gained interest with the introduction of functional endoscopic sinus surgery and the concept of the ostiomeatal anatomical variations can be divided in structural (increased) pneumatization and supplementary most anatomical variations are equally found in control and sinusitis the anatomical variations which are most commonly associated with sinus pathology are septal true conchae bullosae and supplementary maxillary ostia but the latter one only when recycling is the knowledge of anatomical variations is most important in the surgical management and specifically in the prevention of
neuropsychological assessment in current status and future neuropsychological assessment involves the observation and measurement of an behavior in relation to a given stimulus that has been selected for its likelihood to provoke an abnormal response in the presence of neurological this approach incorporates a medical and psychological approach to diagnosis in that both pathology-specific signs and deviations from normal distributions are in the case of disease this methodology has assumed considerable this is because behavioral indicators remain the principal basis for provisional diagnosis when there are no biological observations of elderly persons with and without senile dementia have led to the development of or that are able to assess the functioning of specific cognitive processes affected in ad as opposed to more common age-associated many of these tests have been found to be culturally diagnostic difficulties arise principally from the fact that many neuropsychological tests cannot be used in from uncertainty as to the limits of functioning and from the psychometric problems related to pathological thresholds and the usefulness of neuropsychological testing in the future could undoubtedly be enhanced by the use of measures derived from indices of decline in functioning rather than normative data and the development of functional testing in collaboration with cerebral

transforming growth factor beta production is inversely correlated with severity of murine malaria we have examined the role of the immunomodulatory cytokine transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta in the resolution and pathology of malaria in balb/c circulating levels of and production of bioactive tgf-beta by were found to be low in lethal infections with plasmodium in resolving infections with chabaudi chabaudi or yoelii were accompanied by significant tgf-beta a causal association between the failure to produce tgf-beta and the severity of malaria infection was demonstrated by treatment of infected mice with neutralizing antibody to which exacerbated the virulence of berghei and transformed a resolving chabaudi chabaudi infection into a lethal but had little effect on the course of yoelii parasitemia increased more rapidly in anti-tgf-beta-treated mice but this did not seem to be the explanation for the increased pathology of infection as peak parasitemias were treatment of berghei-infected mice with recombinant tgf-beta (rtgf-beta) slowed the rate of parasite proliferation and prolonged their survival from 15 to up to 35 rtgf-beta treatment was accompanied by a significant decrease in serum tumor necrosis factor alpha and an increase in interleukin we present evidence that differences in tgf-beta responses in different malaria infections are due to intrinsic differences between species of malaria parasites in their ability to induce production of tgf-beta seems to induce protective immune leading to slower parasite early in appears to downregulate pathogenic responses late in this duality of effect makes tgf-beta a prime candidate for a major immunomodulatory cytokine associated with successful control of malaria

chemokine regulation of experimental autoimmune temporal and spatial expression patterns govern disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae) is a cd4+ th1-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that serves as a model for multiple sclerosis there are several considerations that suggest a role for chemokines in the disease chemokines are highly expressed in the central nervous system with a tight temporal relationship to disease in vivo neutralization studies showed a distinct role for specific chemokines in the evolution of the the selective and differential expression of chemokines in differing models of eae bears a close relationship to the patterns of inflammatory the spatial distribution of chemokine expression could plausibly contribute to lesion preliminary observations in ms material suggest that chemokine expression observed in eae may provide useful information regarding the pathogenesis of inflammation in we propose that temporal and spatial expression of chemokines are crucial complementing adhesion molecule that regulate eae disease

plasma kinetic and gene polymorphism of angiotensin i-converting enzyme in we have determined serum activity and kinetic constants of angiotensin i-converting enzyme parallel to an insertion/deletion (i/d) polymorphism in its in french centenarians and controls 20-70 years of age because this enzyme could have an impact on cardiovascular and thus on both the ace d allele and ace d/d genotype were more frequent in centenarians in comparison with without sex-related differences nor significant correlation with a cardiovascular in i/d polymorphism was correlated with circulating ace activity (d/d +/- i/d +/- and i/i +/- the michaelis constants for two substrates were identical whatever the genotype and were not different between centenarians and +/- mmol/l for furylacryloyl-phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine and +/- mmol/l for for the the optimal ph and activating concentration of chloride did not depend on i/d the maximal velocities with both substrates reflected the distribution of serum ace activity as a function of the in centenarians and in in plasma ace activity is subject to a similar genotypic influence in centenarians as in adults 20-70 years of ace itself appears to be functionally similar for each the d allele as well as the higher serum ace activities associated with the d/d genotype cannot discriminate individuals at high risk for cardiovascular major causes of mortality before the age of 100
