oxidative energy metabolism in equine tendon hypoxia has been suggested as a possible cause of tissue degeneration and subsequent rupture in equine to determine whether low oxygen tension is likely to be detrimental to tendon cell experiments were designed to investigate oxidative energy metabolism in freshly isolated and cultured equine tendon freshly isolated tenocytes and cultured fibroblasts possessed activities of the mitochondrial enzyme citrate synthase similar to those of other mammalian with well defined oxidative d-[6(-14)c]-glucose oxidation was measurable in both freshly isolated and explant-derived the content of adenosine triphosphate (atp) in cultured cells was decreased by incubation with a mitochondrial respiratory these data demonstrate that tendon cells are capable of oxidative energy metabolism and rely upon it to maintain cellular atp hypoxia must therefore be considered as a possible factor leading to tendon degeneration and subsequent
fed-batch cultivation of effect of nutrient depletion and heat stress on cell the physiology of a commercial strain of yeast was studied in terms of the cell composition under different growth conditions and of its response to the study comprised fed-batch experiments since this is the system used in yeast the classical fed-batch fermentation procedure was modified in that the yeast cells were continuously grown to a steady-state at a dilution rate of in order to achieve more or less the same initial starting point in terms of cell this steady-state culture was then switched to fed-batch concomitantly with exposure to the highest amount of trehalose accumulation was achieved when nutrient depletion and heat stress were applied the highest amount of was attained in cells stressed by both nitrogen depletion and heat the protein content remained although with some at a value of 30% throughout this dual stress
a cross-cultural breakdown of swedish in this nation-wide study including all immigrant groups in over suicides and undetermined cases occurring during the period 1987-1991 were diagnoses of the underlying causes of death were classified according to all of the alternatives e950-e959 and e980-e989 being definite and overall suicide rates were estimated for each immigrant group we found an overrepresentation of immigrants in the swedish suicide statistics a total of 15 countries (60% of the immigrant population) manifested more observed than expected suicides and undetermined this overrepresentation was statistically significant among immigrants from denmark and norway (the immigrant population of these countries represents nearly 50% of the total population of immigrants in other nationalities with an increased suicide incidence were from the spain and the risk of an immigrant dying of a cause related to suicide was found to be times higher than that for a native the increased suicide rates observed among the immigrant groups in sweden were found to be higher than in the respective countries of origin for 90% of the nationalities including those characterized by a relatively high refugee flow to the rank order being generally the same both in the countries of origin and in the immigrant groups with the highest suicide rates in our study were from finland and suggestions are made concerning the possible involvement of underlying anthropological and genetic factors in this
regulatory role of angiotensin ii on progesterone production by cultured human granulosa expression of angiotensin ii type-2 the role of angiotensin ii (angii) in ovarian steroidogenesis is not clearly in order to study its action on progesterone synthesis and to determine which receptor subtype is granulosa cells obtained from women undergoing in-vitro fertilization were cultured for 2 or 4 days and then incubated in the presence of angii (10(-7) m) with or without human chorionic gonadotrophin 10 iu/ml) for 3 or 18 in cells cultured for 2 incubation with angii decreased progesterone secretion by and inhibited activity of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-hsd) by 87% (p < although its expression was not significantly in cells cultured for 4 progesterone production was enhanced by incubation with angii and no change was observed in 3 beta-hsd both inhibitory and stimulatory effects were progesterone secretion was increased (93%) by incubation with hcg of cells cultured for but not for 2 and no potentiation was observed with treatment with pd123177 completely blocked the action of angii and decreased the hcg-stimulated secretion of progesterone by angiotensin type-2 (at2) receptor mrna was expressed in cells cultured for 4 in angii showed a regulatory role in in-vitro progesterone production by human granulosa luteinized modulating the activity of 3 it is likely that these actions may be mediated via membrane possibly of the at2 receptor
expression of activating transcription serum response factor and camp/ca response element binding protein in the adult rat brain following generalized nerve fibre lesion and ultraviolet the expression of the constitutive transcription factors activating transcription factor-2 serum response factor (srf) and camp/ca response element binding factor and the phosphorylation of srf and creb were studied in the untreated adult rat nervous system and following seizure activities and neurodegenerative in the untreated intense nuclear srf immunoreactivity was present in the vast majority of neurons in the amygdala and and in some scattered neurons in the medulla and spinal in srf immunoreactivity was absent in the midline areas of the the globus pallidum and and in the mesencephalon and nuclear atf-2 was expressed at high levels in apparently all but not glial throughout the neuraxis except for those neuronal populations which exhibit a high basal level of dentate gyrus and the motoneurons of cranial and somatosensory creb immunoreactivity was present at a rather uniform intensity in all neuronal and glial cells throughout the two but not 5 h or 24 following systemic application of kainic an increase in srf was detectable by western blot analysis in hippocampal and cortical homogenates whereas the expression of atf-2 and creb did not phosphorylation of creb at serine 133 and of srf at serine 103 were studied with specific in untreated intense phosphocreb and phosphosrf immunoreactivities labelled many glial cells and/or neurons with the highest levels in the dentate the entorhinal cortex and the retrosplenial following kainate-induced phosphosrf-ir but not phosphocreb-ir transiently increased between h and 2 following transection of peripheral or central nerve fibres such as optic medial forebrain vagal and facial nerve atf-2 rapidly decreased in the axotomized neurons during that period when c-jun was rapidly srf remained unchanged and creb disappeared in some axotomized similar to c-jun increased and atf-2 decreased in cultured adult dorsal root ganglion neurons following ultraviolet the distribution of srf and atf-2 suggests that their putative target genes krox-24 and c-jun can be independently regulated from srf and the suppression of atf-2 and the expression of c-jun following axotomy and ultraviolet irradiation might be part of a novel neuronal stress response in the brain that strongly resembles the stress response characterized in non-neuronal
opposing activities of c-fos and fra-2 on ap-1 regulated transcriptional activity in mouse keratinocytes induced to differentiate by calcium and phorbol the major differentiation products of maturing keratinocytes contain ap-1 regulatory and ap-1 dna binding activity increases in cultured keratinocytes induced to differentiate by we have analysed ap-1 transcriptional activity in mouse keratinocytes treated with calcium and 12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate two agents that induce terminal differentiation of keratinocytes with different phenotypic reporter constructs representing multimers of ap-1 sequences found in keratinocyte marker genes demonstrated that the calcium-induced ap-1 dna binding activity does not correlate with transcriptional expression from active subunits of the profilaggrin and spr 1 promoters increased in calcium-treated keratinocytes when the ap-1 sites were indicating that ap-1 may negatively regulate certain promoters in these in ap-1 reporter activity was increased in keratinocytes treated with this induction was dependent upon the expression of c-fos since ap-1 transcriptional activity was not increased in tpa-treated keratinocytes derived from c-fos null analysis of ap-1 protein expression in calcium- and tpa-treated keratinocytes demonstrated that only tpa increased the expression of while jun b and jun d were induced by both of these c-fos was expressed only in tpa treated fra-2 was expressed only in calcium-treated and fra-1 was expressed in exogenous expression of fra-2 repressed ap-1 transcriptional activity in tpa-treated while c-fos expression activated the ap-1 sequence in calcium-treated these data indicate that fra-2 and c-fos play opposing roles in regulating ap-1 activity in keratinocytes and that multiple inducer-dependent regulatory pathways may exist for the expression of keratinocyte differentiation

expression of hematopoietic cell markers by retinal pigment epithelial we investigated the expression of various isoforms of the hematopoietic cell marker cd45 on retinal pigment epithelial cells in relation to their expression of cd68 and the cytokine-reactive intercellular adhesion molecule-1 we also determined the effect of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1 tnf alpha and ifn gamma on the expression of these molecules by rpe cells in monolayers of rpe cells between 3rd and 7th passages were cultured in the presence or absence of followed by immunohistochemical staining for cd45 (170-220 cd45ra (205 and 220 cd45ro (180 cd68 and using the alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase (apaap) total (membrane and cytoplasmic) expression of each of the three cd45 isoforms was determined by enzyme-linked immunoassays the majority of rpe cells expressed all isoforms of cd45 on their membranes and the pattern of expression of these molecules was not modified by the greatest intensity of membrane staining was consistently observed with antibodies to cd45ra (205 + 220 while cd45 (170-220 kd) showed to be the predominant isoform within the whole as judged by elisa unlike the membrane expression of only 20% of rpe cells stained for the macrophage surface molecule cd68 following 4 h of but progressive increase in the proportion of cd68 positive cells was observed by extending the culture to 24 and 48 neither the expression of cd68 nor the various isoforms of cd45 were modified by incubation with pro-inflammatory staining for icam-1 was observed in 21-25% of rpe cells throughout the 48 h incubation with 50 pg/ml of il-1 tnf alpha and ifn gamma caused a marked increase in the rpe cell expression of icam-1 following 24 and 48 h the observations suggest that hematopoietic cell markers are constitutively expressed on rpe cells and that functions governed by these molecules are not influenced by pro-inflammatory expression of hematopoietic molecules by rpe cells may influence the macrophage-like properties of these cells and may also aid in the identification of rpe cells during pathological particularly in the proliferative where these cells undergo phenotypic and functional
highly porous polymer matrices as a three-dimensional culture system for hepatocyte-based therapies hepatocyte transplantation and extracorporeal support devices) may provide alternative therapies to treat patients with liver but suitable approaches to localize these cells to a given location while maintaining liver-specific gene expression must be the suitability of highly porous three-dimensional sponges fabricated from poly (l-lactic acid) [plla] as an hepatocyte culture system was evaluated in this sponges were fabricated utilizing a particulate leaching and were approximately 95% with an average pore diameter of 180 hepatocytes seeded into these sponges adhered and remained viable for 14 the secretion rate of albumin from these an indication of liver-specific gene was low (approximately 6 pg/cell/day at day and decreased steadily over the 14 days of the coating sponges with and more immobilizing cells within the plla sponges with a collagen led to enhanced cell survival and albumin secretion at all time these data suggest that porous plla sponges may provide a novel system for long-term culture of and proper design of the system may allow the liver-specific gene expression of hepatocytes transplanted in these matrices to be
mesodermal guidance of pioneer axon pioneer axons in insect legs are experimentally accessible model systems for the molecular identification and cellular localization of guidance cues regulating the path of axon a detailed study of the fe2 pioneer axons in the legs of the cockroach was performed to examine the diversity of guidance a detailed microscopic analysis of the axons at various points in their trajectory indicates that the fe2 axons grow on a mesodermal substratum which contains the cues guiding their growth along a stereotyped an identified pair of muscle pioneer cells (mpc) are likely to play an important role in enabling the fe2 growth cones to respond to mesodermal guidance the addition of heparan and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c to the medium perturbs the in situ path of growth of the fe2 axons and the location of the mpc in cultured this indicates a role for heparan sulfate proteoglycans and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins in axon when these results are compared to those of similar experiments performed on the well-characterized ti1 they indicate significant differences in the mechanisms that are used for axon the fe2 neurons are a good model for elucidating the mechanisms used to guide axon growth on nonmuscle mesodermal substrates often encountered in the periphery of vertebrate copyright 1997 academic
dna replication and postreplication mismatch repair in cell-free extracts from cultured human neuroblastoma and fibroblast dna synthesis and postreplication mismatch repair were measured in vitro using cell-free extracts from cultured human sy5y neuroblastoma and wi38 fibroblast cells in different growth all including differentiated sy5y and quiescent wi38 catalyzed sv40 origin-dependent dna totally dependent on sv40 although differentiated neuroblastoma and quiescent fibroblasts cells were essentially their extracts were competent for dna replication using dna polymerases and possibly with proliferating cell nuclear nonreplicative dna synthesis and lesion bypass by either alpha- or beta-polymerases were detected independently in extracts using primed or gapped single-stranded dna long-patch postreplication mismatch repair was measured for the first time in neuroblastoma cell-free extracts from subconfluent and high-density sy5y cells catalyzed postreplication mismatch repair with efficiencies comparable to those of hela cell no significant differences were observed in repair between sy5y differentiated and undifferentiated cell mismatch repair efficiencies were threefold lower in extracts from subconfluent wi38 and repair in wi38 quiescent cells was fourfold less than in subconfluent suggesting that mismatch repair may be the spectrum of mismatch repair in sy5y extracts closely resembled the mismatch removal specificities of hela t g and g g mismatches were repaired most c a a g and a five-base loop were repaired with intermediate repair of g c and t t mismatches was extremely

the beige/chediak-higashi syndrome gene encodes a widely expressed cytosolic the human autosomal recessive disorder chediak-higashi syndrome and its murine homologue beige are associated with the formation of giant lysosomes that cluster near the perinuclear region of we prepared a polyclonal antiserum against a glutathione s-transferase-beige fusion protein and demonstrated by western analysis that the beige gene encodes a protein of 400 kda that is expressed in cultured murine fibroblasts as well as most mouse the protein was not detected in either cultured fibroblasts or mouse tissues from two different beige cultured fibroblasts transformed with multiple copies of yeast artificial chromosomes that contain the full-length beige gene showed much higher levels of beige protein than either wild type fibroblasts or mouse subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrated that the beige protein was cytosolic under the conditions of had no measurable membrane cultured mouse fibroblasts in which the beige protein was overexpressed had smaller than normal lysosomes that were more peripherally distributed than in control these coupled with earlier published suggest that the beige protein regulates lysosomal
human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal (stromal) progenitor cells (mpcs) cannot be recovered from peripheral blood progenitor cell the purpose of this study was to compare the ability to collect human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal (stromal) progenitor cells (mpc) from bone marrow versus peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor cell (pbpc) collections using in vitro and in vivo ten milliliter samples of pbpc collections mobilized from 11 patients undergoing autotransplants using chemotherapy followed by g-csf 5-10 micrograms/kg were evaluated using in vitro and in vivo assays for hematopoietic progenitors and 10 ml samples of unstimulated bone marrow aspirates as well as pbpc collected after mobilization using g-csf 10 micrograms/kg obtained from 3 histocompatible allogeneic donors were analyzed for hematopoietic progenitors and the mpcs were isolated and culture-expanded as adherent cells in vitro and subsequently tested for the capacity to differentiate into mesenchymal phenotypes in vivo using calcium hydroxyapatite porous ceramic cubes implanted in athymic demineralized sections of these cubes were analyzed histologically for the appearance of bone and seven autotransplant subjects with cancer received g-csf after chemotherapy whereas 4 cancer patients and all 3 normal donors received g-csf alone as the mobilizing for the autologous pbpc collections and the normal marrow median hematopoietic progenitor content was in the normal range for our mpcs were detected in in vitro cultures and as bone-positive ceramic cubes in samples of all 3 allogeneic donor bone marrows but in none of the 14 autologous and 6 allogeneic pbpc in mpcs could not be recovered in pbpc collections obtained from either normal donors or patients who underwent pbpc collections after mobilization therapy but could be obtained routinely from bone marrow although the role of transplanted mpcs is an area of clinical this study points out a fundamental differences in the population of cells transplanted after collection from bone marrow versus peripheral
assay of human stem cells by repopulation of nod/scid the only conclusive method to assay stem cells is to follow their ability to repopulate conditioned making it difficult to study human stem the development of systems to transplant human hematopoietic cells into immune-deficient mice lays the foundation for such an experimental repopulation assay for primitive human cell purification and gene marking studies have shown that the repopulating termed severe-combined immunodeficiency (scid) mouse-repopulating cells are primitive and distinct from most of the progenitors that are detected using short and long-term in vitro culture the src are exclusively cd34+cd38- and poorly infected with retrovirus these gene marking data are reminiscent of the human clinical trials establishing that the src assay is a good surrogate to develop improved transduction limiting dilution analysis has been used to establish a quantitative assay for src that can be used to precisely determine the effect of various cytokine cocktails on the proliferation and differentiation of src during in vitro
cultural assessment in home as the nurse becomes adept at performing cultural assessments and culturally competent it will become clear that it is critical to conduct a cultural assessment with culturally and ethnically diverse it is also important to realize that every client needs a cultural every client has and practices that must be considered when a clinician renders healthcare cultural assessments are not limited to specific ethnic but rather should be conducted on each nurses who have been identified as good transcultural nurses have been found to be and they have a positive attitude toward cultural differences and have a genuine interest in learning from the client about the culture talabere (1996) states that appreciation of holistic genuine and a nonjudgmental attitude are central to cultural when a culturally sensitive nurse develops mutually agreeable goals with a patient from another a kind of cultural synergy resulting in care that is satisfying and beneficial to
[beta-hemolytic streptococci in tonsil hypertrophy and recurrent the recurrence of streptococci acute tonsillitis is a complication that often motivates the we studied the colonisation of tonsils and adenoids by pyogenes and other beta haemolytic streptococci in both surgical recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar we made for aerobic culture the following throat tonsils and adenoids tissue corresponding to 47 children referred for pyogenes was isolated in 11 cases of tonsils and other beta haemolytic non a streptococci was isolated in 11 of group c streptococci was the most frequent with six however in the recurrent tonsillitis pyogenes was isolated more significantly (47%) that other beta haemolytic streptococci otherwise in the tonsilar hypertrophy pyogenes was isolated in the 10% while that other streptococci was isolated in the the culture of 38 adenoids yielded pyogenes and beta haemolytic group c streptococci in 6 cases each one pyogenes was isolated more frequently in recurrent tonsillitis that other micro-organisms while that in the tonsilar hypertrophy group predominated streptococci beta haemolytic non aureus and is of interest that the adenoids in our study showed an important reservoir of beta haemolytic the throats swabs yielded less of the half of all beta haemolytic streptococci isolated in tonsilar tissue
expression of the genes for 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and cytochrome p450scc during syncytium formation by human placental cytotrophoblast cells in culture and the regulation by progesterone and we have investigated the expression of cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome p450 (p450scc) and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-hsd) type 1 genes during human trophoblast differentiation in culture and the modulation of their steady-state mrna levels by during the first 24 to 48 h after mononucleated cells forming after 60 h in cell diameters were increased and nuclei appeared centrally distributed within large consistent with syncytiotrophoblast during these striking morphological changes in culture the expression and activity levels of 3 beta-hsd type 1 and p450scc increased significantly as isolated cytotrophoblasts progressed to a differentiated with p450scc and 3 beta-hsd type 1 mrnas activities being more abundant in cells cultured for 48 to 72 in the same the amount of 3 beta-hsd protein decreased during the first 12 to 24 h by 50% compared with freshly isolated trophoblasts but remained at these levels throughout the culture the specific activity of the 3 beta-hsd as determined with pregnenolone or dehydroepiandrosterone was similar but increased with time as syncytiotrophoblast was formed in these observations provide additional evidence that the expression of these two progesterone-synthesizing enzymes is coincident and that they reach their maximum steady-state mrna levels at a time when syncytium formation occurs in incubation of trophoblast cells with progesterone or estradiol increased the abundance of p450scc and 3 beta-hsd type 1 mrnas but had no significant effect on the amount of 3 beta-hsd these observations of the regulation of 3 beta-hsd type 1 mrna levels by steroids suggest a complex relationship of the mechanisms regulating transcription/mrna processing and transduction of the 3 beta-hsd type 1
oligodendrocytes express different isoforms of beta-amyloid precursor protein in chemically defined cell culture in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical the expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaapp) by astrocytes is well data concerning oligodendrocytes remain the main goal of the present study was to determine whether or not oligodendrocytes in culture constitutively express the different betaapp oligodendrocytes were cultured in a chemically defined medium that avoids putative effects of unknown serum factors on oligodendrocyte we have employed immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization with antibodies and synthetic oligonucleotides specific protein epitopes and mrna transcripts of rat betaapp in both mixed primary cultures in the presence of serum or in secondary cultures in defined were clearly labeled by antibodies directed to different betaapp antibodies against the serine protease inhibitor domain of also strongly labelled immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization were combined to determine precisely the expression of different isoforms of in situ hybridization revealed the presence in oligodendrocytes of mrna transcripts coding not only for betaapp695 but also for betaapp770 and this indicates that betaapp immunoreactivity found in oligodendrocytes corresponds to constitutive expression of oligodendrocyte cultured in chemically defined medium are able to express not only betaapp695 but also betaapp751 isoforms containing the kunitz protease inhibitor although the role of betaapp in the pathological processes of disease (ad) remains possible disturbances of betaapp processing and/or synthesis in oligodendrocytes may account for some myelin disorders observed in ad and other senile

culture of adult human islet preparations with hepatocyte growth factor and 804g matrix is mitogenic for duct cells but not for it has recently been reported that human adult beta-cells proliferate during culture on an extracellular matrix prepared from rat 804g cells and in the presence of hepatocyte growth factor the present study compares the mitogenic effect of this condition on human beta-cells and on neighboring non-endocrine duct islet cell-enriched fractions were prepared from adult human organ donors and cultured in suspension or on 804g with or without the combination of 804g matrix and hgf increased the number of (brdu+) cells within 48 h reaching a maximum after 4 in virtually all brdu+ cells were negative for insulin or glucagon and for preproinsulin mrna but expressed the ductal cell markers cytokeratin 19 and carbonic and carbohydrate antigen after 4 days of the cytokeratin 19+ ductal cells exhibited a brdu-labeling index of 30% (p < 2% without hgf and whereas of insulin-positive and <1% of glucagon-positive cells were formation of bilayers with ductal cells covering the endocrine cells may cause erroneous interpretation on double positivity in unsectioned it is concluded that culture of human islet cell preparations with hgf and 804g matrix stimulates the proliferation of the duct cells but not of the underlying
differentiation of cultured keratinocytes promotes the adherence of streptococcus based on a consideration of the histopathology of nonbullous impetigo that shows localization of streptococcus pyogenes to highly subcorneal we hypothesized that adherence of an impetigo strain of pyogenes would be promoted by terminal differentiation of an assay was developed in which pyogenes adhered via pilus-like projections from the cell wall to the surface of cultured human keratinocytes in a time- and inoculum-dependent manner suggestive of a receptor-mediated terminal differentiation of keratinocytes was induced by increasing the calcium concentration in the growth and was confirmed by morphologic analysis using electron adherence of pyogenes was three and fourfold greater to keratinocytes differentiated in and mm compared with undifferentiated keratinocytes in mm the presence of calcium during the adherence assay further enhanced adherence nearly adherence occurred preferentially to sites of contact between adjacent suggesting that the keratinocyte receptor may be a molecule involved in cell-to-cell in nonpathogenic streptococcus gordonii adhered poorly to keratinocytes regardless of their state of terminal and adherence of a pharyngeal strain of pyogenes was twofold greater to undifferentiated than differentiated this is the first report of in vitro adherence of pyogenes to keratinocytes in a manner that emulates human adherence of only the impetigo and not the pharyngeal strain of pyogenes or the nonpathogenic gorgonii was promoted by keratinocyte this result provides a model system for investigating the molecular pathogenesis of streptococcal skin

uptake of long chain fatty acids by human placental choriocarcinoma (bewo) role of plasma membrane fatty acid-binding in order to understand the mechanisms by which fatty acids are taken up by the the uptake of and docosahexaenoic acids by cultured human placental choriocarcinoma (bewo) cells was fatty acid uptake by bewo cells was temperature-dependent and exhibited saturable oleic acid was taken up least and docosahexaenoic acid most by these competitive studies of fatty acid uptake by bewo cells also indicated preferential uptake compared with oleic acid in the order of docosahexaenoic arachidonic and linoleic western blot analysis demonstrated that bewo cells express a protein immunoreactive with antibodies to the human placental plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein pre-treatment of bewo cells with these antibodies inhibited most of the uptake of docosahexaenoic (64%) and arachidonic acids (68%) whereas oleic acid uptake was inhibited only 32% compared with the controls treated with preimmune these results clearly demonstrate that the pfabppm may be involved in the preferential uptake of essential fatty acids (efa) and their long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (lcpufa) by these studies on the distribution of radiolabeled fatty acids in the cellular lipids of bewo cells showed that docosahexaenoic acid was incorporated mainly in the triacylglycerol followed by the phospholipid whereas for arachidonic acid the reverse was the preferential incorporation of docosahexaenoic acid into triacylglycerol suggests that triacylglycerol may play an important role in the placental transport of docosahexaenoic acid to the fetal together these results demonstrate the preferential uptake of efa/lcpufa by bewo cells that is most probably mediated via the we thus propose that the p-fabppm may be involved in the sequestration of maternal plasma lcpufa by the
antigen presentation by t t cell receptor ligation promotes antigen acquisition from professional antigen-presenting the purpose of this study was to determine whether the clonotypic specificity of the t cell receptor influences the specificity of t cell-mediated antigen we have previously shown that myelin basic protein (mbp)-specific lewis rat (r1) t cells cultured with irradiated syngeneic splenocytes (irrspl) and tolerogenic monoclonal antibody become highly effective antigen-presenting cells in the current we investigated the transfer of specific (mbp) and unrelated (conalbumin) antigens from antigen-pulsed spl to r1 t r1 t cells cultured with irrspl that were pulsed simultaneously with both mbp and conalbumin acquired and presented both antigens to the appropriate t cell responders in a secondary these results suggested a physical transfer of major histocompatibility complex (mhc)/peptide complexes from professional apc to r1 t transfer of conalbumin from professional apc to r1 t cells required specific recognition of mbp and was optimal when both conalbumin and mbp were presented on the same group of professional antigens transfer did not occur when allogeneic spl were used as the anti-i-a mab ox6 inhibited antigen transfer but only when added during the initiation of ox6 also inhibited antigen acquisition by a variant of the r1 t cell line which constitutively synthesizes high levels of from mbp-pulsed irrspl but blockade of i-a did not inhibit antigen acquisition when soluble mbp was added directly to the despite constitutive synthesis of r1-trans t cells did not acquire guinea pig mbp from pulsed allogeneic these studies demonstrate that although t cells of a particular specificity can present unrelated the cognate interaction of the t cell antigen receptor with the appropriate antigen/self-mhc complex strongly promotes acquisition of these complexes from professional

degradable and highly porous polyesterurethane foam as effects and phagocytosis of degradation products in a new class of biodegradable phb-based polyesterurethane (degrapol/btc) has been prepared and found to exhibit favorable cell and tissue the present study has been designed to evaluate the response of primary isolated rat tibia osteoblasts to small crystalline particles of short-chain poly[(r)-3-hydroxybutyric acid] (phb-p 2-20 of fluorescent-labeled analogs and of lysine methyl ester as possible degradation products of observations made using confocal microscopy clearly indicate that osteoblasts have the capability of taking up phb-p although in single-cell analysis the number of dphb-p-positive osteoblasts gradually increased up to 16 the fluorescence intensity per osteoblast increased only during the first 4 h after dphb-p and then it retained the 4 h level up to 16 no significant change in the production levels of collagen type i and osteocalcin was detectable after treatment with low concentrations of phb-p for up to 32 in a time- and dose-dependent alteration of the alkaline phosphatase (alp) activity was maximal activity was measured after 4 days of treatment with 2 microg of phb-p/ml (170% of control rat peritoneal macrophages co-cultured with osteoblasts in a transwell culture system mimicked the observed phb-p induced alp the phb-p-induced alp increase could be the result of direct or indirect stimulation of possibly via soluble factors produced by contaminating taken the data demonstrate that osteoblasts are capable of phagocytosing phb-p and that this process is accompanied at low phb-p concentrations by dose- and time-dependent alteration of alkaline phosphatase activity but not of collagen type i or
tenascin-c matrix assembly in oral squamous cell we previously showed that the extracellular matrix component tenascin-c (tn-c) is upregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (scc) compared with the normal oral in this study we examined oral biopsy specimens of mild to moderate dysplasia or carcinoma in situ to study tn-c we found that carcinoma in situ is the stage at which tn-c becomes widely suggesting it may be involved in the initial stages of tumor to study tn-c matrix production in we used an invasive oral scc cell line (hsc-3) and peri-tumor fibroblasts neither cell type organized a tn-c matrix when cultured when co-cultured with hsc-3 ptf were able to assemble a tn-c ptf retained the ability to organize a tn-c matrix when separated from the hsc-3 cells by a semi-permeable indicating that cell-cell contact is not necessary for tn-c matrix organization and suggesting that soluble factors may be ptf were induced to assemble tn-c matrices when grown in medium conditioned by both the ptf and hsc-3 antibodies to fibronectin (fn) and to the first fn type iii repeat blocked both fn and tn-c matrix indicating that tn-c matrix organization is dependent on an fn antibodies to alphav and beta1 integrins also blocked tn-c matrix when seeded onto fn the co-cultures were unaffected by the anti-integrin and anti-fn antibodies and were able to organize a tn-c our results suggest that progression of malignant oral scc is accompanied by an alteration of the normal ecm to one rich in and that the organization of a tn-c matrix is dependent on soluble cues provided by both the scc cells and the
dna repair a potential marker for identification of high risk members in breast cancer breast cancer is the single largest cancer and causes the high rate of cancer mortality among a positive family history of breast cancer is recognized as one of the major risk factors for this the present study evaluates bleomycin (blm)-induced chromosome sensitivity analysis in breast cancer families which provides indirectly a measure of the dna repair defect of each blm sensitivity assay on cultured lymphocytes of 36 familial breast cancer their 85 first or second degree female 36 sporadic breast cancer patients and 40 age- and sex-matched controls (without any family history of cancer) were carried out to measure interindividual variation in their dna repair capacity through mutagen-induced chromosome sensitivity fifty percent of familial breast cancer patients and seven unaffected relatives showed compared to hyposensitive relatives these seven subjects may be considered as high risk
how to use practice guidelines in the intensive care diagnosis and management of unstable practice guidelines are often based on expert and are sometimes based on research but are usually a mix of the goal of this article is to aid in the evaluation of the validity of practice data the agency for health care policy and research practice guideline on management of unstable angina and other relevant primary and synthetic critical appraisal of guidelines requires understanding how guideline developers and summarized the and how they chose the values reflected in their to determine whether guidelines are applicable in our we look for clear and concise recommendations about specific describing common options linked to clinically important guidelines must be considered in light of local and and need to be individualized to different patients and as better evidence and new clinical insights guidelines require the ultimate value of a guideline is determined by evaluating its effect on process of resource and most patient
haemophilus influenzae in lung explants of patients with end-stage pulmonary in order to determine the presence and distribution of haemophilus influenzae in lung tissue we obtained lung explants from 49 lung transplant recipients with cystic fibrosis (cf) (n = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) including emphysema (n = bronchiectasis (n = pulmonary hypertension (n = langerhans cell histiocytosis (n = and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n = analysis was done by selective immunoperoxidase (ip) and by polymerase chain reaction influenzae was cultured from specimens of the lung explants from one cf and one copd ip staining of tissue sections was positive in 24 patients (10 cf eight copd two bronchiectasis and four patients with noninfectious pulmonary ip-positive tissue sections were and ip-negative sections were influenzae was more frequently detected in tissue sections of lung explants from cf and copd patients than from patients with bronchiectasis or noninfectious pulmonary influenzae was diffusely present in the the submucosa of the the the and the alveolar influenzae was localized extracellularly alone and in bacterial and was also associated with macrophages in cf the results of this study demonstrate that influenzae is often present in the lungs of patients with end-stage pulmonary especially cf and copd influenzae is diffusely present in the respiratory epithelium and subepithelial layers of the lungs of these
the effect of extracellular ca2+ on responses to purinoceptor agonists in cultured swine tracheal smooth muscle the effects of extracellular ca2+ ions on purinergic responses were examined in swine tracheal smooth muscle cells (tsmcs) in primary atp (1 microm to 1 mm) and beta-methylene adenosine triphosphate beta-me atp) (100 microm and 1 mm) concentration-dependently increased [ca2+]i in the presence and the absence of extracellular responses to atp (10 microm to 1 mm) in the presence of extracellular ca2+ were significantly larger than those in its absence whereas those to beta-me atp were not significantly different between the presence (n=7) and the absence (n=8) of extracellular responses to atp (1 mm) at extracellular ca2+ concentration ([ca2+]o) of 10 and 5 mm were significantly larger than that at extracellular egta concentration ([egta]o) of 1 mm (p< whereas the responses to beta-me atp (1 mm) at 10 and 5 mm [ca2+]o were significantly smaller than that at [egta]o of 1 mm increasing [ca2+]o to 5 mm after the application of either 1 mm atp (n=4) or 1 mm beta-me atp (n=4) in the absence of extracellular ca2+ (1 mm [egta]o) further increased though the increases in [ca2+]i by agonists in 1 mm [egta]o had been already incubating cells for 300 s in 5 mm [ca2+]o before the application of atp (1 mm) significantly increased the response to the drug than that obtained by incubating cells for 6 sec in 5 mm [ca2+]o before the drug application (p< beta-me atp (1 mm) induced similar responses by incubating cells for 30 or 300 s in 5 mm [ca2+]o to that by incubating them for 6 these results suggest that the effect of beta-me atp in swine tsmcs in primary culture is mainly through ca2+ release and that its effect on ca2+ entry is smaller than other
profiles of amyloid precursor and presenilin 2-like proteins are correlated during development of the mouse the amyloid precursor protein (app) and app-like (aplp) as visualized with the mab22c11 have previously been shown to be associated with radial glia in which are known to promote neurite by northern blot app 695 mrna levels increased steadily over hypothalamic app 770 mrna was transiently expressed at 12 days and aplp mrna was only weakly expressed in the the developmental pattern of app moeities in mouse hypothalamus and in fetal hypothalamic neurons in culture was compared with a presenilin 2 (ps2) related protein using an antibody developed against the n-terminal part of by western blot app and ps2-like immunoreactivity were visualized as a 100-130 and 52 kda an app biphasic increase was observed during hypothalamic development in app immunoreactivity was equally detected in neuronal and glial while ps2-like material was more concentrated in a correlation between app/app-like and ps2-like levels was observed during development in while app was mostly associated with membrane a significant portion of ps2-like material was also recovered from cytosolic fractions in in contrast to native ps2 in cos-transfected the ps2-like material did not aggregate after heating for 90 s at 90 degrees these results indicate a close association between app and ps2-like material during hypothalamic development in and suggest that neuronal and glial cultures may provide appropriate models to test their
effects of prostaglandins on ethanol damage in primary cultured rat several reports demonstrated that ethanol administration impairs the dna synthesis in rat it has been demonstrated that prostaglandin (pg) helps prevent membrane damage by hepatotoxic in this the authors examined effects on the toxicity of ethanol in the primary culture of rat we examined two kinds of dna synthesis and lipid peroxidation in the primary culture of rat hepatocytes were isolated by the collagenase perfusion the rate of dna synthesis was determined by pulse-labelling cultured cells with incorporation of (3h)-thymidine was determined by liquid scintillation dna content was measured by the fluorescence the lipid peroxidation was assayed with the results were as 1) pg family pgi2 & thromboxane b2) stimulated the dna synthesis of hepatocytes (especially pgd2 and 2) ethanol decreased dna synthesis by clear dose-dependent 3) the combined treatment of pgd2 or prevents the decreasing of dna which was induced by 4) in ethanol lipid peroxidation was decreased but pge1 and pga1 were not and 5) pge1 and pga1 decreased lipid peroxidation with from these we concluded that pg could be useful for the treatment of degenerative liver disease and alcohol-induced liver disease in the assumption that further studies on the action mechanisms of pg will
a novel thermostable neutral proteinase from saccharomonospora a novel thermostable neutral called was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from the culture broth of saccharomonospora canescens strain the molecular mass was determined by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be the enzyme exhibits a sharp ph optimum of proteolytic activity at ph nps was completely inactivated with typical for edta and whereas the serine proteinase inhibitor pmsf had no atomic absorption measurements showed that the proteinase binds a single zinc and four calcium the enzyme thermostability was characterized in the absence and presence of added melting tm = 77 degrees c and an activation for the thermal deactivation of the excited protein fluorophores of kj mol-1 were calculated in the presence of 100 mm the ea-value is considerably higher than those obtained for a number of proteinases from microorganisms and was explained by the thermostable structure of the effective radiationless energy transfer from phenol groups to indole rings was 68% of the light absorbed by tyrosyl residues is transferred to tryptophyl side no homology was found after comparison of the nps n-terminal including the first 26 with those of other neutral proteinases from in contrast to the well-known bacterial neutral proteinase thermolysin and related enzymes from nps possesses arylamidase and esterase further crystallographic studies will reveal the structural reasons for this epoxy and epithio pyranosides are inhibitors of the proteinase arylamidase
expression of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (igfbp-1) mrna in embryos and endometrial stromal the objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (igfbp-1) on the interaction between mouse embryos and endometrial stromal cells in co-culture to explore quantitatively the changes in expression of igfbp-1 mrna from endometrial stromal cells cultured alone or co-cultured with a combination of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and southern blotting followed by a densitometric analysis was in co-culture development of embryos was significantly improved and the production of igfbp-1 from endometrial stromal cells was stimulated by the quantitative analysis showed that expression of igfbp-1 mrna in endometrial stromal cells co-cultured with embryos was higher on days and 8 and respectively) than in endometrial stromal cells cultured in intensity of pcr products for igfbp-1 mrna in endometrial stromal cells co-cultured with embryos was higher on day 5 than on days 3 and the expression of igfbp-1 mrna in embryos cultured alone was very in co-culture of embryos with endometrial stromal cells improved the development of embryos and may be associated with the production of igfbp-1 by the co-cultured endometrial stromal a combination of rt-pcr and southern blotting followed by a densitometric analysis appeared to be a sufficiently quantitative method to determine changes in igfbp-1 mrna
a method for long term culture of murine type 2 producing cultures of mouse type 2 astrocytes is difficult as these cells have low proliferative ability when isolated as pure often standard glial culture techniques yield mixed glial cultures from mouse which contain little or no type 2 this has made studies of the nature and activity of type 2 astrocytes a co-culture technique has been established to allow long term culturing of type 2 astrocytes which can be grown in large number and isolated at very high this technique uses co-culture of isolated type 2 astrocytes and their progenitor cells with using this type 2 astrocytes can be grown to high density cultures and maintained in culture for over a year without noticeable change in basic phenotypic aged type 2 astrocytes show increased activity of anti-oxidant enzymes suggesting that these cells have increased resistance to oxidative this method may allow analysis of the development of type 2 astrocytes from progenitor cells and may help to identify the in vivo equivalent of these
independent regulation of cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen expression and cytokine synthesis phenotype during human cd4+ memory t cell although considerable attention has been paid to the development of cytokine synthesis heterogeneity during memory t cell little information is available on how this function is coregulated with homing receptor the development of cd4+ memory t cells in the human provides an excellent model for such since 1) the skin supports both th1- and th2-predominant responses in different and 2) the skin-homing capability of human memory t cells correlates with and appears to depend on expression of the skin-selective homing receptor cutaneous lymphocyte-associated ag in this we used multiparameter facs analysis to examine expression of cla vs and il-2 synthesis capabilities among fresh peripheral blood cd4+ memory t and th1 vs th2 memory t cells generated in vitro from purified cd4+ naive precursors by cyclic activation in polarizing culture among normal peripheral blood t cla expression was essentially identical among the ifn-gamma- vs il-4-producing cd4+ memory clearly indicating the existence of in vivo mechanisms capable of producing both th1 vs th2 skin-homing t in vitro differentiation of naive cd4+ t cells confirmed the independent regulation of cla and all three cytokines regulation that allowed differential production of and cla+ memory these studies also 1) demonstrated differences in regulatory factor activity depending on the differentiation status of the responding and 2) revealed cla expression to be much more rapidly reversible on established memory cells than cytokine synthesis
cytological comparison of leaves and stems of prunus avium shoots cultured on a solid medium with agar or an axillary proliferating clone of prunus avium was subcultured every four weeks on solid ms medium with agar as the gelling vitrification (hyperhydricity) of shoots was induced in one four week cycle with the same medium except that agar was replaced by during culture on the vitrifying the water content of the shoots progressively increased with a parallel decrease in chlorophyll cytological differences between the leaves and stems of the vitrified and normal shoots were detected by light and electron (both transmission and scanning) leaves of vitrified shoots were characterized by lower number of chloroplasts in the palisade parenchyma and by a defective the stems of vitrified shoots had a less developed and lignifled xylem lacked sclerenchymatic areas and showed hypertrophy of the cortical more intense vacuolar activity with evaginations of the chloroplast envelope into the vacuole was noted in cells of vitrified
regulation of sulfotransferase gene expression by glucocorticoid hormones and xenobiotics in primary rat hepatocyte in the rat hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase-a (hst-a) and aryl sulfotransferase iv (astiv) represent two major rat hepatic sulfotransferases that are important to xenobiotic prototypic cyp1a1 and cyp2b/3a inducers regulate rat hepatic sulfotransferase gene expression although not necessarily in a coordinate it has been previously reported that in vivo treatment with cyp1a1 inducer 3-methylcholanthrene (3-mc) suppresses rat hepatic hst-a mrna expression in a dose-dependent hst-a and astiv mrna levels become suppressed or following in vivo treatment with phenobarbital (pb)-like cyp2b/3a inducers or prototypic cyp3a inducers such as glucocorticoid in the whole sulfotransferase gene expression is modulated by members of the hypothalamic/pituitary-adrenal gonadal hormone studies in primary rat hepatocyte culture suggest that prototypic p450 inducers regulate hst-a and astiv gene expression directly at the level of the glucocorticoid-mediated sulfotransferase expression was compared with the regulation of tyrosine amino transferase a gene that is transcriptionally regulated by ligand bound glucocorticoid it was found that lower doses of dexamethasone 10(-7) m) produced concomitant increases in astiv and tat mrna whereas hst-a mrna expression continued to rise as the dex dose was increased through 10(-5) when hepatocytes were co-incubated with dex and antiglucocorticoid/antiprogestin dex-stimulated hst-a mrna expression was not significantly inhibited by but astiv and tat mrna expression were inhibited to a similar the results suggested that like is likely regulated by a classical glucocorticoid receptor mediated whereas hst-a is probably regulated by glucocorticoids via an alternative in contrast to the positive effects of glucocorticoid hst-a and astiv mrna expression was negatively regulated by xenobiotics such as pb-like cyp2b/3a inducers or aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr) agonist cyp1a1 incubation of primary cultured rat hepatocytes with pb or structurally dissimilar pb-like inducers gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane or suppressed hst-a and astiv mrna incubation of primary cultured rat hepatocytes with cyp1a1 inducer beta-naphthoflavone or with archetypic ahr (tcdd) markedly suppressed hst-a and astiv mrna these data suggest that the rat hst-a and astiv genes are positively regulated by glucocorticoid hormones and negatively regulated by xenobiotics as a result of molecular and cellular mechanisms that act directly on the
an in vitro model fails to demonstrate aerosolization of tumor we investigated the ability of pressurized co2 gas to aerosolize b16 melanoma (b16) tumor cells in an in vitro the experimental apparatus consisted of an plastic cylindrical vessel and a compliant latex pouch was attached to the two 5-mm ports penetrated the insufflation and desufflation were carried out through a culture dish containing 20 million b16 cells in liquid culture media was placed at the base within the in the first the vessel was insufflated with co2 gas to a static pressure of 15 or 30 mm hg with the outflow port after 10 the outflow port was opened and the gas was desufflated through a collecting device containing sterile culture in a second a continuous flow of co2 through the vessel was maintained after a pressure of 15 or 30 mm hg was a total of 10 l co2 was cycled through the in both 24 determinations were carried out at each each experimental culture dish was microscopically scanned for 2 weeks for the presence of tumor the third and fourth experiments tested for the presence of aerosolized nonviable tumor cells in the expelled using the model described after 10 mins of 30 mm hg static the co2 gas was expelled directly onto a glass slide and after 10 mins at 30 mm hg static the gas was expelled through a saline-filled soluset (abbott and the residue cytofixed onto a glass each of the five slides per experiment were examined microscopically for the presence of in the first and second no cells or growth were observed in any of the 96 experimental in experiments three and no cells were detected on any of the it was not possible with this model to aerosolize tumor cells in a pressurized co2 our results suggest that aerosolization of tumor cells is not the mechanism of port site recurrences after laparoscopic surgery for malignant
rapid isolation of chromosomal dna from oral streptococci and polymerase chain reaction-oriented restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis for genetic we have extensively modified the published method for the lysis of gram-positive bacteria to isolate chromosomal dna from only 1 ml of oral streptococcal overnight cells were incubated with lysozyme and r nase a in the presence of polyethylene after cells were lysed with sodium dodecyl sulfate and proteinase following ethanol sodium dodecyl sulfate solution was added to the and the pellet was completely dispersed by incubating at 65 degrees the chromosome was purified by extraction over phenol and two regions corresponding to the ribosomal rna (rrn) operon and the glucosyltransferase gene were amplified using the chromosome from streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus by polymerase chain reaction genetic heterogeneity was assessed by restriction fragment-length polymorphism the pcr-rflp analysis readily allowed us to subtype each suggesting that the strategy presented here will provide a useful tool to verify epidemiological studies at the molecular
in vitro exposure to peptidic delta opioid receptor antagonists results in limited previous studies by our group have demonstrated that in vitro exposure to delta-opioid receptor agonists results in a significant whereas in vitro exposure to non-peptidic delta-opioid receptor antagonists results in significant suppression of various immune the present study assessed potential immunomodulation by the peptidic delta-opioid receptor antagonists and ici 174864 using a panel of in vitro immune function splenocytes from female b6c3f1 mice were cultured with the peptides at concentrations of b cell proliferation was quantified following cellular t cell function was assessed by cytokine production following stimulation with anti-cd3 monoclonal natural immunity was assessed by quantitating natural killer (nk) cell activity following a 24-h and macrophage function was assessed by quantification of interleukin-6 (il-6) none of the peptides examined significantly affected b cell production of il-2 by t cells was not consistently affected by exposure to either tipp or but was significantly suppressed at 10 microm ici production of was significantly suppressed by low concentrations of either tipp or and by 10 microm ici il-6 production by macrophages was unaffected except for sporadic incidents of enhanced production in cells exposed to ici nk cell function exhibited a differential pattern of with the greatest degree of suppression observed following exposure to tipp and only slight suppression in cells exposed to either d-tipp or ici these data suggest that peptidic delta-opioid receptor antagonists do not exhibit the same pattern or degree of immunosuppressive activity as the non-peptidic antagonists at equivalent in vitro
characterization of the igf axis components in isolated rat hepatic stellate the insulin-like growth factors i and ii -ii) are circulating peptides known to participate in the regulation of and cellular in the present (days 2-3 of culture) and (days 6-7 of culture) rat hepatic stellate cells (hscs) were analyzed for expression of individual components of the igf northern blot analysis of igf-i messenger rna (mrna) revealed transcripts of and to kb in culture-activated while early cultured hscs did not express igf-i in culture-activated an igf-i secretion of ng/10(6) cells per 24 hours was determined in media from early cultured igf-i was not the igf-i receptor (igf-i-r) mrna expression was three-fold higher in early cultured hscs than in culture-activated by a decrease of igf-i-r expression of hscs in vivo following ccl4-induced liver damage was noted as igf binding proteins (igfbps) were detected in conditioned media from hscs by 125i-igf-i ligand blotting at apparent molecular masses of 24 and 41 to 45 kd that were immunologically identified as igfbp-4 and synthesis of these igfbps increased with time of at neutral no igfbp proteolysis was observed in conditioned media of early cultured and culture-activated whereas at acidic protease activities against igfbp-3 and -4 were igfbp protease activities were completely abolished by inhibitors of aspartyl and cysteine addition of 100 nmol/l igf-i stimulated cell proliferation of early cultured hscs and as measured by [3h]thymidine and in culture-activated proliferation was increased in the presence of 100 nmol/l igf-i in both proliferation it can be concluded that due to a higher expression of the igf-i-r and lower levels of early cultured hscs are more susceptible to the mitogenic actions of igfs than the culture-activated the present data suggest a role for the igf axis components in the initiation rather than the perpetuation of hsc proliferation during hepatic
effects of quinine on the excitability and voltage-dependent currents of isolated spiral ganglion neurons in this work examined how a drug that induces both hearing loss and interfered with the excitability of spiral ganglion (sg) neurons in the membrane potential changes and the modification of the action-potential waveform induced by quinine were studied in sg neurons under current the effects of the drug on voltage-dependent currents in sg neurons were also investigated by the voltage-clamp quinine did not appreciably affect either resting membrane potentials or input resistance at action potentials fired by sg neurons were significantly broadened by the presence of with higher concentrations of quinine (>20 the amplitude of action potentials was also voltage-clamp results demonstrated that quinine primarily blocked the whole cell potassium currents (ik) in a voltage-dependent up to 100 microm of quinine did not appreciably block ik evoked by a test pulse to -35 in ik was significantly reduced with more positive test the concentration needed to obtain 50% inhibition (ic50) was 8 microm for a test pulse to 65 at higher concentrations (>20 quinine also reduced the size of sodium currents (ina) in a use-dependent while leaving calcium currents (ica) relatively compared with the potency of effects on other targets in the inner the relatively low ic50 and the voltage-dependent nature of quinine inhibition on ik suggested that its modulation of the waveform and threshold of action potentials of sg neurons probably was primarily responsible for its ototoxic from the point of view of how neural signaling process is affected by the quinine-induced tinnitus may be explained by its broadening of action potentials while the inhibition on ina may result in hearing loss by making the conversion from excitatory postsynaptic potentials to the generation of action potentials more
the b1-agonist [des-arg10]-kallidin activates transcription factor nf-kappab and induces homologous upregulation of the bradykinin b1-receptor in cultured human lung the bradykinin b1-receptor is strongly upregulated under chronic inflammatory the mechanism and reason are not because a better understanding of the mechanism of the upregulation will help in understanding its potential importance in we have studied the molecular mechanism of b1-receptor upregulation in cultured human lung fibroblasts (imr 90) in response to il-1beta and the b1-agonist we show that treatment of human imr 90 cells by il-1beta stimulates the expression of both b1-receptor mrna and the latter was studied by western blot analysis using antipeptide antibodies directed against the cooh-terminal part of the human we furthermore report the novel observation that the b1-receptor is upregulated by its own agonist which was completely blocked by the specific b1-antagonist indicating an upregulation entirely mediated through cell surface the increased population of b1-receptors was functionally coupled as exemplified by an enhancement of the b1-agonist induced increase in free cytosolic upregulation by the b1-agonist was blocked by a specific protein kinase c b1-agonist-induced upregulation was correlated to the induction of transcription factor nuclear factor kappab (nf-kappab) which efficiently bound to the nf-kappab-like sequence located in the promoter region of the human b1-receptor this correlation was further confirmed by reporter gene assays which showed that this nf-kappab-like in the b1-receptor promoter could contribute to il-1beta and dlbk-induced b1-receptor transcription and by the effect of nf-kappab inhibitor pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate which diminished both b1-receptor upregulation and nf-kappab nf-kappab is now recognized as a key inflammatory mediator which is activated by the b1-agonist but which is also involved in b1-receptor
effect of metabotropic glutamate receptor activation on receptor-mediated cyclic amp responses in primary cultures of rat striatal co-activation of group i metabotropic glutamate (mglu) receptors and adenosine receptors resulted in an augmented cyclic amp response in primary cultures of rat striatal l-glutamate and the selective group i (s)-dihydroxyphenylglycine (s-dhpg) evoked concentration-dependent potentiations of cyclic amp accumulation stimulated by the adenosine receptor with ec50 values of 39 and and maximal augmentations of approximately 350% at concentrations of 100 the s-dhpg potentiation was inhibited by group i mglu receptor antagonists and a protein kinase c ro implicating products of pi hydrolysis in this l-glutamate and s-dhpg stimulated pi hydrolysis in striatal neuronal cultures with similar ec50 values to those observed for the augmentation of neca cyclic amp responses and in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence techniques indicate that group i mglu receptor-evoked potentiations are likely to be mediated via mglu5 which are expressed at high levels in these in contrast to cross-chopped slices of neonatal rat of equivalent the group ii mglu receptor (dcg-iv) was without effect on neca- or forskolin-stimulated cyclic amp responses in primary striatal neuronal this lack of effect might be due to a low level of expression of group ii mglu receptors in cultured striatal copyright 1998 elsevier science
effects of follicle-stimulating hormone on endothelin receptors in cultured rat ovarian granulosa two subtypes of the endothelin (et) receptor (eta and etb) were studied in cultured ovarian granulosa immature 21-day-old female wistar-imamichi rats were implanted with diethylstilbestrol (des) pellets for 5 days and granulosa cells were collected by repeated viable cells or 5 x 10(5)) were cultured with 50--400 ng/ml of ovine nih follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) in the presence or absence of [125i-tyr13]et-1 (50 pm) in 1 ml 5a medium for 72 fsh gradually increased the [125i-tyr13]et-1 binding to granulosa whereas fsh-untreated granulosa cells had no significant the dose of 200 ng/ml of fsh was most effective for [125i-tyr13]et-1 binding for 48-h thereafter revealing a after 48 h of culture with 200 ng/ml of granulosa cells were further incubated with [125i-tyr13]et-1 (10 pm-1 nm) and/or the selective etb receptor agonist (10 pm-1 nm) for 2 h for equilibrium and then the dissociation constant and the maximal binding capacity between receptors and ligands were determined by saturation curve and scatchard plot eta + and eta (sites/cells) showed a and as for et-1 (100 nm) or et-3 (100 nm) suppressed fsh-induced progesterone and 17 beta-estradiol these results indicate that fsh upregulates both eta and etb receptors in des-treated immature rat granulosa with no significant differences between et-1 and and that et-1 or et-3 suppresses fsh-induced ets may affect the granulosa cell function through the eta and etb and the increase in amount of et binding does not reflect et effects on granulosa cell the et receptor plays an important role in the development of the

differential mrna expression and production of interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma in stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells of house-dust mite-allergic optimal culture conditions were established for the analysis of interleukin-4 (il-4) and interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) mrna expression and protein as well as proliferative capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells these culture conditions permitted the analysis of differences in the responses of house-dust mite (hdm) allergic patients and healthy controls after polyclonal and allergen-specific proliferative responses were optimal when pbmc were cultured in whereas for studying mrna expression by rt-pcr and protein production by pbmc should be stimulated in blood holding period influenced the cytokine mrna expression and proliferative capacity of primarily the unstimulated it is thus crucial to isolate pbmc as soon as and in any event no later than 7 hours after blood proliferative responses to dermatophagoides pteronyssinus-extract were observed in hdm allergic patients (mean stimulation index (si) = but not in non-allergic subjects (mean si = after pteronyssinus-specific il-4 mrna expression was significantly (p = increased in hdm-allergic subjects compared to non-allergic no significant differences were found in ifn-gamma mrna expression between hdm-allergic and non-allergic both ifn-gamma (p = and il-4 (p = protein production were increased after pteronyssinus-specific stimulation in hdm-allergic subjects compared to non-allergic our data suggest activation of both th1 and th2-like as well as cd8+ t cells in allergic analysis of possible functional differences in pbmc between allergic and non-allergic necessitates polyclonal and allergen-specific stimulation of proliferative responses as well as cytokine mrna expression and protein production should be studied under optimal culture conditions to highlight the often subtle
investigation into the tensile properties of collagen/chondroitin-6-sulphate the effect of crosslinking agents and artificial skin substitutes based on autologous keratinocytes are being developed for grafting onto burns in order to be used successfully in the these skin substitutes need to have sufficient strength to allow ease of this may be achieved by crosslinking the collagen substratum on which the cells are the influence of potential crosslinking agents on the tensile properties of acellular collagen gels has been including the chondroitin-6-sulphate the water-soluble carbodiimide crosslinking agents 1-ethyl-3-(3-diaminopropyl) carbodiimide and and the putrescine and values for maximum displacement and percentage strain at maximum load were generated by subjecting the samples to a tear propagation incorporation of 20% ch6so4 into collagen gels caused a significant increase in the maximum load and stress at maximum crosslinking treatment with cdi or polyamines had little further and in many cases resulted in a decrease in particular in terms of mechanical the best crosslinking combination proved to be the combination of cdi and with results either improved or maintained when compared with the control no treatment previous experience suggests that the use of cdi as a crosslinking reagent may inhibit infiltration and proliferation of fibroblasts in the substratum and it may be necessary to reach a compromise to obtain the best combination of biological and mechanical properties for artificial skin
partial-pkd1 plasmids provide enhanced structural stability for heterologous protein production in kluyveromyces the stability of pkd1-based vectors in the yeast kluyveromyces lactis was investigated during short- and long-term the vectors carried an expression/secretion cassette consisting of the saccharomyces cerevisiae suc2 gene under the control of the cerevisiae alpha-factor promoter and the first set of vectors contained the entire pkd1 sequence linearized at either the unique ecori or the unique sphi site of the pkd1 during long-term sequential batch culture in selective medium with either invertase activity rapidly dropped while the plasmid-bearing population increased from 60% to this apparently contradictory behavior was due to structural the enzyme restriction patterns of recovered plasmid dna retained the pkd1 band while the band containing the suc2 cassette had decreased substantially in to overcome this structural a vector carrying the pkd1 replication origin and the cis-acting stability locus (lacking the inverted repeats) was employed in a pkd1+ (but otherwise isogenic) with this invertase activity remained constant (for at least 70 while the new vector was significantly more initial invertase activity was substantially lower than that for the vectors containing the full pkd1 southern hybridization confirmed that this decrease was primarily due to reduced copy the results indicate that full-pkd1 vectors may be preferred for batch while partial-pkd1 vectors are more suitable for long-term fed-batch or continuous)
fibroblast growth factor-2-toxin induced differential sensitivity of co-cultured vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial recombinant fgf-2-sap is a mitotoxin consisting of the plant-derived ribosome-inactivating toxin saporin (sap) fused to basic fibroblast growth factor fgf-2-sap targets and kills cells bearing upregulated fgf in fgf-2-sap inhibits smooth muscle cell hyperplasia in models of the present study examined the potential for a differential effect of fgf-2-sap on canine vascular endothelial cells (ec) and smooth muscle cells (smc) separately as well as in a novel co-culture canine vascular smc and ec cultures were established separately and made quiescent once cells reached 80% following the release from growth both cell types were treated with or or sap alone for 48 [3h]tdr incorporation was used to determine the growth response of smc and the co-culture system was created by plating canine vascular smc and ec on either side of a microporous 13 microm thick polyester membrane both cell types were grown to 80% confluence and independently made following the release from growth cells were treated with or or sap negative and positive control groups were untreated wells containing phosphate buffered saline and complete growth after 48 both [3h]tdr incorporation and total dna by fluorometric were quantitated in smc and ec fgf-2-sap showed a concentration-dependent cytotoxicity in both canine smc and ec but cytotoxicity for ec required substantially higher in co-cultured fgf-2-sap significantly decreased both [3h]tdr uptake and total dna content at and 500 ng/ml nm) compared to positive in co-cultured fgf-2-sap decreased [3h]tdr uptake at 50 and 500 ng/ml and total dna content at 500 ng/ml compared to positive neither sap alone nor fgf-2 alone showed a significant effect on [3h]tdr uptake or dna content of either smc or in this unique co-culture which better replicates the relationship between smc and ec in we demonstrated a dose-response range of fgf-2-sap at which both the proliferation and total cell number of but not is significantly these data suggest that fgf-2-sap may have therapeutic utility in inhibiting myointimal hyperplasia in the absence of a deleterious effect on regenerating endothelium following vascular
single tube competitive pcr for quantitation of cmv dna in the blood of hiv+ and solid organ transplant cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant and hiv-infected cmv can also cause asymptomatic an elevated blood viral load as assessed by various methods appears to be a predictor for symptomatic and can be used to identify patients at the highest risk of developing cmv we developed a single tube competitive quantitative pcr assay for cmv using as a competitor a plasmid carrying the target sequence for amplification with an internal the analysis of data from repeated extractions and amplifications of samples showed that the coefficient of variation of the assay was typically less than clinical samples from 14 hiv-infected and 13 solid organ transplant patients were widely varying cmv dna levels were found in with a positive correlation with the measure of infectivity in the leukocytes by quantitative culture on the highest cmv dna content in leukocytes was found in two patients with presumptive cmv in hiv the amount of dna in leukocytes was much larger than in solid organ transplant when standardized for although based on a very limited number of this observation probably points to a difference in the biology of cmv infection in these two categories of susceptible cmv dna was also found in the plasma of some of the patients with a high cmv dna leukocyte the present test should be useful for identifying patients at high risk of developing cmv for monitoring therapeutic efficacy of antiviral regimens and to improve the understanding the pathogenesis of cmv

ethanol transcriptionally upregulates t-pa and u-pa gene expression in cultured human endothelial epidemiological studies have suggested that moderate alcohol consumption reduces the risk of cardiovascular this cardioprotective benefit may be in by promoting fibrinolysis through changes in fibrinolytic components and/or resulting in the decreased risk for coronary artery and eventual myocardial endothelial cells (ecs) play a pivotal role in maintaining normal hemostasis by regulating fibrinolysis through the synthesis of plasminogen activators tissue-type plasminogen activator and urokinase-type plasminogen activator the studies described herein were conducted to determine whether a single brief preincubation (1 37 degrees c) of cultured human umbilical vein ecs (huvecs) with low ethanol will upregulate t-pa and/or u-pa gene expression at the transcriptional using a combination of nuclear transcription run-on assays and transient transfections of cultured huvecs with the ppa/luc promoter nuclear run-on assays showed approximately 2- to 3-fold and approximately 6- to 7-fold increase in the transcription of new t-pa and u-pa in transient transfections of cultured huvecs with the pt-pa363/luc and pu-pa236/luc promoter using demonstrated approximately 4- to 6-fold and approximately 6- to 9-fold increase in luciferase activity for t-pa and these combined results demonstrate that low ethanol transcriptionally upregulates both t-pa and u-pa gene expression in cultured huvecs and provides a molecular basis for the ethanol-induced increase in ec-mediated fibrinolytic activity that may underlie and in to the cardioprotective benefit associated with moderate alcohol
an epidemic of collective conversion and dissociation disorder in an indigenous group of its relation to cultural we describe a collective episode of psychogenic illness in an indigenous group (embera) of geographically isolated from its native homeland and surrounded by non-indigenous the which affected three young adult men and six adolescent was attributed by them to a spell it was designated as ataques de locura (madness attacks) according to their traditional medical and as a conversive disorder with dissociative features by different therapeutic including antipsychotic religious healers and traditional herbal remedies were contact with shamans of the same ethnic on the other proved to be an effective way of dealing with the we interpret the situation as an expression of psychosocial stress secondary to cultural this medical problem bears close resemblance to other specific culture-bound syndromes such as ataques de nervios or possession syndromes and gives clues to ways of dealing with psychogenic expressions of cultural
transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta) and egf promote cord-like structures that indicate terminal differentiation of fetal hepatocytes in primary when fetal hepatocytes were cultured in the presence of transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta 1) and epidermal growth factor some morphological changes were under these cells from typical clusters that hepatocytes adopt in to form cord-like structures similar to the hepatic acinus immunocytochemical analysis of these cells revealed high levels of albumin and cytokeratin phenotypic markers of parenchymal although some of the cells in the cord-like structures presented a cortical ring distribution of f-actin the cord also presented thick peripheral bundles and cells of the tips showed thin stress fibers oriented to the cell typical of a migratory in addition to these morphological flow cytometric analysis of the cells revealed a larger granularity and intracellular lipid content (as a parameter related to liver metabolic in tgf-beta + egf-treated western blot analysis of the albumin levels revealed that both expression and secretion of albumin were increased in egf + tgf-beta-treated all these changes were coincident with an enhancement in the dna-binding activity for hepatocyte nuclear factors and as revealed in gel-shift experiments with nuclear we conclude that a cooperative action between tgf-beta and egf might modulate terminal maturation of fetal
diagnosis of meningococcal meningitis by broad-range bacterial pcr with cerebrospinal we used broad-range bacterial pcr combined with dna sequencing to examine prospectively cerebrospinal fluid (csf) samples from patients with suspected fifty-six csf samples from 46 patients were studied during the year genes coding for bacterial 16s and/or 23s rrna genes could be amplified from the csf samples from five patients with a clinical picture consistent with acute bacterial for these the sequenced pcr product shared to 100% homology with the neisseria meningitidis for one the diagnosis was initially made by pcr of the remaining 51 csf for 50 samples the negative pcr findings were in accordance with the negative findings by bacterial culture and gram as well as with the eventual clinical diagnosis for the the pcr test failed to detect the bacterial rrna gene in one csf the culture of which yielded listeria these results invite new research efforts to be focused on the application of pcr with broad-range bacterial primers to improve the etiologic diagnosis of bacterial in a clinical gram staining and bacterial culture still remain the cornerstones of
the expression of interleukin-6 in the pregnant rat corpus luteum and its regulation by progesterone and interleukin a multifunctional cytokine originally described as a t cell-derived is also produced by different cell and it influences a wide variety of physiological and pathophysiological recent studies further suggest that il-6 has a role in down-regulating hormone production by endocrine organs and can negatively affect the steroidogenic capacity of both ovaries and the aims of this investigation were to examine whether il-6 plays a role in luteolysis more to determine whether luteal cells express the il-6 whether this expression is developmentally and hormonally regulated in and whether the corpus luteum could be a target for il-6 using semiquantitative messenger rna (mrna) encoding both components of the il-6 receptor [the ligand-binding subunit (il-6 r) and the il-6 r-associated signal transducer (gp130)] were found to be highly expressed in corpora lutea throughout in il-6 mrna expression was barely detectable from day 4 through the end of whereas a sharp and abrupt expression of il-6 mrna occurred immediately after although the corpus luteum does not express il-6 mrna during most of it could be induced to express this gene with an in vivo injection of the bacterial in when corpora lutea from day-15 pregnant rats were isolated and maintained in il-6 mrna that was undetectable at 0 h increased in a time-related manner and reached significant levels after 4 h of followed by a similar increase in il-6 protein secreted in the culture isolation of the small and large luteal cells by elutriation indicated that both cell populations can secrete il-6 in the apparent ability of luteal cells to spontaneously express il-6 in together with the lack of il-6 expression during most of led us to examine whether the il-6 gene is silenced throughout pregnancy by luteotropic corpora lutea from day-15 pregnant rats were cultured in the presence of different doses of the synthetic and progesterone and dexamethasone markedly inhibited il-6 mrna whereas 17beta-estradiol had a minimal inhibitory and prl did not affect il-6 mrna in results of this investigation have revealed that the rat corpus luteum expresses the il-6 receptor system and that luteal cells are able to secrete il-6 gene expression is silenced during most of probably by the high levels of progesterone locally produced in the corpus the salient finding that progesterone and glucocorticoid strongly inhibit the expression of il-6 in the corpus luteum suggests that one important luteotropic role of progesterone and glucocorticoids could be to prevent the expression of which might have a deleterious effect on luteal

deficient major histocompatibility complex class ii antigen presentation in a subset of disease tumor disease is a common malignancy of the lymphoid although the scarce hodgkin and reed-sternberg (hrs) tumor cells in involved tissue synthesize major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class ii and costimulatory molecules such as cd40 or it is unclear whether these tumor cells are operational antigen-presenting cells we developed an immunofluorescence-based assay to determine the number of mhc class ii molecules present on the surface of single living hrs we found that in fresh disease lymph node a subset of hrs cells express a substantial number of surface mhc class ii molecules that are occupied by mhc class ii-associated invariant chain peptides indicating deficient loading of mhc class ii molecules with antigenic cultured disease-derived (hd) cell were found to express few mhc class ii molecules carrying clip peptides on the cell surface and were shown to generate sodium dodecyl sulphate (sds)-stable mhc class ii alphabeta in addition to showing deficient mhc class ii antigen presentation in a subset of hrs our results show that the widely used hd-cell lines are not ideal in vitro models for the the disruption of mhc class ii-restricted antigen presentation in hrs cells could represent a key mechanism by which these tumor cells escape immune
ige-sensitization to cellular and culture filtrates of fungal extracts in patients with atopic patients with atopic dermatitis may experience exacerbations of eczema triggered by various inflammatory one mechanism may be ige-mediated reactions to dermatophytes since these patients are more likely to acquire skin infections with dermatophytes and may become this study investigates ige-sensitization to fungi in patients with atopic dermatitis and compares the biologic activity of culture filtrates and cellular fungal the following allergen extracts were provided as culture filtrates and cellular candida fusarium and penicillium in pityrosporum ovale and trichophyton rubrum cultures were included in the test fifteen patients with clinical findings suggesting dermatophytosis and 11 controls were each subject was tested by leukocyte histamine release and skin prick test to each fungal the extracts were separated and reduced by sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by ige-immunoblotting with sera from all study fourteen patients (93%) reacted to one or several fungal extracts by releasing histamine when challenged in by immunoblotting patient sera showed binding to a wide range of components in all patient sera recognized allergenic components shared by culture filtrates and cellular extracts but with higher frequent and greater intensity in culture although culture filtrates generated more frequent and potent ige-reactions than the cellular the difference was not statistically biologic potency was similar when evaluated by skin prick tests and leukocyte histamine patients with atopic dermatitis may develop specific ige-antibodies to a number of fungi as demonstrated by in selected fungi may trigger an ige-mediated reaction that may contribute to the exacerbation of one-half of the produced ige-antibodies to fungal (glyco)proteins without a significant histamine release or skin test response possibly because of nonspecific interaction with carbohydrate moieties on ige and poor biologic activity of ige antibodies directed to cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants of fungal this warrants caution when interpreting clinical relevance of serologic measurements of fungal
