subcutaneous abdominal fat and thigh muscle composition predict insulin sensitivity independently of visceral whether visceral adipose tissue has a uniquely powerful association with insulin resistance or whether subcutaneous abdominal fat shares this link has generated controversy in the area of body composition and insulin an additional issue is the potential role of fat deposition within skeletal muscle and the relationship with insulin to address these the current study was undertaken to measure body aerobic and insulin sensitivity within a cohort of sedentary healthy men (n = 26) and women (n = the who ranged from lean to obese (bmi underwent dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (dexa) to measure fat-free mass (ffm) and fat mass computed tomography to measure cross-sectional abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose and computed tomography (ct) of mid-thigh to measure muscle cross-sectional muscle and subcutaneous insulin sensitivity was measured using the glucose clamp technique (40 in conjunction with [3-3h]glucose isotope maximal aerobic power (vo2max) was determined using an incremental cycling insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (rd) ranged from to rd was negatively correlated with fm (r = visceral fat (r = subcutaneous abdominal fat (r = and thigh fat (r = and positively correlated with muscle attenuation (r = and vo2max (r = p < in addition to manifesting the strongest simple correlation with insulin in stepwise multiple subcutaneous abdominal fat retained significance after adjusting for visceral while the converse was not muscle attenuation contributed independent significance to multiple regression models of body composition and insulin and in analysis of obese muscle attenuation was the strongest single correlate of insulin in as a component of central subcutaneous abdominal fat has as strong an association with insulin resistance as visceral and altered muscle suggestive of increased fat is an important independent marker of insulin resistance in
[development of a gait trainer with regulated servo-drive for rehabilitation of locomotor disabled the aim of the present study was to develop a new gait trainer for the rehabilitation of non-ambulatory for the simulation of the gait we used a commercially available fitness trainer (fast track) with two foot plates moving in an alternating fashion and connected to a servo-controlled propulsion system providing the necessary support for the movement depending on the impairment to compensate deficient equilibrium the patient was suspended in a harness capable of supporting some of his/her video analysis of gait and the kinesiological emg were used to assess the pattern of movement and the corresponding muscle which were then evaluated in healthy spinal cord injured and stroke patients and compared with walking on the flat or on a walking on the gait trainer was characterised by a sinusoidal movement of lower amplitude than in normal the emg showed a low activity of the tibialis anterior while the antigravity muscles were clearly activated by the gait trainer during the stance in the new gait trainer generates a symmetrical gait-like promoting weight acceptance in the stance which is important for the restoration of walking
stress fractures in female management and stress fractures are a common overuse injury among the incidence of stress fractures among females is higher in the but this difference is not as evident in the athletic the history of the patient with stress fracture is typically one of insidious onset of activity-related if the patient continues to the pain may well become more severe or occur at an earlier stage of as well as obtaining a history of the pain and its relation to it is important to determine the presence of predisposing on physical the most obvious feature is localised bony swelling or periosteal thickening may be present at the site of the stress the diagnosis of stress fracture is primarily a clinical if the diagnosis is various imaging techniques can be used to confirm the in the majority of stress there is no obvious abnormality on plain although the triple phase bone radiograph is extremely the fracture itself is not visualised and it may be difficult to precisely locate the especially in the the radionuclide scan will detect evolving stress fractures at the stage of accelerated so the findings must be closely correlated with the clinical the characteristic bone scan appearance of a stress fracture is of a sharply marginated area of increased usually involving one cortex of the computerised tomography scanning is a helpful addition if the fracture needs to be or to distinguish between a stress reaction and stress magnetic resonance imaging (mri) is being used increasingly as the investigation of choice for stress the typical findings on mri are of periosteal and marrow as well as fracture the basis of treatment of a stress fracture involves rest from the aggravating most stress fractures will heal in a straightforward and return to sport occurs within 6 to 8 the rate of resumption of activity should be influenced by symptoms and physical when free of the aggravating activity can be resumed and slowly it is important that the athlete with a stress fracture maintain fitness during this period of the most commonly used methods are upper body weights and water there are a number of specific stress fractures that require additional treatment because of a tendency to develop delayed union or these include stress fractures of the neck of the anterior cortex of the navicular and second and fifth an essential component of the management of stress as with any overuse involves identification of the factors that have contributed to the injury where correction or modification of some of these factors to reduce the risk of the injury stress fractures are more common in female athletes with menstrual this may be due to the effect on bone the role of hormonal replacement in the management of these athletes is unclear at this
cardiovascular disease in patients with dysvascular cardiovascular diseases are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in individuals with peripheral vascular disease among patients who have undergone lower extremity amputation as a result of the prevalence of concomitant cardiovascular disease may be as high as comorbid heart disease may complicate the postamputation course of delay initiation of rehabilitation and inhibit the achievement of maximal functional a variety of methods have been used to assess cardiac status and risk in amputation patients undergoing physical these have included clinical resting and continuous dynamic electrocardiography during either standard physical therapy exercise or adapted several conditioning training programs have been developed to improve the cardiovascular fitness of patients with dysvascular the results of which have been these assessment and intervention strategies have extensive applicability in the clinical management of patients with dysvascular

evolution of competitive fitness in experimental populations of what makes one genotype a better competitor than an important problem in microbial ecology is to identify those phenotypic attributes that are responsible for competitive fitness in a particular thousands of papers have been published on the and molecular genetics of escherichia coli and other bacterial little is known about what makes one genotype a better competitor than another even in such well studied we review experiments to identify the phenotypic bases of improved competitive fitness in twelve coli populations that evolved for thousands of generations in a defined in which glucose was the limiting after the average fitness of the derived genotypes had increased by approximately 50% relative to the based on competition experiments using marked strains in the same the growth kinetics of the ancestral and derived genotypes showed that the latter have a shorter lag phase upon transfer into fresh medium and a higher maximum growth competition experiments were also performed in environments where other substrates were substituted for the derived genotypes are generally more fit in competition for those substrates that use the same mechanism of transport as which suggests that enhanced transport was an important target of natural selection in the evolutionary all of the derived genotypes produce much larger cells than does the even when both types are forced to grow at the same some but not of the derived genotypes also have greatly elevated mutation efforts are now underway to identify the genetic changes that underlie those phenotypic especially substrate specificity and elevated mutation rate for which there are good candidate identification and subsequent manipulation of these genes may provide new insights into the reproducibility of adaptive the importance of co-adapted gene and the extent to which distinct phenotypes substrate specificity and cell size) are affected by the same
associations between skeletal muscle physical physical activity and coronary heart disease risk factors in high physical fitness and physical activity are associated with favourable lipid especially a high level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol a skeletal muscle metabolism and percentage of different muscle fibres which may modify coronary heart disease (chd) risk such as serum obesity and serum sex hormones may also influence his fitness level and leisure-time physical we studied the associations of physical physical activity and st-% with serum lipids and lipoproteins in 72 healthy their parameters were compared with those of 20 men with defined significant interrelationships between fitness and leisure-time physical activity index (ltpai) were multiple regression analysis showed that fitness and leisure-time physical activity explained about 32% of the variation in hdl-c in the healthy in healthy men st-% correlated positively with fitness (r(s) = p < and with ltpai (r(s) = p < fitness level also correlated significantly with ltpai (r(s) = p < serum insulin showed negative associations with st-% (r(s) = p < and fitness (r(s) = p < and ltpai (r(s) = p < free fraction of testosterone correlated negatively with serum hdl-c level (r(s) = p < with fitness (r(s) = p < and with ltpai (r(s) = p < in sedentary men with the lowest fitness and physical activity the mean of st-% (45%) was similar to that in chd patients st-% in men in the highest tertile of physical activity and fitness (68%) was significantly higher than in chd patients and in men in the lowest tertile of physical activity and skeletal muscle enzyme activity in lipid metabolism was significantly lower in both chd patients and in sedentary and low-fit men than that in fitter and physically active the present data imply that skeletal muscle properties are important determinants of risk such as physical fitness and serum lipid and lipoprotein although fitness is a independent predictor of mortality from a relatively high fitness level is not this was clearly observed in the clustering in which the healthy according to their leisure-time physical activity and serum sex hormone binding globulin fell into three natural (i) inactive men with lowest st-% (mean lowest fitness mets) and lowest hdl-c (ii) fit men with high st-% high fitness mets) and moderately high hdl-c (iii) active men with high st-% highest fitness mets) and highest serum hdl the results support the idea that both fitness and physical activity give further protection against chd by modifying risk our findings also suggest that skeletal muscle properties should be considered in the studies which assess chd risk factors and their modifications especially in the field of health-related
energy expenditure and physical fitness in overweight vs non-overweight prepubertal to determine whether overweight children have lower physical activity energy expenditure (ee) and fitness levels than non-overweight study twenty-four healthy girls aged 7-10 y were divided into overweight (> 95th percentile weight-for-height) and non-overweight (10-90th percentile) basal metabolic rate sleeping metabolic rate 24 h sedentary ee (see) and total ee (tee) were measured by room respiration calorimetry and doubly labelled physical activity ee and physical activity level (pal) were fitness (vo2peak) was measured by a treadmill exercise the overweight group had significantly higher body percent fat mass and fat-free mass (ffm) (p < the overweight girls had higher see and tee (p < but not after adjustment for physical activity ee and pal were not significantly different between after adjusting for ffm or submaximal and peak vo2 were not significantly different between we conclude that these overweight girls do not have lower physical activity ee or fitness levels than the non-overweight prepubertal the rather high body fat of the non-overweight group may have precluded us from finding any differences between
[functional fitness and related factors in community-dwelling to examine the association of level of functional fitness to and life behavioral or social cross sectional data were obtained for 737 persons aged 60 years or and who were independently living in the functional fitness was measured with a functional fitness test containing 4 task hand and self-care among the demographic statistically significant associations with functional fitness were found for age in both male and female and for the presence of spouse in health previous or present history of circulatory diseases and musculo-skeletal diseases were significantly associated with lower levels of functional fitness in and previous or present history of musculo-skeletal diseases and presence of higher obesity associated with lower fitness level in with life men who had habitual exercise activities and women who had no habitual nap but habitual exercise activities and frequent out-of-home activities showed significantly higher fitness level than their these results suggest that level of functional fitness in independently living aged people in the community was significantly associated with the presence of history of circulatory and musculo-skeletal and habitual exercise activities in and with the history of musculo-skeletal and habitual exercise and frequent out-of-home activities in
