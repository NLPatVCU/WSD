proliferative responses to recall antigens are associated with pregnancy outcome in women with a history of recurrent spontaneous abortion [published erratum appears in j clin invest 1998 jan maternal tolerance of the fetal hemiallograft suggests that immunomodulation occurs during recurrent spontaneous abortion (rsa) may represent a failure of the immune changes that maintain we hypothesized that fertile women but not women with rsa may lose their immune responses to recall antigens when this phenomenon has been seen in immunosuppressed transplant recipients and is associated with graft we evaluated proliferative responses to recall antigens in four groups of group nonpregnant fertile women with no history of pregnancy loss and at least one prior healthy n = group nonpregnant women with a history of three or more spontaneous n = group healthy pregnant women between 6 and 9 wk of gestation without a history of prior pregnancy n = and group pregnant women between 6 and 9 wk of with a history of n = proliferative responses of peripheral blood leukocytes to the recall antigens influenza and and phytohemagglutinin were determined positive responses (stimulation index > 3) to recall antigens (a response to either influenza or tetanus was considered positive) were as group 1 (nonpregnant fertile 11/13 group 2 (nonpregnant rsa 24/28 group 3 (pregnant fertile 4/15 (27%) (p </= and group 4 (pregnant rsa 13/22 (59%) (p = in group there was 100% fetal survival in the nine women who lost responsiveness to recall in the 13/22 patients who responded to recall 9/13 (69%) had a repeat spontaneous these findings suggest that indirectly measured by proliferation to recall is necessary for early pregnancy this approach may be useful for predicting pregnancy outcome for women with rsa and may provide a useful means for designing and monitoring
recurrent vascular thrombosis in an adolescent transplant vascular thrombosis is one of the more difficult problems of pediatric renal its etiology in multifactorial in most it is vascular thrombosis accounts for of graft failures in primary transplants in children and for 20% of graft failures in repeat although it is seen most often in very young recipients and in recipients of kidneys from young it can manifest in older children and adolescents as the peak incidence is seen in the first 48 h after the event may be delayed until after the first when thrombosis occurs in an adolescent patients late in the course of the pathogenesis is undetermined and immunosuppressive therapy is frequently this article describes a 19-yr-old patient with a three-antigen-matched cadaveric kidney who received cyclosporine and anti-thymocyte globulin for vascular thrombosis occurred after 7 d of initial good eventually the graft was removed after attempts to re-establish vascularization the patient received a second graft and despite an optimal six-antigen-match and different immunosuppression with thrombosis recurred by the fifth postoperative the discussion that follows reviews the incidence and the factors implicated in the pathogenesis of this
the effect of chronic alcohol use on the heart before and after transplantation in an experimental model in the alcohol has potential deleterious effects on donor heart this study was conducted in rats to determine whether long-term alcohol ingestion produces impaired hemodynamic performance while maintaining a normal left ventricular ejection fraction in donor hearts before transplantation and whether donor cardiac function is affected after heart rats fed 30% alcohol in their drinking water for 12 weeks were compared with rats fed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction was measured by echocardiography with simpson and single plane dodge formulas in living sedated rats after 10 and 12 weeks of alcohol explanted heart function was assessed before and 3 days after heterotopic heart transplantation (no immunosuppression) with a langendorff blood ethanol levels at 4 and 8 weeks were +/- and +/- left ventricular ejection fraction was similar in the group fed an alcohol diet for 12 weeks when compared with the control group +/- +/- p = explanted alcohol-fed hearts before transplantation had significantly lower maximum and developed pressures and had a blunted response to ml 10(-9) mol/l after transplantation alcohol-fed hearts had significantly lower maximum and developed pressures and decreased maximum rates of pressure rise and pressure allografts (aci to lewis) exhibited decreased function in comparison with isografts (aci to alcohol feeding for 12 weeks in rats does not affect pretransplantation left ventricular ejection but it impairs explanted heart both before and after resulting in a subclinical cardiomyopathy that is worsened by the presence of allograft long-term alcohol exposure and rejection have additive detrimental effects on left ventricular performance of the transplanted alcohol-exposed hearts may not be suitable
peripancreatic fluid detection of early rejection versus graft pancreatitis after canine pancreatic it is particularly difficult to distinguish between early rejection and graft pancreatitis when early rejection produces an elevated serum amylase in this study we determined whether peripancreatic fluid cytology (pfc) can differentiate early acute rejection and graft pancreatitis as an alternative diagnostic tool to graft biopsy that has the potential of pancreatic fistula and sixty-two dogs received either a segmental pancreas allograft (n = 25) or autograft (n = 37) heterotopically in the this study included five allografts without immunosuppression (group n = allografts with immunosuppression (group n = autografts without immunosuppression (group n = autografts with immunosuppression (group n = and autografts treated by 45 minutes of pretransplant warm ischemia to induce acute graft pancreatitis (group n = a closed suction drainage catheter was placed next to the graft to collect peripancreatic fluid daily after the pfc was performed using may-gruenwald-giemsa double-staining technique and compared to the corresponding histology through the observation in analyses of 50 functioning pfc performed on day 1 showed similar neutrophil accumulations in all in sharp on days 3 and group a had dramatically increased mononuclear cell concentrations in whereas groups and d showed significantly lower the percent of mononuclear cells among total leukocytes being +/- +/- +/- and +/- (day and +/- +/- +/- and +/- (day 6) in groups and on the other in group e numerous degenerating neutrophils with a marked to moderate increase in necrotic tissue fragments were observed by pfc on days 3 and in terms of graft histology on days 3 and group a showed interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration indicating an acute rejection whereas groups and d had minimal inflammatory cell in group e graft pancreatitis was histologically confirmed on days 3 and these results suggest that pfc after pancreas transplantation could be a useful diagnostic tool for discriminating early graft rejection from graft
quantitative polymerase chain reaction for human herpesvirus diagnosis and measurement of epstein-barr virus burden in posttransplant lymphoproliferative human herpesviruses can cause acute diseases such as chicken pox or but also may reactivate during immunosuppression and result in severe or life-threatening illnesses such as shingles or lymphoproliferative we report the development and validation of a quantitative pcr method to measure viral burden for all eight human herpesviruses and kshv) in the method uses an internal standard that is coamplified with the viral allowing quantification of viral genomes in absolute terms viral targets/ml of blood) and ruling out false-negative we demonstrate that transplant patients with lymphoproliferative disorder carry an ebv viral burden 3 logs higher than nontransplant ebv titers in transplant patients without a lymphoproliferative disorder are between these this quantitative pcr method may aid in differentiating clinically significant vs latent viral burden in immunosuppressed
treatment of acute rejection in live related renal allograft a comparison of three different we present our experience on the comparison of three different modes of steroid oral prednisolone intravenous dexamethasone (ivdx) and intravenous methylprednisolone (ivmp) in the treatment of acute rejection (ar) in renal allograft between january 1980 and january 206 patients underwent live related renal before all received prednisolone (pred) and azathioprine (aza) after patients were given aza and cyclosporine after 1 csa was stopped and patients were converted to a two-drug regimen of the 206 180 were male and mean age was years (range during the mean follow-up of 178 episodes of ar were seen in 121 each episode was considered as a separate entrant in the conventional immunosuppression was given in 151 episodes and 27 episodes were on triple-drug diagnosis of ar was made by nuclear scan with or without graft biopsy of the 178 110 were within 3 36 were between 3 months and 1 year and 32 (18%) were after 1 op was given in 11 cases while ivdx and ivmp were given in 48 and 119 cases 154 (86%) showed either a complete or partial response to antirejection response to therapy was 90 and 85% in ivdx and ivmp groups there was no statistical difference in response rate in different there was also no difference in side effects in three different our data suggest that it is the high dose of steroid rather than mode of therapy which is responsible for therapeutic benefit in treatment of

a model of human anti-t-cell monoclonal antibody therapy in scid mice engrafted with human peripheral blood a chimeric severe combined immunodeficient mouse engrafted with human peripheral blood (hu-pbl-scid) model has been developed to test anti-t-cell monoclonal antibody (mab) effects on systemic symptoms of the host and the survival of human skin to obtain consistent engraftment without lethal acute graft-versus-host disease scid mice were pretreated with a combination of total body irradiation day 0) and anti-asialo gm1 (anti-mouse natural killer cell) antiserum (50 micrograms day 3) before the intraperitoneal injection of 40-50 x 10(6) human pbl on day with this the engraftment rate was 82% with 5-98% human cd45-positive cells in the peripheral mortality at 30 days was 0% in the mice bearing 5-50% human cells compared with 70% in those with more than using hu-pbl-scid mice with 5-50% human cells in their peripheral we demonstrated the following 1) human t cells isolated from these mice proliferated in response to immobilized okt3 stimulation in 2) hu-pbl-scid mice but not normal scid mice were able to reject human skin grafts in vivo 16-21 days after 3) both okt3 (anti-human cd3 mab) and t10b9 (anti-human alpha beta t-cell receptor mab) treatment prevented human skin graft rejection in hu-pbl-scid 4) okt3 but not t10b9 induced first dose reactions characterized by hypothermia and hypoactivity which were consistently observed within 90 min of intravenous injection into hu-pbl-scid 5) human cytokines were detected in the serum of the hu-pbl-scid mice treated with anti-t-cell the close similarity of these responses to human clinical mab immunosuppressive therapy suggests that the hu-pbl-scid mouse model may be an excellent tool for investigating the side and mechanism of action of agents that are specific for human and higher apes and not reactive with lower
respiratory infections in patients with hiv changes in epidemiology have influenced the spectrum of pulmonary diseases in hiv-infected the increasing proportion of patients with aids who are intravenous drug users and members of racial or ethnic minorities correlate with increasing cases of bacterial pneumonia and both of these infections also occur more frequently with advanced antipneumocystis prophylaxis is also reducing the incidence and mortality rate from this but when respiratory failure occurs with pneumocystis carinii the mortality rate is immunosuppression due to hiv causes active tuberculosis in and tuberculosis appears to accelerate the course of hiv directly observed therapy of tuberculosis has made a major impact on the incidence and cure rates of tuberculosis in areas of high pulmonary disease has been a major cause of illness and death in patients with hiv infection since the beginning of the aids early in the carinii pneumonia was considered the predominant pulmonary epidemiologic shifts and advances in treatment have broadened our perspective on the diseases that patients with hiv infection
augmentation of natural killer cell activity induced by cytomegalovirus infection in mice treated with comparable rates of patient and graft survival after fk506 and cyclosporine treatments have been reported in the prevention of liver allograft on this we examined the effect of fk506 on pathogenesis of cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection in fk506 induced apparent immunosuppression in mice which could be monitored by the level of antibody the effective dose of trinitrophenyl-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (tnp-klh) for 50% reduction in antibody production was even in such an immunosuppressed status at this or higher dose of cmv infection was relatively which was observed by the frequency of virus isolation and the mean virus titer of the lungs of mice treated with mg/kg fk506 in comparison to untreated the dose of fk506 attaining 50% frequency of lung infection was the activity of natural killer (nk) cells was enhanced in infected this enhancement was stronger in infected mice treated with fk506 at mg/kg and 10 mg/kg than in untreated infected mice on day 3 post infection an immunosuppressant fk506 augmented inducible nk cell activity and alleviated mcmv infection even under

sirolimus in although sirolimus (srl) alone was very effective in rodents and it produced toxic side effects in low doses of srl combined with cyclosporine/brequinar (csa/bqr) combinations achieved potent immunosuppression in the csa-resistant mouse srl/csa/bqr therapy protected kidney allografts from rejection in dogs without producing toxic side in the csa-sensitive rat model srl/csa combinations produced a potent synergistic in recent clinical trials document the beneficial effects of low srl doses in human kidney transplant when combined with standard immunosuppressive remarkably reduces the incidence of acute rejection and permits individual drug dose
the use of endogenous antioxidants to improve the skin possesses an elaborate antioxidant defence system to deal with uv-induced oxidative excessive exposure to uv can overwhelm the cutaneous antioxidant leading to oxidative damage and ultimately to skin immunosuppression and premature skin an interesting strategy for photoprotection is the support of the endogenous antioxidant this can be accomplished by induction or transdermal delivery of the various antioxidant such as glutathione or superoxide supplementation of non-enzymatic antioxidants such as ascorbate and beta-carotene was also found to be very effective in although treatments with single components of the antioxidant system were successful against a wide variety of the balance between the different antioxidants in the skin is very in some it was found that too much of a single component could even have deleterious the most promising results were obtained in studies combining several often resulting in synergism of the protective
proliferative response of human t lymphocytes to porcine fetal brain intracerebral grafting of porcine fetal brain cells is a potential treatment of neurodegenerative disorders in although it is well known that the survival of fetal pig brain cells in the rat brain requires the response of human t lymphocytes to fetal pig brain cells is here we report on the proliferative response of human t lymphocytes to freshly isolated cells and 14-18 days cultured cells from 28- or 35-day-old porcine fetal after 5 days of mixed lymphocyte-brain cell we observed no or only minor t cell responses to the freshly isolated brain while both cd4 cells and cd8 cells proliferated in response to the cultured brain pretreatment of the cultured brain cells with heat-inactivated human serum significantly reduced the proliferative t cell the data suggest that the porcine fetal brain contains cells that can stimulate the human cellular immune and that this stimulation may be reduced by pretreatment of the fetal pig brain cells with human
predictors and outcome of early- versus late-onset major bacterial infections in liver transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus (fk506) as primary major bacterial infections and the predictors of early (within 100 days of transplantation) versus late onset (after 100 days post-transplant) bacterial infections were prospectively assessed in 130 consecutive liver transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus (fk506) as primary the median follow-up period was 38 35% (45/130) of the patients developed 67 episodes of major bacterial infections sixty-three percent of the major bacterial infections occurred and 37% occurred in the late post-transplant eighty-four percent of the abdominal infections occurred whereas 38% of the cases of 60% of the cases of primary and 50% of the biliary infections occurred by logistic regression portal vein thrombosis was the most significant independent risk factor for early-onset major bacterial infection (odds ratio 95% ci and recurrent hepatitis c was the most significant independent predictor of late-onset major bacterial infections (odds ratio 95% ci sources and risk factors differ for early versus late-onset bacterial infections after liver knowledge of the differences in the potential the and the predictors of early versus late-onset bacterial infections can be valuable in the evaluation and empiric treatment of liver transplant recipients with bacterial
a tacrolimus-related immunosuppressant with reduced tacrolimus (fk506) has potent immunosuppressive properties reflecting its ability to block the transcription of lymphokine genes in activated t cells through formation of a complex with fk506 binding which inhibits the phosphatase activity of the clinical usefulness of tacrolimus is by severe adverse including neurotoxicity and although this like appears mechanistically related to the calcineurin inhibitory action of the a large chemistry effort has been devoted to search for tacrolimus analogs with reduced toxicity but preserved immunosuppressive activity that might have enhanced therapeutic we report on the identification of such an which was synthetically derived from ascomycin the c21 ethyl analog of by introducing an indole group at the c32 the profile of biological activity of indolyl-asc was characterized in rodent models of immunosuppression and indolyl-asc was found to exhibit an immunosuppressive potency equivalent to that of tacrolimus in t-cell activation in vitro and in murine transplant even though indolyl-asc bound about 10 times less to intracellular fk506 binding protein-12 than tacrolimus or further evaluation of indolyl-asc revealed that it is threefold less potent than tacrolimus in inducing a response that may reflect and in causing gastrointestinal transit alterations in indolyl-asc was at least twofold less nephrotoxic than tacrolimus upon 3-week oral treatment in these data indicate a modest but definite improvement in the therapeutic index for indolyl-asc compared with tacrolimus in rodent
characterization of the immune response after local delivery of recombinant adenovirus in murine pancreas and successful strategies for the pancreas is an ideal organ for adenoviral gene therapy because of the high level of gene transfer that can be achieved and because of the many diseases that can potentially be treated using this in this we characterize the immune response to direct pancreatic injection of adenovirus and we overcome some of the limitations it imposes by using direct injection of recombinant adenovirus into the pancreas leads to the production of neutralizing antibodies and to sensitized splenocytes which engage in increased and cytokine release activity when reexposed to transgene expression is transient and the vector cannot be deletion of cd4+ t helper cells improves expression over time (40% of pancreatic cells express transgene at day 28 5% in and allows the vector to be readministered in the when compared to naive blockade of cd40 which preserves the cd4+ t helper cell also improves expression over time (30% of pancreatic cells express transgene at day and allows the vector to be with both neutralizing antibodies are decreased and the remaining splenocytes do not engage in activated immune local delivery of the adenoviral vector induces a systemic response that prevents pancreatic even with direct blockade of cd40 ligand and t helper cell depletion are transient regimens that induce systemic until the development of newer strategies that selectively suppress adenoviral immune these are viable alternatives for enhancement of pancreatic adenoviral

activation of bovine lymphocyte subpopulations by staphylococcal enterotoxin staphylococcus aureus is a major mastitis-causing pathogen in the chronic nature of bovine staphylococcal mastitis suggests that some products or components of aureus may interfere with the development of protective one class of molecules that could be involved are superantigens although a significant number of mastitis isolates produce the effect of these molecules on the bovine immune system is to determine if immunosuppression caused by sags could play a role in we monitored bovine lymphocytes exposed to staphylococcal enterotoxin c1 activation of bovine lymphocytes by either sec1 or concanavalin a (cona) was influenced by the gammadelta/alphabeta t-cell ratio in the compared to cona-induced cultures stimulated with sec1 generated small numbers of cd4+ alphabeta t cells expressing high levels of interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (il-2r alpha) and major histocompatibility complex class ii suggesting that sag exposure does not lead to full activation of these this state of partial activation was most pronounced in cultures with a high gammadelta/alphabeta in significant numbers of cd8+ alphabeta t cells expressed high levels of il-2r alpha and regardless of the gammadelta/alphabeta ratio and the stimulant cd8+ blasts in cultures stimulated with sec1 also expressed another activation previously detected predominantly on thymocytes and cd4+ t although gammadelta cd2- and cd2+ t cells expressed mhcii and il-2r alpha following stimulation with only a few cells increased to blast suggesting that they were only partially the results suggest ways in which sags might facilitate immunosuppression that promotes the persistence of bacteria in cattle and contributes to chronic intramammary
epstein-barr biology and epstein-barr virus is a human herpes virus whilst found as a widespread asymptomatic is also associated with certain tumours of lymphoid and epithelial origin including lymphoma immunoblastic lymphoma disease (hd) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma a unique characteristic of ebv is its ability to infect and transform primary resting b lymphocytes in vitro into permanently growing lymphoblastoid cell lines this effect is associated with constitutive expression of a limited set of viral the pattern of ebv gene expression observed in lcls in vitro is also a feature of a tumour associated with the other ebv associated tumours display a more restricted pattern of ebv latent protein b cell lines can be activated in vitro into the virus replicative where a large number of viral genes associated with ebv dna replication and virus assembly are whilst ebv can be detected in throat washings from seropositive the only in vivo situation where full virus replication can be reliably observed in hairy leukoplakia a benign lesion of lingual epithelium frequently found in aids the relative contribution of lymphoid cells and epithelial cells to latent ebv infection/persistence vs replication in vivo remains recent studies suggest that hl represents a focus of ebv replication in the absence of a truly latent infection and this supports the contention that ebv persistence resides in the lymphoid these aspects together with the role of ebv in oral diseases and the effect of certain ebv genes on the control of epithelial cell growth and differentiation will be
and clinical outcome of hepatitis gb-c virus infection in liver transplant a novel rna virus of the flaviviridae family has been discovered recently and designated hepatitis gb-c virus previous studies have reported that gbv-c is associated with posttransfusion chronic viral and cryptogenic the clinical significance of gbv-c infection has been questioned increasingly in patients not undergoing to investigate whether gbv-c infection under immunosuppression affects the clinical or the histological outcome in liver transplant we determined the prevalence and incidence of gbv-c infections and the clinical and histological signs in patients after orthotopic liver transplantation the presence of gbv-c was tested in sera from patients before and in regular intervals up to 6 years after olt by nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using primers derived from the ns3 a total of 72 patients were before 8 of 72 patients were positive for after 7 of 8 remained of 64 patients who were negative for gbv-c before 23 became positive after resulting in a de novo rate of gbv-c infection of we could not detect a higher rate of histologically proven hepatitis in gbv-c-positive patients than in gbv-c-negative patients p > comparing gbv-c-positive with gbv-c-negative liver transplant we could not find any differences in liver function number of blood histological degree of or number of rejection survival was not negatively influenced by gbv-c in the presence of gbv-c did not influence the clinical or histological outcome in liver transplant
primary immunosuppression with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil for renal allograft studies using tacrolimus and corticosteroids or the combination of mycophenolate and corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection episodes in cadaveric kidney recipients compared with cyclosporine-based the current study is a retrospective analysis of our experience with tacrolimus combined with mycophenolate mofetil and steroids as primary immunosuppression for kidney transplant in a retrospective 72 patients who received primary therapy with mycophenolate and corticosteroids (triple therapy) were compared with a control group of 98 kidney recipients who received tacrolimus and corticosteroids (double there was a significant reduction in the incidence of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection in the triple therapy group compared with the double therapy group one-year patient and graft survival did not differ between the incidence of posttransplant diabetes mellitus was 18% and 21% in the triple and double therapy leukopenia and gastrointestinal side effects were the most common cause for discontinuation of mycophenolate the combination of tacrolimus with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids is more effective at preventing early acute rejection than tacrolimus and corticosteroids the use of mycophenolate mofetil was associated with a higher incidence of leukopenia and often leading to discontinuation of the
a novel and safe immunomodulating agent for restoring the depressed macrophage immune function after background and recent studies have shown that administration of the anterior pituitary after hemorrhage restored the depressed immune responses that are observed under those because metoclopramide (mcp) is known to increase prolactin secretion and ultimately plasma prolactin we attempted to determine whether administration of metoclopramide after hemorrhage produces any beneficial effects on the depressed splenocyte and peritoneal macrophage immune function after severe materials and mice were bled to and maintained at a mean arterial pressure of 35 mm hg for 60 then adequately resuscitated and segregated into two one group received saline animals in the other group were treated with metoclopramide (100 microg/100 g body subcutaneously) before two hours after saline or mcp the animals were killed and macrophage as well as splenocyte cultures plasma corticosterone levels were also the proliferative capacity of the splenocytes as well as their ability to release interleukin (il)-2 and il-3 in response to mitogen was markedly improved in animals that had hemorrhaged and that were treated with mcp compared with saline-injected the depressed splenic and peritoneal macrophage il-1 and il-6 release after hemorrhage was restored with mcp treatment with mcp prevented the increase in blood corticosterone levels seen after severe these results support the concept that the immunosuppression after hemorrhage may be mediated by hormones from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal mcp may be a useful adjuvant in the treatment of the trauma-hemorrhagic shock-induced

transforming growth factor beta and immunosuppression in experimental visceral hamsters infected with leishmania donovani develop a disease similar to human they present and their t cells do not respond to parasite this unresponsiveness has been primarily ascribed to defects in antigen-presenting cells because these cells are unable to stimulate proliferation of parasite-specific t cells from immunized in this we show that apcs (adherent spleen cells) from donovani-infected hamsters produce high levels of the inhibitory cytokine transforming growth factor beta immunohistochemical studies with an anti-tgf-beta monoclonal antibody (mab) showed that this cytokine is abundantly produced in vivo by the spleen cells of infected in high levels of tgf-beta are produced in vitro by infected hamster either spontaneously or after stimulation with parasite antigen or in vivo-infected adherent cells obtained from spleens of donovani-infected hamsters caused profound inhibition of the in vitro antigen-induced proliferative response of lymph node cells from hamsters immunized with leishmanial this inhibition was totally abrogated by the anti-tgf-beta these results suggest that the immunosuppression observed in visceral leishmaniasis at least in due to the abundant production of tgf-beta during the course of the

metabolism of synthetic corticosteroids by 11 beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenases in the presence of an 11 beta-hydroxyl group is essential for the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of interconversion of the 11 beta-hydroxyl into the corresponding 11 beta-keto group and vice versa by 11 beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase (11 beta-hsd) may thus play a pivotal role in the efficacy of these we have compared the metabolism of the endogenous glucocorticoid cortisol (f) with that of synthetic 9 alpha-fluorinated steroids by 11 beta-hsds in humans in vivo and in whereas 30% of the free steroids in urine after oral administration of 5 mg of f is f itself and 70% the inactive keto-product cortisone the urinary excretion of an identical dose of oral 9 alpha-fluorocortisol (9 alpha ff) is 90% 9 alpha ff and 10% inactive 9 alpha-fluorocortisone (9 alpha kidney slices similarly convert f much faster to e than 9 alpha ff to 9 alpha renal 11 beta-reduction of 9 alpha fe to 9 alpha ff is much more effective than that of e to kinetic analyses in human kidney cortex microsomes prove that the preference of fluorinated steroids for reduction in human kidney slices is catalyzed by 11 beta-hsd type the nadh-dependent conversion of 11-dehydro-dexamethasone another fluorinated to dexamethasone (d) is very effective (high high whereas reduction of e to f is very in human liver microsomes (11 beta-hsd type nonfluorinated (e) and fluorinated 11-dehydrosteroids (dh-d) are both reduced to their corresponding active 11-hydroxyderivatives but with a michaelis-menten constant about 20-fold higher than for kidney microsomes (11 our results suggest that the decreased renal 11 beta-oxidation of 9 alpha-fluorinated steroids may offer pharmacokinetic advantages for renal administration of fluorinated 11-dehydrosteroids is a new and exciting idea in glucocorticoid therapy in that small amounts of oral dh-d may pass the liver largely unmetabolized (11 beta-hsd-i has low affinity for such steroids) and may then be activated to d by high-affinity 11 thus allowing selective immunosuppression in organs expressing 11 beta-hsd-ii (kidney and
early cyclosporine monotherapy in liver a 5-year follow-up of a randomized maintenance of adequate immunosuppression and avoidance of side-effects are the goals of long-term management of all organ-transplanted we here report the final results of a randomized trial comparing early cyclosporine monotherapy versus double-drug therapy (cyclosporine and steroids) in adult liver transplantation one hundred four patients were randomized 3 months after transplantation either to continue (group i = 50 patients) or to stop steroids (group ii = 54 patients on a double-drug regimen were maintained long term on methylprednisolone at a dose of target cyclosporine trough levels were between 150 and 250 ng/ml in both our main points of interest were the prevalence of acute and chronic rejections and steroid-related side-effects in the two groups of mean follow-up was 41 +/- 16 months 4-68 patient actuarial survival 2 and 5 years after randomization was similar in the two groups (82% 83% and 82% the prevalence of acute rejections after randomization 8% and a single episode of chronic rejection was observed only in a patient on long-term steroid side-effects of steroid therapy were less frequent in patients weaned off and when considering hypertension and the differences between the two groups were statistically early cyclosporine monotherapy is a safe undertaking in liver transplantation because it allows a significant reduction of steroid-related side-effects without increasing the risk of acute and chronic after 5 patient survival was similar in patients with or without
decreased immunosuppressive effect of cortisol on natural killer cytotoxic activity in senile dementia of the alzheimer former studies have indicated alterations of the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (nk) cells in senile dementia of the alzheimer type these changes may be related to the increased reactivity of nk cells with even if an impairment of the immunosuppressive effect of glucocorticoids cannot be in the present study we have demonstrated a lower immunosuppressive effect of cortisol on nk cytolytic function in patients with sdat than in healthy elders and in patients with dementia of multi-infarct origin this suppression is completely lacking when cortisol is employed at low concentrations (10(-7) m) and is significantly reduced after incubation at physiological (10(-6) p < and supraphysiological concentrations (10(-5) p < the addition of il-2 (50 and 100 iu/ml/cells) significantly antagonizes the effects of cortisol in whereas the cortisol-dependent immunosuppression is partially maintained in healthy elders and in patients with our data indicate that the defect of the immunosuppressive effect of cortisol may play a role in nk dysregulation in contributing to the cytokine-mediated nk overactivity in this
alcohol decreases t-lymphocyte migration into lung tissue in response to pneumocystis carinii and depletes t-lymphocyte numbers in the spleens of previous work from our laboratory has shown that chronic alcohol consumption in mice creates immunosuppression sufficient to permit infection with the opportunistic pathogen pneumocystis host defense against carinii is critically dependent upon host t in these we address the effect of chronic alcohol consumption on recruitment of t lymphocytes into infected lung tissue and on lymphocytes in host lymphoid we find that mice administered alcohol in drinking water and then inoculated with carinii show significantly decreased recruitment of cd4+ and cd8+ t lymphocytes into lung tissue in comparison with control additional experiments show significant depletion of cd4+ lymphocytes in spleens from alcohol mice and decreased numbers of activated t analysis of surface expression of the adhesion molecules and icam-1 show no significant differences in lymphocytes from alcohol-consuming and lymphocyte chemotaxis in vitro is also we conclude that chronic consumption of alcohol impairs lung recruitment of lymphocytes in response to an infectious this impaired lymphocyte recruitment may be a consequence of depletion of t lymphocytes in host lymphoid impaired recruitment of lymphocytes may explain the increased morbidity and mortality of pulmonary infections in alcoholic
