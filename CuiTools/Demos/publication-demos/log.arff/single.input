regenerated dorsal root fibers form functional synapses in embryonic spinal cord the aim of the present study was to determine whether synapses formed by dorsal root afferents that regenerate into intraspinal transplants of fetal spinal cord are severed l4 or l5 dorsal root stumps were placed at the bottom of dorsal quadrant cavities made in the lumbar spinal cords of adult rats and juxtaposed to embryonic day 14 spinal cord in animals examined 5-10 weeks we recorded extracellularly in transplants from 43 units that fired in response to electrical stimulation of the implanted dorsal latency fluctuations of extracellular firing that increase with stimulus and failure to follow high-frequency and posttetanic potentiation of extracellular firing stimulation suggest that synapses with conventional properties are formed between regenerating afferents and transplant limited intracellular recordings confirmed the existence of excitatory postsynaptic potentials in transplant neurons after dorsal root in 16 extracellular firing occurred in response to single shock the remainder of the units required two or more dorsal root shocks to evoke some of these connections also may be under the assumption that single shock firing was most likely the result of monosynaptic connections between transplant neurons and regenerated dorsal root we estimated the conduction velocities of regenerated these estimates suggest that fibers with conduction velocities in the a and a alpha/beta ranges regenerate into transplants of embryonic spinal the results demonstrate that regenerated dorsal root axons establish functional synaptic connections with transplant the implications for using fetal transplants to help rebuild spinal reflex circuits after spinal cord injury are
identification of a mutation in the mp19 in the cataractous mouse mutant the gene encoding the second most abundant lens specific integral membrane has recently been proposed as an ideal candidate gene for the cataractous mouse the aim of this study was to screen the lim2 gene in the to3 mutant for a genetic lesion that was correlated and consistent with the mutant genomic dna was isolated from both normal mouse parental strains as well as the heterozygous and homozygous to3 cataract pcr was used to generate overlapping fragments of the entire lim2 gene from these the coding including splice junctions and the translational termination of these fragments were then a single g -> t transversion was identified within the first coding exon of the lim2 gene in the to3 mutant this dna change results in the nonconservative substitution of a valine for the normally encoded glycine at amino acid 15 of the mp19 the identified genetic lesion in the lim2 gene of the cataractous mouse confirms lim2 as an ideal candidate future transgenic experiments should provide proof or disproof of a causative relationship between the identified mutation and the cataractous these studies indicate that mp19 may play an important role in both normal lens development and and warrants more intense investigation of its role within the ocular
effective size and f-statistics of subdivided dioecious for a dioecious diploid population subdivided into an arbitrary number of we have derived recurrence equations for the inbreeding coefficient and coancestries between individuals within and among subpopulations and formulas for effective size and stable population size and discrete autosomal and the island migration model are and arbitrary distributions of the numbers of male and female progeny per different numbers and variable migration rates of males and females are incorporated in our some published equations for effective size and f-statistics for a subdivided population are shown to be incorrect because several incorrect probabilities are used in the a more general equation for effective size is obtained by finding eigenvalue solutions to the recurrence equations for inbreeding coefficient and coancestry in this which reduces to the simple and familiar expressions derived by previous authors for the special case of a single unsubdivided our general expressions for f-statistics also reduce to the classical results of infinite island model and its it is shown that population structure is important in determining effective size and f-statistics and should be recognized and incorporated into programs for genetic conservation and

the relationship of brevetoxin and a-ring functionality to binding and activity in neuronal sodium brevetoxins are polyether ladder toxins that are ichthyotoxic at nanomolar they bind to voltage-gated sodium causing four distinct electrophysiological (i) a shift of activation (ii) occurrence of subconductance (iii) induction of longer mean open times of the and (iv) inhibition of channel we set out to determine whether these functions all require the same structural elements within the brevetoxin several synthetically prepared structural analogs of brevetoxin b were examined in synaptosome receptor binding assays and by functional electrophysiological a truncated analog is not ichthyotoxic at micromolar shows decreased receptor-binding and causes only a shift of activation potential without affecting mean open times or channel an analog with the a-ring carbonyl removed binds to the receptor with nanomolar produces a shift of activation potential and inhibits but does not induce longer mean open an analog in which the a-ring diol is reduced shows low binding yet populates five subconductance our data are consistent with the hypothesis that binding to sodium channels requires an elongated cigar-shaped approximately 30 a the four electrophysiological effects of the brevetoxins are not produced by a single structural since they can be decoupled by using modified which are shown here to be partial sodium channel we propose a detailed model for the binding of brevetoxins to the channel which explains the differences in the effects of the brevetoxin these studies also offer the potential for developing brevetoxin

fine specificity of antigen binding to two class i major histocompatibility proteins (b*2705 and b*2703) differing in a single amino acid starting from the x-ray structure of a class i major histocompatibility complex (mhc)-encoded protein a naturally presented self-nonapeptide and two synthetic analogues were simulated in the binding groove of two human leukocyte antigen (hla) alleles (b*2703 and b*2705) differing in a single amino acid after 200 ps molecular dynamics simulations of the solvated hla-peptide some molecular properties of the complexes (distances between ligand and protein center of atomic buried versus accessible surface hydrogen-bond frequencies) allow a clear discrimination of potent from weak mhc the binding specificity of the three nonapeptides for the two hla alleles could be explained by the disruption of one hydrogen-bonding network in the binding pocket of the hla-b*2705 protein where the single mutation rearrangements of interactions in the b which binds the side chain of peptide residue and a weakening of interactions involving the c-terminal end of the peptide also took in extension of the peptide backbone using a beta-ala analogue did not abolish binding to any of the two hla-b27 but increased the selectivity for as expected from the larger peptide binding groove in this a better understanding of the atomic details involved in peptide selection by closely related hla alleles is of crucial importance for unraveling the molecular features linking particular hla alleles to autoimmune and for the identification of antigenic peptides triggering such

guglielmi detachable coil embolization for unruptured aneurysms in nonsurgical a cost-effectiveness we calculated the incremental cost-utility ratio for guglielmi detachable coil (gdc) embolization versus no therapy for unruptured intracranial aneurysms considered inappropriate for surgical clipping decision tree and markov analyses that employ cohort simulation were applied to determine the incremental cost-utility ratio of gdc embolization versus no therapy for unruptured cerebral clinical values required as input data were estimated from the literature for the following relative frequencies of complete aneurysmal partial aneurysmal and attempted coiling (no coils morbidity and mortality of gdc and mortality of spontaneous aneurysmal rupture in untreated and gdc-embolized annual rate of recanalization of gdc-embolized quality of life when knowingly living with untreated or gdg-embolized aneurysms and of living with fixed neurologic costs of gdc spontaneous aneurysmal and and discount cost-utility ratios below $50000 per quality-adjusted life year saved were considered sensitivity analyses were performed for all relevant input baseline input values resulted in acceptable cost-utility ratios for gdc embolization of unruptured intracranial these ratios remained within acceptable limits across wide ranges of various input cost-effectiveness was markedly affected by the natural course of untreated rates of spontaneous rupture greater than 2% per year resulted in favorable cost-utility ratios that were relatively unaffected by variation in gdc while rates of rupture less than 1% per year resulted in unfavorable ratios that were highly dependent on gdc many of the gdc efficacy such as rate of failed early and progressive aneurysmal have mild effects on the cost-utility gdc complication rate as well as life expectancy had moderate effects on the the influence of late aneurysmal recanalization was mild unless high rates of rupture for partially coiled aneurysms were suboptimal clip placement resulting from the presence of gdc coils within a ruptured aneurysm had no demonstrable consequence on cost-utility the single most influential variable determining the cost-effectiveness of gdc embolization in our analysis was the natural course of untreated other important variables included gdc-related morbidity and life expectancy at the time of gdc
an alternative method in the assessment of obstructive sleep apnea the conventional study of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (osas) requires two polysomnographic recordings on two different one for diagnosis and the other for determining an effective level of continuous positive airway pressure in this study we examined an alternative method requiring a single night of polysomnographic recording encompassing both diagnostic and treatment in order to obtain recordings of all phases of as well as recordings taken in supine decubitus the duration of polysomnographic readings was individualized to a single-night session was sufficient for diagnosis and for adjusting treatment in most in some cases the night was extended well into the morning hours in an effort to obtain all the necessary polysomnograms were compared to traditional ones by contrasting breathing parameters (the u of mann whitney) and sleep architecture findings for two groups of men diagnosed consecutively of thirty-four patients were studied over two nights (mean 50 bmi 37 forty-six patients (mean 49 38 kg/m2) were studied in single-night the differences between the two groups were not for most patients studied in to all sleep stages were recorded and readings were taken in supine rem sleep was not for 26% of the patients in this no significant differences between the double- and single-session groups were found for apnea (51 versus maximum oxygen desaturation (72% versus 75%) and effective cpap level (9 versus 10 cm these data suggest that both study methods are equally useful for evaluating osas severity and for prescribing effective cpap we the need to arrange for two-night studies in the minority of patients for whom no rem sleep recordings become available during a single
evidence for cyclophosphamide-induced gene conversion and mutation in mouse germ cyclophosphamide (cp) is a widely used antineoplastic it tests positive in several genotoxicity including those with endpoints such as chromosomal aberrations in mammalian mitotic recombination in drosophila and dominant lethal mutations in we have explored the effects of cp on genome stability of mouse (mus domesticus) spermatogenic using a recombination-based transgenic assay called in this intrachromosomal gene conversion events between two mutually defective lacz genes generates beta-galactosidase activity in the frequency of gene conversion events is determined by scoring spermatids stained with the lacz a dose-dependent induction of lacz-positive spermatids was observed following single intraperitoneal cp exposures of and 200 at 200 there was a 25-fold increase over treatment of a control transgenic line containing only a frame-shifted lacz transgene provided an indication that cp also induced reversion the timing of the response indicated that the induction of recombination and/or mutation occurred primarily in meiotic stage these results demonstrate potent germline mutagenicity of and validate the utility and sensitivity of genetic recombination as a rapid indicator of genotoxicity in whole
adeno-associated virus type 2-mediated gene correlation of tyrosine phosphorylation of the cellular single-stranded d sequence-binding protein with transgene expression in human cells in vitro and murine tissues in although the adeno-associated virus type 2 (aav)-based vector system has gained attention as a potentially useful alternative to the more commonly used retroviral and adenoviral vectors for human gene the single-stranded nature of the viral and consequently the rate-limiting second-strand viral dna significantly affect its transduction we have identified a cellular tyrosine designated the single-stranded d sequence-binding protein which interacts specifically with the d sequence at the end of the aav genome and may prevent viral second-strand dna synthesis in hela cells qing et usa in the present we examined whether the phosphorylation state of the ssd-bp correlates with the ability of aav to transduce various established and primary cells in vitro and murine tissues in the efficiencies of transduction of established human cells by a recombinant aav vector containing the beta-galactosidase reporter gene were 293 > kb > which did not correlate with the levels of aav the amounts of dephosphorylated ssd-bp which interacted with the minus-strand d probe were also as 293 > kb > predominantly the phosphorylated form of the ssd-bp was detected in cells of the k562 a human erythroleukemia cell and in cd34+ primary human hematopoietic progenitor the efficiencies of aav-mediated transgene expression were significantly lower in these murine sca-1+ lin- primary hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells contained predominantly the dephosphorylated form of the and these cells could be efficiently transduced by aav dephosphorylation of the ssd-bp also correlated with expression of the adenovirus e4orf6 known to induce aav gene a deletion mutation in the e4orf6 gene resulted in a failure to catalyze dephosphorylation of the extracts prepared from mouse and skeletal-muscle all of which are known to be highly permissive for aav-mediated transgene contained predominantly the dephosphorylated form of the the efficiency of transduction by aav vectors correlates well with the extent of the dephosphorylation state of the ssd-bp in vitro as well as in these data suggest that further studies on the cellular gene that encodes the ssd-bp may promote the successful use of aav vectors in human gene
frequency resolution and spectral integration (critical band analysis) in single units of the cat primary auditory frequency resolution and spectral filtering in the cat primary auditory cortex (ai) were mapped by extracellular recordings of tone responses in white noise of various single-tone excitatory tuning critical and critical ratios were determined as a function of neuronal characteristic frequency and tone single-tone excitatory tuning curves are inadequate measures of frequency resolution and spectral filtering in the because their shapes (in most neurons) deviated substantially from the shapes of curves for complex sound the curves determined by the band limits of the critical perceptual characteristics of spectral filtering (intensity independence and frequency dependence) were found in average critical bandwidths of neurons from the central and ventral the highest frequency resolution (smallest critical bandwidths) reached by neurons in the central and ventral ai equaled the psychophysical frequency the dorsal ai is since most neurons there had response properties incompatible with psychophysical features of frequency perceptual characteristics of critical ratios were not found in the average neuronal responses in any area of the it seems that spectral integration in the way proposed to be the basis for the perception of tones in noise is not present at the level of the
streptococcal and staphylococcal superantigen-induced lymphocytic arteritis in a local type experimental comparison with acute vasculitis in the arthus many pathogenic bacteria produce superantigenic to study their pathogenetic in particular to test whether these toxins are able to induce we developed a local-type experimental model in toxins were injected along the intermediate auricular artery of the the histology of ear including the was examined after single or repeated repeated injections of streptococcal erythrogenic toxins produced chronic-type arteritis characteristic of lymphocytic whereas single injection induced no acute-type staphylococcal enterotoxin b and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 also induced the same type of although weaker in in human patients these lesions are similar to those of kawasaki a systemic vasculitis with unknown the arthus reaction to human serum albumin in immunized rabbits included acute-type vasculitis similar to polyarteritis nodosa when examined in this microvasculitis lesions similar to leukoclastic vasculitis were combined in the arthus reaction but not in the superantigen-induced our experimental model described here is widely applicable to the study of the etiology and pathogenesis of human diseases involving vasculitis
exon-intron analysis of promoter and chromosomal localization of the human type 1 sigma receptor sigma receptor is a protein that interacts with a variety of psychotomimetic drugs including cocaine and amphetamines and is believed to play an important role in the cellular functions of various tissues associated with the and nervous here we report on the structure and organization of the human gene coding for this the gene is approximately 7 kbp long and contains four interrupted by three exon 3 is the shortest (93 and exon 4 is the longest among the intron 3 is the longest (approximately exon 2 codes for the single transmembrane domain present in the rapid amplification of cdna end reactions with mrna from the jar human trophoblast cell line have identified 56 bp upstream of the translation start codon as the initiation site for this transcription start site has been confirmed by rnase protection structural analysis of the flanking region has revealed that the gene is this contains a ccaatc box in the reverse complement and several gc boxes that are recognition sites for there are also consensus sequences for the liver-specific transcription factor nuclear for a variety of cytokine responsive and for the xenobiotic responsive factor called the arylhydrocarbon southern blot analysis of the genomic dna from chinese hamster-human and mouse-human hybrid cell lines and fluorescent in situ hybridization with human metaphase chromosome spreads have shown that the gene is located on human chromosome band a region known to be associated with different psychiatric
neurotrophin-3 prevents death of axotomized nucleus neurons in adult in the present we studied whether neurotrophin-3 (nt-3) contributes to the rescue of axotomized nucleus (cn) neurons in adult a significant (24%) loss of cn neurons occurred at l-1 ipsilateral to t-8 hemisection by 14 which reached 31% at 2 months and then axotomized cn neurons had also atrophied by 14 but mean cell size did not decrease animals that received gelfoam soaked in nerve growth brain derived neurotrophic or ciliary neurotrophic factor at the lesion site also showed a 30% neuron loss at 2 and a 40% reduction in average cell rats receiving nt-3 showed a 15% neuron which was not improved by additional neurotrophins in combination with none of the treatments prevented neuron bioassay of the gelfoam showed that nt-3 bioactivity remained at 5 days after surgery but not at 14 additional rats with hemisections that received nt-3 continuously via mini-pump for 2 months showed a 15% neuron the same as with nt-3 given via these results indicate that even limited exposure of axotomized cn neurons to nt-3 produces permanent rescue of 50% of the the virtually complete rescue that we had previously observed with transplants of fetal central nervous system (cns) tissues be due at least in part to but the exogenous administration of a single neurotrophic factor or a combination of neurotrophic factors is less effective than transplants in producing long-term survival of axotomized cns
streptavidin in antibody comparison of a recombinant streptavidin with two streptavidin mutant proteins and two commercially available streptavidin in this a comparison of wild type recombinant streptavidin (r-sav) with two genetically engineered mutant r-sav proteins was the investigation also included a comparison of the r-sav with two streptavidin (sav) proteins from commercial in vitro characterization of the sav proteins was conducted by and electrospray mass spectral all sav proteins studied appeared to be a single species by size exclusion chromatography (hplc) and sds-page but multiple species were noted in the ief and ms in vivo comparisons of the sav proteins were accomplished with dual isotope-labeled sav in athymic in an initial tissue localization of r-[131i]sav directly radiolabeled using chloramine-t was compared with r-sav radiolabeled with the n-hydroxysuccinimidyl p-iodobenzoate conjugate a radioiodination reagent that has been shown to result in iodine-labeled proteins which are stable to in vivo the data obtained indicated that there is little difference in the distribution (except kidney localization) when r-sav labeled by the two data obtained from comparison of r-[131i]sav with a disulfide-stabilized r-sav mutant a c-terminal cysteine-containing r-sav mutant and two 125i-labeled sav proteins obtained from commercial sources indicated that their distributions were quite except the kidney concentrations were generally lower than that of on the basis of the similar distributions of the sav proteins it appears that the r-sav mutants may be interchanged for the (wild type) r-sav in pretargeting the similarity of distributions with two commercially available sav proteins suggests that the results obtained in our studies and those of other groups may be directly compared (with consideration of animal sacrifice
ondansetron is not superior to moderate dose metoclopramide in the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting after minor gynaecological peri-operative nausea and vomiting remain a considerable ondansetron is being promoted currently as the drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of experiments to investigate efficacy of ondansetron in ponv have been made with placebo or single doses of other and often with different anaesthetic regimes with different emetic this study investigated the relative in the prevention of of ondansetron compared with metoclopramide used at a dose higher than used in previous ninety-six patients undergoing minor gynaecological surgery were randomized to receive either ondansetron 4 mg or metoclopramide mg the patients were then assessed in the recovery in the day ward prior to discharge and the following day for the occurrence of emetic symptoms occurred in similar proportions of patients who received ondansetron and nausea scores were similar between the groups in the recovery ward and 24-h follow-ups but there were higher post-operative nausea scores in the ondansetron group in the day ward (p = there were no significant side effects due to either we conclude that moderate dose metoclopramide is an effective alternative to ondansetron in the control of

out of what do genes tell genetic diversity patterns in nuclear versus mitochondrial systems and in low versus high mutation rate systems do not support the hypothesis of a recent african origin for all of humanity following a split between africans and non-africans years nor do genetic distance geographical analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial gene trees do not support the hypothesis of a recent global replacement of humans coming out of although a local replacement event in europe is indicated by these analyses and recent studies on neandertal the gene tree analyses instead indicate that genetic interchanges have ensured that all of humanity has evolved as a single evolutionary lineage with no major
the post-incision steps of the dna base excision repair pathway in escherichia studies with a closed circular dna substrate containing a single base the dna base excision repair pathway is responsible for removal of oxidative and endogenous dna base damage in both prokaryotes and this pathway involves formation of an apurinic/apyrimidinic (ap) site in the which is further processed to restore the integrity of the in escherichia coli it has been suggested that the major mode of repair involves replacement of a single nucleotide at the ap based on repair synthesis studies using oligonucleotide substrates containing a unique uracil the mechanism of the post-incision steps of the bacterial base excision repair pathway was examined using a dna plasmid substrate containing a single base repair synthesis carried out by repair-proficient recj and xon cell extracts was analyzed by restriction endonuclease cleavage of the dna containing the uracil it was found that replacement of the uracil base was always accompanied by replacement of several nucleotides ( approximately 15) of the uracil and this process was absolutely dependent on initial removal of the uracil base by the action of uracil-dna in contrast to findings with oligonucleotide replacement of just a single nucleotide at the lesion site was not these results suggest that repair patch length may be substrate dependent and a re-evaluation of the post-incision steps of base excision repair is
cloning and molecular characterization of a strawberry fruit ripening-related cdna corresponding a mrna for a low-molecular-weight heat-shock we have isolated and characterized a cdna from a strawberry fruit subtractive library that shows homology to class-i low-molecular-weight (lmw) heat-shock protein genes from other higher the strawberry cdna (clone njjs4) was a 779 bp full-length cdna with a single open reading frame of 468 bp that is expected to encode a protein of kda with a pi of southern analysis with genomic dna showed several high-molecular-weight hybridization indicating that the corresponding njjs4 gene is not present as a single copy in the this strawberry gene was not expressed in flowers and stolons but in fruits at specific stages of elongation and a differential pattern of mrna expression was detected in the fruit tissues achenes and the njjs4 gene expression increased in achenes accompanying the process of seed maturation whereas in the a high mrna expression was detected in the w2 during which most of the metabolic changes leading to the fruit ripening are our results clearly show a specific relationship of this njjs4 strawberry gene with the processes of seed maturation and fruit and strongly support that at least some of the class-i lmw heat-shock protein-like genes have a heat-stress-independent role in plant including fruit

effect of single mutations on the structural dynamics of a dna repair the escherichia coli formamidopyrimidine-dna glycosylase--a fluorescence study using tryptophan residues as reporter the effects on the structure dynamics of the escherichia coli wild-type formamidopyrimidine-dna glycosylase (fpg) protein of the single mutations lys57-->gly pro2-->gly (fpgp2g) and pro2-->glu (fpgp2e) were studied by fluorescence lifetime measurements and acrylamide quenching of the fluorescence of trp the fluorescence decays of fpg and its mutant forms were analysed by the maximum-entropy method and lifetime distributions in the range 200 ps to 9 ns were the lifetime distribution profiles of fpgp2g and fpgp2e are different from that of wild-type both dynamic and static quenching by acrylamide were observed for all the at 20 degrees the bimolecular collisional quenching rate constant of the fpgp2e fluorescence by acrylamide was only m(-1) s(-1) as compared to about m(-1) s(-1) for the three other at 6 degrees all the spectroscopic properties of these four proteins are about the the analysis of experimental data demonstrates that all three mutations induce a structural reorganization of the fpg only the p2e mutation lead to a reduced accessibility of some trp residues to acrylamide it is concluded that the single p2e replacement induces a conformational change leading to a more rigid globular structure as opposed to the wild type and k57g and p2g the influence of the single mutations on the enzyme activities of the fpg protein is
fine structure of the retinal epithelium (rpe) of the emu (dromaius as part of an ongoing comparative fine structural the retinal pigment epithelium choriocapillaris and complexus basalis membrane) in the emu (dromaius novaehollandiae) have been investigated by light and electron the rpe consists of a single layer of cuboidal cells joined basally by a series of tight basally (sclerally) the rpe cells display numerous deep infoldings while apically (vitreally) plentiful microvillar processes interdigitate with the photoreceptor outer internally the epithelial cells show a large vesicular plentiful smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ser) and numerous but very little rough endoplasmic reticulum numerous pleomorphic mitochondria are predominantly basally in the light-adapted specimens the melanosomes of the rpe are almost exclusively located within the apical processes of these phagosomes and lysosome-like bodies are also as are myeloid bodies which often display ribosomes on their outer membrane (complexus basalis) is typical of avian species in that it is pentalaminate and the central lamina densa is displaced towards the the choricocapillaris endothelium is attenuated but only minimally fenestrated facing most of these fenestrations show a single-layered diaphragm but fenestrations with a double-layered diaphragm are not
segregation analysis of cutaneous melanoma in to investigate whether the familial clustering of cutaneous melanoma is consistent with mendelian inheritance of a major autosomal maximum likelihood segregation analyses were performed in a population-based sample of families ascertained through a proband with melanoma diagnosed in queensland between 1982 and analyses were performed with the statistical using the regtl program for a binary trait with a variable age of we sought medical confirmation for all family members reported to have had and only medically verified cases among relatives were included in the the hypothesis of codominant mendelian inheritance gave a significantly better fit to the data than either dominant or recessive mendelian or environmental both mendelian inheritance of a single major and purely environmental transmission were rejected (p < in both the single major gene and environmental there was strong evidence of familial dependence in melanoma occurrence (p < these results are consistent with reported genetic heterogeneity in melanoma inheritance and suggest that other familial such as skin and sun exposure may play an important role in the familial clustering of

current surgical management of congenital diaphragmatic a report from the congenital diaphragmatic hernia study repair of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (cdh) has changed from an emergent procedure to a delayed procedure in the last many other aspects of management have also evolved since the first successful most reports are from single the lack of a large multicenter database has hampered progress in the management of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (cdh) and makes determination of the current standard the cdh study group was formed in 1995 to collect data from multiple institutions in north and participating centers completed a registry form on all live-born infants with cdh during 1995 and demographic data about surgical and outcome were collected for all sixty-two centers with 461 patients overall survival was 280 of 442 patients (63%) where survival was the defect was left-sided in right-sided in and bilateral in a subcostal approach was used in 91% of with pleural drainage used in a patch of some kind was used in just over half (51%) of the with polytetrafluoroethylene being the most commonly used material (81%) in those patients with a the mean surgical time was 102 with an average blood loss of 14 ml 0 to 500 the overwhelming majority of patients underwent repair between am and pm (289 of nineteen percent of patients had surgical repair on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) at a mean time of 170 hours into the ecmo course 10 to 593 the mean age at surgery in patients not treated with ecmo was 73 hours 1 to 445 the multicenter nature of this report makes it a snapshot of current the data would indicate that prosthetic patching of the defect has become that after-hours repair is and that delayed surgical repair has become the preferred approach in many the mean survival rate of 63% indicates that despite decades of individual the cdh problem is far from this highlights the need for a centralized database and cooperative multicenter studies in the
