catecholaminergic regulation of proliferation and survival in rat forebrain paraventricular germinal we have investigated the possible role of alpha1-adrenoreceptors in regulating the germination of progenitor cells cultured from embryonic rat high binding levels of the alpha1-selective radioligand 3[h]prazosin were detected in the forebrain of the rat embryo at and the greatest density of binding sites was localized to the ventricular and subventricular catecholamine-containing axon terminals were present in these zones in the same germinal neuroepithelial cells retained specific 3[h]prazosin binding in approximately 25% of cells in culture displayed complex intracellular ca2+ transients in response to many of which were abolished with the alpha1b cultures exhibited concentration-dependent catecholamine stimulation of dna synthesis mediated by alpha1 receptors in serum-limited neuroepithelial cells were labelled via their ventricular processes by intraventricular injection of fast blue in e13 embryos prior to transfer of the neocortex to dissociated cell many of labelled cells were present in culture in germinal some cells which migrated from these foci underwent as determined by tunel in situ during a transitory period of up to 48 h in alpha1-adrenoreceptor activation by phenylephrine or noradrenaline increased the number of surviving apoptosis was observed in vivo in both ventricular and subventricular zones of the neocortex from e13 to e15 in increasing we propose that both the supply of noradrenaline to forebrain germinal and the expression of alpha1-adrenoreceptors on their surface could act to determine whether they die or continue to
spatiotemporal patterns of gamma frequency oscillations tetanically induced in the rat hippocampal we used transverse and longitudinal rat hippocampal slices to study the synchronization of gamma frequency (> 20 hz) across distances of up to gamma oscillations were evoked in the ca1 region by tetanic stimulation at one or two sites and were associated with population tetanic stimuli that were strong enough to induce oscillations were associated with depolarization of both pyramidal cells and largely produced by activation of metabotropic glutamate computer simulations of gamma oscillations were also performed in a model with pyramidal cells and arranged in a chain of five cell this model had suggested previously that interneurone networks alone could generate synchronous gamma oscillations but that pyramidal cell by inducing spike doublets in was necessary for the occurrence of highly correlated oscillations with small phase lag (< in a distributed network possessing long axon conduction in both experiment and pyramidal cell spikes occurred in phase with local population as did the first spike of the interneurone the conductance of the interneurone alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (ampa) receptor-mediated conductance was manipulated in the while the relation between oscillations at opposite ends of the chain was when the conductance was large enough for doublet firing to be synaptically induced in oscillation phase lags were < ms across the as experimental blockade of ampa receptors resulted in increased phase lags between two sites oscillating compared with control both in model and in when stimuli to the two ends of the network were slightly cross-network synchronization occurred with a shorter phase lag at high frequencies than at lower these data suggest while interneurone networks alone can generate locally synchronized gamma firing of pyramidal and the synaptically induced doublet firing in contribute to the stability and tight synchrony of the oscillations in distributed

multiaxial myocardial mechanics and extracellular matrix mechanochemical regulation of cardiac fibroblast substantial evidence suggests that not only does the structure of the cardiac extracellular matrix affect the mechanical properties of but that mechanical loading affects the synthesis of the extracellular loading conditions in vivo are nonhomogeneous and an experimental approach that combines mechanics and cell biology is used to examine the mechanisms of extracellular matrix remodeling in the the results indicate that differential biological responses in adult cardiac fibroblasts can be correlated with specific physical such as the magnitude and two dimensional (2d) pattern of some effects of flow-function relations are
liquid crystalline ordering of nucleosome core particles under macromolecular crowding evidence for a discotic columnar hexagonal macromolecular crowding conditions occurring inside the cell nucleus were reproduced experimentally with solutions of mononucleosome core particles to study their supramolecular we report here that under these and over a large range of monovalent salt mononucleosome core particles self-assemble to form a discotic liquid crystalline phase characterized in polarizing and freeze-fracture electron mononucleosomes are stacked on each other to form which are themselves closely packed into an hexagonal the nucleosome estimated from the network falls in the range of values measured in cell we suggest that these concentrated although their organization cannot be immediately compared to the organization of chromatin in may be used to investigate the nucleosome-nucleosome this approach may be complexified to take into account the complexity of the eucaryotic
auditory selective an fmri in the present 25 adult subjects discriminated speech tokens ([ba]/[da]) or made pitch judgments on tone stimuli (rising/falling) under both binaural and dichotic listening we observed that when listeners performed tasks under the dichotic during which greater demands are made on auditory selective activation within the posterior (parietal) attention system and at primary processing sites in the superior temporal and inferior frontal regions was the cingulate gyrus within the anterior attention system was not influenced by this hemispheric differences between speech and nonspeech tasks were also both at area within the inferior frontal gyrus and in the middle temporal
transcriptional control of several aerobically induced cytochrome structural genes in rhodobacter to decipher how the synthesis of energy-transducing enzymes responds to environmental the response of three rhodobacter sphaeroides aerobic cytochrome gene promoters was analysed under different two of these promoters are upstream of structural genes (ctad and coxii) for individual subunits of the cytochrome aa3 respiratory the third promoter is that for the cycfg which encodes two c-type cytochromes of unknown cytochrome c554 and primer extension analysis identified a single oxygen-responsive transcription start site for each utilizing operon fusions to escherichia coli lacz as a measure of promoter transcription from the coxii and cycfg promoters was approximately twofold higher when cells were grown at high (30%) oxygen tensions than under low (2%) oxygen or anaerobic (photosynthetic) analysis of promoter function using specific host mutations indicated that loss of the sphaeroides fnr causes a but increase in cycfg and coxii transcription when cells are grown at 2% neither the delta fnrl mutation nor alterations in sequences related to a consensus target site for the coli fnr protein increased function of any of these three promoters to that seen under aerobic conditions in wild-type from this we conclude that fnrl is not solely responsible for reduced transcription of these three aerobic cytochrome genes under low oxygen or anaerobic when activity of these three promoters was monitored after cells were shifted from anaerobic (photosynthetic) conditions to a 30% oxygen it took several cell doublings for lacz levels to increase to those found in steady-state 30% oxygen from these it appears that activity of these promoters is also regulated by a stable molecule whose synthesis or function responds slowly to the presence of high oxygen
no increase in during addition of lamotrigine treatment in it has been suggested that lamotrigine (ltg) may enhance the toxicity of carbamazepine (cbz) by increasing the concentration of the active metabolite (cbz-e) in adult the authors investigated this hypothesis in an add-on study in 11 children and 3 aged 6-22 who had been treated for more than 1 year with cbz in monotherapy or with cbz in combination with one or two other antiepileptic the ltg dosage was increased step by step until clinical response or side effects were the plasma concentrations of and cbz-e were monitored during steady state conditions before and after the addition of it was found that ltg had no effect on mean cbz concentrations and that it decreased rather than increased the mean plasma concentration of cbz-e from +/- to +/- mumol/l (mean +/- n = p = observed side effects were diplopia in two agitation in and increased number of seizures in none of these five patients had unusually high cbz-e levels when the side effect it is concluded that addition of lamotrigine in children treated with carbamazepine children does not result in a pharmacokinetic interaction with a toxic accumulation of

metabolic effects and cellular volume responses induced by noradrenaline in nucleated the mechanism of adrenergic camp accumulation and associated na+ and k+ concentration changes was investigated in amphibian rana ridibunda the addition of noradrenaline to an isotonic suspension of red cells of frog rana ridibunda in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutyryl-methylxanthine induced a significant increase of the cell forskolin treatment showed analogous the removal of the na+ from the incubation inhibited the volume changes caused by either noradrenaline or under the same conditions a more than two-fold increase of lactate 260% increase of glucose consumption and accumulation of camp were these effects are specific and the peak of lactate production at min was followed by a slow further whereas camp reached a plateau after 15 the increased glycolytic rate is probably the consequence of an activation of phosphofructokinase by when the red cells were incubated in the presence of either noradrenaline or the camp dibutyryl-camp the intracellular concentration of na+ was significantly increased by the first min of incubation compared with the initial both the adrenergic activation and dibutyryl-camp treatment induced an intracellular decrease in the k+ content by in the presence of amiloride the na+ and the k+ content of erythrocytes remained cellular swelling may be a prerequisitive for activation of na+ and k+ these findings suggest a regulatory role of camp in the energy metabolism of rana ridibunda in the adrenergic responses were rapid and specific to alpha 1 and
vascular endothelial growth placenta growth factor and their receptors in isolated human the expression of the angiogenic growth vascular endothelial cell growth factor (vegf) and placenta growth factor (pigf) was demonstrated in isolated human term cytotrophoblast and in vitro differentiated rnase protection assays demonstrated vegf expression in both cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast while prominent pigf expression was detected in both types of trophoblast by northern blot vegf expression increased approximately eightfold in trophoblast cultured under hypoxic conditions (1 per cent o2) yet pigf expression decreased 73 +/- per cent in the same these results suggest distinct regulatory mechanisms govern expression of vegf and pigf in characterization of the vegf/pigf kdr and revealed the presence of flt-1 mrna in isolated cytotrophoblast and in vitro differentiated kdr was not detected in the isolated exogenous rhvegf induced c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) activity in the normal trophoblast indicating that the flt-1 receptors on trophoblast are trophoblast-derived vegf/pigf could act in a paracrine fashion to promote uterine angiogenesis and vascular permeability within the placental in presence of function flt-1 on normal trophoblast suggests that vegf/pigf functions in an autocrine manner to perform an as yet undefined role in trophoblast and/or metabolic activity during
determination of airway and tissue resistances after antigen and methacholine in nonhuman antigen challenge of ascaris suum-sensitive animals has been used as a model of asthma in no reports have separated total respiratory resistance into airway (raw) and tissue (rti) we compared input impedance (zin) and transfer impedance (ztr) to determine raw and rti in anesthetized cynomolgus monkeys under control and bronchoconstricted zin data between 1 and 64 hz are frequency dependent during baseline and this frequency dependence shifts in response to suum or thus it cannot be modeled with the dubois and estimates of raw and rti cannot be with baseline data were much less variable than zin in all after bronchial challenge with suum or the absolute amplitude of the resistive component of ztr increased and its zero crossing shifted to higher these data can estimate raw and rti with the six-element dubois in ztr has advantages over other measures of lung since it provides a methodology to separate estimates of raw and in ztr shows spectral features similar to those reported in healthy and asthmatic
role of endothelial dysfunction in coronary artery disease and implications for atherosclerosis is a complex process that is characterized by the accumulation of modified low-density lipoprotein local inflammatory and immune and reduced nitric oxide bioavailability within the arterial these cellular changes lead to endothelial vasomotor plaque and the development of clinical events such as stable angina and the acute coronary the vascular endothelium plays a critical role in modulating both the inflammatory response and vasomotor abnormalities that occur in those with coronary artery disease or risk factors for in these endothelial cells are activated by cytokines to express cellular adhesion molecules that facilitate the adhesion of leukocytes to the and their migration into the subintimal cytokines stimulate inflammatory and smooth muscle cells in the intima to produce degradative including metalloproteinases that can weaken the fibrous cap of atherosclerotic lesions and make them vulnerable to endothelial cells also regulate vascular tone by the synthesis of nitric atherosclerosis and other conventional risk factors for coronary artery disease are associated with endothelial vasodilator dysfunction in the coronary epicardial and resistance which likely contributes to myocardial several studies have demonstrated that lowering serum total and ldl cholesterol reverses endothelial vasomotor reduces myocardial and lowers the risk of the acute coronary syndromes or need for improving endothelial for by lowering blood cholesterol should now be regarded as a goal of therapy in the treatment of coronary artery
role of the na+/k+-atpase in regulating the membrane potential in rat peritoneal mast the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the na+/k+-atpase on the membrane potential of peritoneal mast cells isolated from male sprague-dawley experiments were performed at 22-26 degrees c in the tight-seal whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique by use of sylgard-coated patch pipettes (3-6 high-resolution membrane currents were recorded with an epc-9 patch-clamp amplifier controlled by the in a charting programme on another computer synchronously recorded at low resolution (2 hz) membrane potential and holding current (low-pass filtered at 500 na+/k+-atpase activity was measured as the ouabain-sensitive change in the zero-current the zero-current potential in rat peritoneal mast cells measured 2 min after obtaining whole-cell configuration amounted to +/- mv (n = ouabain (5 a had only a very minor effect upon the membrane potential under resting conditions (n = when mast cells were superfused with nominal calcium-free external the cells hyperpolarized (delta +/- mv (n = in when the mast cells were preincubated in nominal calcium-free external solution for 12 +/- min before whole-cell the membrane potential amounted to +/- mv (n = a subsequent superfusion with ouabain (5 mm) depolarized the membrane potential (ouabain-sensitive hyperpolarization (delta +/- mv (n = a high intracellular concentration of na+ ([na+]i) mm) also resulted in hyperpolarization (delta +/- mv (n = but only when atp was a subsequent superfusion with ouabain (5 mm) repolarized these cells to +/- 14 mv (ouabain-sensitive hyperpolarization (delta +/- mv (n = the size of the [na+]i-dependent hyperpolarization was low [na+]i (1 mm) had no effect on membrane potential and these cells were unaffected by superfusion with calcium-free external these data thus directly confirm that the stimulant effect of calcium-free external solutions on the ouabain-sensitive changes in the zero-current and hence the is mediated through [na+]i and that the activity of the na+/k+-atpase can have an important influence on the resting membrane potential in rat peritoneal mast
the cellular basis of tumor variability in disease presentation and course is a hallmark of variability is seen among similarly diagnosed cancers in different patients or animal hosts and in the same cancer at different periods of this latter type of termed was defined by foulds in a series of six rules that describe the independent behavior of individual cancers and the independent evolution of different cancer tumor progression is believed to result from variability among subpopulations of tumor cells within individual cancers and from selection of these subpopulations by conditions within the cancer such that different subpopulations come to prominence over the course of cancer development and interactions among modulate tumor behavior as well as tumor the leading hypothesis for the origin of tumor subpopulations is the genetic instability of cancer there are a number of possible mechanisms of genetic some internal to cancer cells mutator dna repair deficiencies) and some present in the tumor microenvironment (endogenous there are also potential epigenetic mechanisms of including alterations in gene and cell regardless of the heterogeneity of tumor subpopulations poses a number of challenges to the practice of cancer including the design of reproducible and meaningful tumor heterogeneity also has significant consequences for the clinical assessment of tumor prognosis and the development of effective treatment
control of repetitive lip and finger movements in influence of external timing signals and simultaneous execution on motor this study addresses the question of whether external timing signals and/or simultaneous rhythmic movements of other limbs can alleviate sequencing motor deficits associated with disease subjects performed rhythmic lip and finger movements simultaneously or in in they had to self-pace their movements or match them to an external our results are summarized as (1) seven of 12 patients had adequate mean repetition that they fulfilled the task requirements on a global the remaining five patients had various degrees of hastened responses and were not fully able to synchronize their movements to an external pacing (b) pd patients exhibited hypometria in their finger but not in their lip their movements were not abnormally but peak velocity was appropriately even to reduced movement (c) mean repetition stability of frequency and kinematics did not differ between conditions of external and internal stimulation within the pd but were different form the control group (d) kinematic measures were not improved during dual-task pd patients were not able to maintain a rhythm between the incidence of hastening increased during simultaneous motor we conclude that the use of external pacing signals might aid movement initiation of pd but does not improve their temporal or spatial coordination when generating repetitive simultaneous execution does not necessarily enhance motor but might actually have detrimental effects in patients prone to

inhibition of protein synthesis by reduced k+ in cultured endothelial total protein synthesis (as precipitable [3h] leucine incorporation) was determined under various experimental conditions to examine the relationship between cellular k+ and protein synthesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells we found that under normal external k+ concentration (5 total protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide and with estimated values of ic50 of microm and cellular k+ concentrations were determined (102 +/- 4 mm for control cells) and found to be significantly increased (p < by high external k+ (25 mm) and significantly decreased (p < by low external k+ mm) as well as by ouabain (2 under high external total protein synthesis and the inhibitory responses of cycloheximide and ouabain were not on the cellular k+ and protein synthesis were both further reduced by about half (p < under low external while ouabain further reduced cellular k+ by half (p < protein synthesis was only slightly reduced (p < under low external k+ and thus the relative reduction on protein synthesis was much less than that for cellular these results indicate that while elevated intracellular k+ did not alter protein reduced intracellular k+ correlated with a reduced cellular protein synthesis in huvec such that k+ may play a permissible role in the regulation of protein
nucleosome structural transition during chromatin unfolding is caused by conformational changes in nucleosomal we have recently reported that certain core histone-dna contacts are altered in nucleosomes during chromatin unfolding gavin and (1996) in this we demonstrate that these alterations are caused by a conformational change in the nucleosomal using zero-length protein-dna we have mapped histone-dna contacts in isolated core particles at ionic conditions affecting dna which may change the nucleosomal dna we found that the alterations in histone-dna contacts induced by an increase in dna stiffness in isolated core particles are identical to those observed in nucleosomes during chromatin the change in the pattern of micrococcal nuclease digestion of linker histone-depleted chromatin at ionic conditions affecting chromatin compaction also suggests that the stretching of the linker dna may alter the nucleosomal dna resulting in a structural transition in the nucleosome which may play a role in rendering the nucleosome competent for transcription and/or
stress response in a leporine renal cell it is well established that renal proximal tubule (rpt) cells grown under standard in vitro conditions attenuate many of their in vivo properties and the study of renal stress response mechanisms requires an appropriate cell culture in the present we compared the heat stress (10 45 degrees c) response of freshly isolated rpt cells with that of rpt cells grown in vitro for 6 days under two different culture (1) shake where oxygen levels and physiological functions are maintained via continuous media motion [nowak schnellmann am j physiol and (2) still involving standard cell culture which leads to partial hypoxia and a marked reduction in physiological the freshly isolated rpt cells progressively synthesized heat shock proteins (hsps) and stress glycoproteins (sgs) during a 3-hour culture period in under these heat stress did not further increase hsp and sg in rpt cells grown under shake hsp70 synthesis was detected 1 h after heat stress and decreased below detection by 3 in the uptake of radiolabeled mannose into (glycoprotein) gp62 (mr and gp38 was observed in control shake cultures and was not further increased after heat these results are consistent with immunohistochemistry where similar changes in hsp70 and gp50 expression were rpt cells grown under still conditions showed both increased synthesis of hsp70 and increased glycosylation of and gp38 as early as 1 h after heat but in contrast to shake this heat-induced stress response further intensified at 3 h after heat by 7 h after hsp synthesis returned to control while glycosylation of gp62 and gp50 remained based on our we conclude that freshly isolated rpt cells exhibit a stress response that may be caused by acute cell isolation/culture while this stress response freshly isolated rpt cells appear unable to respond to additional heat rpt cells grown under shake and still conditions exhibit high rates of sg especially that of possibly reflecting a condition associated with growth on plastic rpt cells from still cultures show a higher capacity for responding to acute heat stress than shake evidenced by the transiently increased hsp synthetic the interpretation of the renal stress response must be linked to a specific culture
hla-c heavy chains free of distribution in normal tissues and neoplastic lesions of non-lymphoid origin and interferon-gamma lacking monospecific antibodies to the expression and synthesis of these molecules have been difficult to using biochemical and flow cytometry the present report demonstrates that the reactivity of the murine monoclonal antibody l31 is restricted to naturally occurring hla-c (hla-cw1 through hla-b8 and hla-b51 heavy chains not associated with beta2-microglobin this is due to two properties of hla-c heavy (a) they share the l31 epitope which distinguishes them from all the hla-a and most hla-b (b) they accumulate in a beta2m-free in much greater amounts than most l31-reacting hla-b heavy on the basis of this restricted a representative panel of normal and neoplastic human tissues and cells derived from hla-b8- b51- individuals was selected and employed to assess the tissue surface expression and ifn-gamma responsiveness of beta2m-free hla-c heavy at variance from antibody w6/32 to beta2m-associated heavy l31 stains normal and neoplastic tissues with a ground-glass pattern and weakly binds to the surface of viable even after treatment with interferon gamma beta2m-free hla-c heavy chains for the most located in spite of their distinct cellular l31- and w6/32-reacting molecules have an overlapping tissue undergo concordant changes upon transformation and are upregulated in their synthesis by ifn-gamma to a similar these observations demonstrate a coordinate regulation of hla-c with hla-a and -b in they indicate that the assembly of hla-c is impaired in most body districts and ifn-gamma is unable to completely reverse this the present results are consistent with a low surface expression of hla-c and with a privileged role of these molecules in signaling class i loss to cytotoxic effectors in pathological
hemiretinal contribution to the timing of the full-field pvep as determined with the motor reaction with the use of the simple motor reaction time we examined the contribution of the hemiretinas to the timing of the pattern reversal visual evoked potential rts were obtained to the reversal of a progressively dimmer check falling either on the superior or inferior results were correlated with the peak time of the p1 wave evoked to the reversal of the entire checkerboard stimulus to the same luminance conditions as that used to generate the rt our results clearly indicate that the time taken to trigger a manual response depends not only on the luminance of the but also on where it falls on the comparing the above data with the peak time of the pvep obtained to the reversal of the entire screen indicates that at brighter luminance the peak time of the p1 wave correlates with that measured from the most central while at dimmer intensities it correlates with the mathematical average of all the retinal locations
evaluation of methods for isolation of dna from slowly and rapidly growing mycobacteria generally have thick cell walls and contain large amounts of making them resistant to dna five extensive enzymic digestion method 2-min mechanical glass-bead disruption method thermal shock method modified conventional enzymic digestion method and manual disruption with modified conventional enzymic digestion method were used to compare their effectiveness and simplicity in extracting dna from slowly growing mycobacteria (mycobacterium lepraemurium and bovis and a rapidly growing mycobacterium the highest dna yield was obtained by m2 from lepraemurium which produced micrograms dna/mg wet weight of representing a theoretical yield of m3 gave the lowest dna microgram dna/mg wet weight of cells of lepraemurium was in which proteinase k was is more effective than in which subtilisin and pronase were m5 yielded a higher amount of but it required more manipulations to extract dna as compared to extraction of dna of leprae from nude mice is more difficult than that of leprae from armadillos by all of the methods these results suggest that the biosynthetic capabilities of these two forms of leprae may depending on their cultural conditions and/or strain our results have shown that both m2 and m4 are the most effective and time-saving methods which are suitable for every routine laboratory to extract dna from slowly and rapidly growing
dehalogenation and biodegradation of brominated phenols and benzoic acids under and methanogenic the anaerobic biodegradation of monobrominated phenols and benzoic acids by microorganisms enriched from marine and estuarine sediments was determined in the presence of different electron acceptors or under all conditions the bromophenol isomers were utilized without a lengthy lag period whereas the bromobenzoate isomers were utilized only after a lag period of 23 to 64 2-bromophenol was debrominated to with the subsequent utilization of phenol under all three reducing debromination of 3-bromophenol and 4-bromophenol was also observed under sulfidogenic and methanogenic conditions but not under iron-reducing in the bromobenzoate-degrading no intermediates were observed under any of the conditions debromination rates were higher under methanogenic conditions than under sulfate-reducing or iron-reducing the stoichiometric reduction of sulfate or fe(iii) and the utilization of bromophenols and phenol indicated that biodegradation was coupled to sulfate or iron the production of phenol as a transient intermediate demonstrates that reductive dehalogenation is the initial step in the biodegradation of bromophenols under iron- and sulfate-reducing
a method for assaying intestinal brush-border sucrase in an intact intestinal small intestinal brush-border hydrolases usually are assayed in intestinal mucosal homogenates resuspended in solutions of unphysiological ionic extrapolation of measured vmax values (maximal reaction rates at high substrate concentrations) to in vivo hence comparison with physiological substrate is we therefore have developed a sucrase assay in an intact preparation of mouse small an everted intestinal sleeve incubated in a physiological as in homogenate sucrase is assayed by glucose production measured but uptake of liberated glucose into the intestinal sleeve is prevented by the transport inhibitor the coefficient of variation of vmax is 16% for sleeves from the same mouse and 8% for mean values from different sleeve sucrase activity is abolished by the inhibitor activity in sleeves and homogenates proves to be the same when measured under identical solution but variations in assay conditions cause large activity changes from values measured in physiological
differential regulation by estrogens of growth and prolactin synthesis in pituitary cells suggests that only a small pool of estrogen receptors is required for pr1 cells are a prolactin (prl)-secreting cell line derived from a pituitary lactotroph tumor found in 17beta-estradiol-treated fischer 344 we examined the effect of estrogen on cell proliferation and prl synthesis under various culture at extremely low induces cell proliferation in this cell whereas antiestrogen inhibits the proliferation response is much more sensitive than the prl response because pm estradiol or diethylstilbestrol induces half-maximal growth induction [ approximately estrogen receptor (er) occupancy is whereas nm concentration is required for half-maximal prl induction ( approximately 50% er occupancy is the proliferation response is not as sensitive to antiestrogen as the prl because 10 nm concentration of the pure antiestrogen ici could not inhibit 1 nm estradiol- or diethylstilbestrol-induced the same concentration of ici decreased prl secretion to 1% of estradiol- or diethylstilbestrol-induced prolactin secretion suggesting a possible dichotomy of er control of proliferation and prl the kd of er binding in these cells is about 3 x 10(-11) these results with the pr1 cells extend previous studies in other estrogen- regulated systems and suggest that only a small pool of er is required for cell proliferation in contrast with the regulation of expression of specific they also raise questions as to how a dimeric receptor functions when only one ligand site is occupied or when both an estrogen and an antiestrogen occupy one
a chloride-inducible acid resistance mechanism in lactococcus lactis and its a promoter was identified in lactococcus lactis that is specifically induced by we describe the nucleotide sequence and functional analysis of two genes transcribed from this gadc and gadc is homologous to putative glutamate-gamma-aminobutyrate antiporters of escherichia coli and shigella flexneri and contains 12 putative membrane-spanning gadb shows similarity to glutamate a lactis gadb mutant and a strain that is unable to express both gadb and gadc was more sensitive to low ph than the wild type when nacl and glutamate were expression of gadcb in lactis in the presence of chloride was increased when the culture ph was allowed to decrease to low levels by omitting buffer from the while glutamate also stimulated gadcb these genes encode a glutamate-dependent acid resistance mechanism of lactis that is optimally active under conditions in which it is needed to maintain immediately upstream of the chloride-dependent gadcb promoter a third gene encodes a protein (gadr) that is homologous to the activator rgg from streptococcus gadr expression is chloride and glutamate a gadr mutant did not produce the 3kb gadcb mrna that is found in wild-type cells in the presence of indicating that gadr is an activator of the gadcb
development and validation of tmj viscoelasticity we developed a tmj viscoelasticity analyzer for non-invasive evaluation of the soft tissues of the tmj we used this device to measure the viscoelastic viscosity elasticity (k) and mass of the tmj region for two experiments were performed to determine the optimum measurement conditions for the preload head posture and clenching we determined measurement variability and carried out statistical analysis by analysis of variance we found that the values for c and k varied significantly depending on preload magnitudes (p < in all parameters varied significantly depending on head clenching level did not significantly affect any of the measurement variability was below 10% for all examination of viscoelasticity of the tmj region provides valuable information about functional and pathological changes in the soft tissues of this in this we were able to determine the fundamental characteristics of the tmj viscoelasticity analyzer and develop methods for examining patients with temporomandibular
preferred interaction of d-peptidyl-anthraquinones with double-stranded the quest for more specific drugs in antitumor chemotherapy led us to the design of anthraquinone-peptide conjugates capable of selective recognition of the nucleic we present here the dna binding sequence specificity and geometry of interaction of a pair of enantiomers containing the lysine-glycine dipeptide in the side the d enantiomer binds right handed double stranded dna more efficiently than the l form under all conditions the source of higher binding affinity is not electrostatic in nature and rests in the more favorable hydrophobic contacts of the d-lysyl side chains in the drug-dna both derivatives exhibit preference for alternating gc base sequences and intercalate into dna in a threading mode as suggested by chiroptical and theoretical the d being a peptidyl derivative that contains a non-natural amino has the considerable advantage of being less susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis and could therefore represent a lead compound for further
[treatment of hemorrhagic congestive gastropathy with tips pilot minimally invasive percutaneous procedures has an important place in internal in this concept is included a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts in this pilot study we describe the indication of this therapeutic modality in three cirrhotic patients with hemorrhagic congestive gastropathy unresponsive to infusion of drugs that reduce the portal all of them were treated by tips and control of gastric bleeding occurred in one of these showed partial stenosis of the treated by prosthesis another developed portosystemic encephalopathy controlled by usual therapeutic measures in the other we implanted two tips to obtain a low pressure level of the hepatic-portal they had no further necessity of blood with better hemodynamic conditions and biochemical tests with reduction of the values of the we conclude that tips may be useful to treat hemorrhagic congestive gastropathy acting like a bridge for subsequent elective liver transplantation under good clinical and hemodynamic
bicarbonate therapy and intracellular the correction of metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate remains experiments in vitro have suggested possible deleterious effects after alkalinization of the extracellular disequilibrium of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate across cell membranes after alkali leading to the phenomenon of intracellular has been held responsible for some of these adverse changes in intracellular ph in suspensions of leucocytes from healthy volunteers were monitored using a fluorescent intracellular the effect in vitro of increasing extracellular ph with sodium bicarbonate was studied at different sodium bicarbonate lactic acid and propionic acid were added to the extracellular buffer to mimic conditions of metabolic the addition of a large bolus of sodium bicarbonate caused intracellular acidification as has been observed the extent of the intracellular acidosis was dependent on several being most evident at higher starting intracellular when sodium bicarbonate was added as a series of small boluses the reduction in intracellular ph was under conditions of initial acidosis this was rapidly followed by intracellular although intracellular acidification occurs after addition of sodium bicarbonate to a suspension of human leucocytes in the effect is minimal when the conditions approximate those seen in clinical we suggest that the observed small and transient lowering of intracellular ph is insufficient grounds in itself to abandon the use of sodium bicarbonate in human
ncs-mpp a high affinity and irreversible 5-ht1a receptor a novel irreversible 5-ht1a receptor binding ncs-mpp based on the new 5-ht1a receptor antagonist p-mppi -piperazine was and its binding characteristics were evaluated using in vitro homogenate binding with rat hippocampal the ki value of ncs-mpp was estimated to be +_ nm using analysis of concentration-dependent inhibition for the binding of [125i]p-mppi to 5-ht1a novascreen of ncs-mpp showed low to moderate binding affinities to alpha-2-adrenergic and 5-ht2 with ki values of and 103 these data strongly suggest that the ligand bound to 5-ht1a receptors with high affinity and high irreversible inhibition of [125i]p-mppi binding by ncs-mpp following a 5 min incubation at room temperature was concentration the inhibition increased to 50% at a concentration less than 10 and became more pronounced (90%) at 400 under similar assay ncs-mpp was significantly less efficient in irreversibly inhibiting agonist ligand [125i]8-oh-pipat binding to 5-ht1a receptors at lower concentrations after pretreatment of membranes with a low concentration of ncs-mpp there was an apparent loss of [125i]p-mppi binding as but no change in the binding affinity (kd) was the significant increase in kd at a higher concentration of ncs-mpp (50 nm) indicated that there may be a secondary alkylation which may not be directly involved in p-mppi binding to it would lead to an increased kd the availability of an irreversible may provide a useful tool for studies of 5-ht1a receptors in the central nervous
effects of chronic exercise on blood pressure in dahl salt-sensitive we tested the hypothesis that daily exercise would reduce directly measured arterial blood pressure (bp) and sympathetic nervous system support of bp in female dahl salt-sensitive rats consuming dahl s/jr inbred rats were assigned to daily exercise (ex) or sedentary (sed) treatment conditions (n = 12/group) at 4 weeks of rats in the ex group were housed in cages with attached running after 5 weeks of rats were running +/- after at least 5 wks of all rats in both groups were placed on a nacl diet for 2 weeks to produce sodium-induced rats continued to either exercise daily or remain sedentary for an additional 2 weeks while consuming the high sodium carotid and jugular catheters were then implanted for measurements in unrestrained rats on two separate daily wheel running exercise for 7 to 9 weeks did not alter bp or hr in dahl s/jr rats consuming a nacl acute arterial depressor responses to ganglionic blockade were less in ex greater alpha-adrenergic (phenylephrine-induced) pressor responses were observed in the ex group while under ganglionic the findings suggest that overall resting sympathetic neural activity or cardiac beta-adrenergic responsiveness to sympathetic activity is reduced in this model of hypertension by daily wheel running

induced preference or conditioned aversion for sodium chloride in rats with chronic bile duct we examined whether a learned aversion to saline could account for the reduction in saline intake produced by bile duct ligation (bdl) in rats and whether increased saline intake by bdl rats was associated with in three rats were given continuous access to water in choice with saline after in experiment rats were deprived of food and fluid for 24 h and then given 2-h access to either or m rats received a bdl or sham-ligation immediately (paired) or 48 h after (nonpaired) the 2-h bout of saline the results show that nonpaired bdl rats increased their daily saline intake relative to nonpaired sham-ligated or paired bdl rats approximately 1-4 weeks after in experiment when water and either cherry or grape kool-aid w/v) dissolved in m saline to distinguish the flavor of the solution was offered prior to bdl rats reduced their ingestion of grape-flavored saline after surgery regardless of whether they were exposed to grape- or cherry-flavored saline prior to in experiment when rats were offered water and m saline 48 h after bdl rats ligated for 4 weeks increased their saline intake relative to sham-ligated controls and this elevation in saline intake by bdl rats was associated with the results suggest that the symptoms associated with the bdl surgery can serve as effective unconditioned stimuli in the acquisition of learned flavor and that hypotension may play a role in the elevated intake of saline by bdl
differential misclassification and the assessment of gene-environment interactions in case-control in case-control studies of interactions between genetic and environmental differential misclassification of the environmental exposure with respect to disease status can introduce spurious heterogeneity of the stratum-specific odds in this the authors identify conditions under which differential misclassification does not introduce bias in the interaction parameter when no multiplicative interaction is and it biases the interaction parameter toward the null value when a multiplicative interaction is the conditions are that (i) conditional on potential the environmental exposure is independent of the genotype among the and (ii) misclassification of the environmental exposure is nondifferential with respect to the these conditions can be tested from the misclassified data in the control since a test of the independence of the genotype and the misclassified environmental exposure among the controls is a test of the joint hypothesis that conditions (i) and (ii) are both the authors propose a two-step test for interaction which first tests conditions (i) and (ii) and then goes on to test for provided the first step hypothesis is not a summary test procedure to test for gene-environment interactions in the presence of based on both a conventional test for interaction and the two-step is and is illustrated with data from a case-control study of the role of diet as a modifier of the association between a metabolic polymorphism and lung
tracer methods underestimate short-term variations in urea production in urea production rate (ra) is commonly measured using a primed continuous tracer urea but the accuracy of this method has not been clearly established in we used intravenous infusions of unlabeled urea to assess the accuracy of this technique in postabsorptive men under the following four different 1) tracer [13c]urea was infused under basal conditions for 12 h 2) tracer [13c]urea was infused for 12 and unlabeled urea was infused from hours 4 to 12 at a rate twofold greater than the endogenous ra 3) tracer [13c]urea was infused for 12 and unlabeled urea was infused from hours 4 to 8 and 4) tracer [13c]urea was infused for 9 and unlabeled alanine was infused at a rate of 120 from hours 4 to urea ra was calculated using the isotopic steady-state equation (tracer infusion rate/tracer-to-tracee non-steady-state and urinary urea excretion corrected for changes in total body for each endogenous urea ra was measured at hour 4 of the basal and the sum of this rate plus exogenous urea input was considered as urea under control urea ra at hour 4 was similar to that measured at hour after 8-h step and 4-h pulse unlabeled urea non-steady-state equation underestimated true urea input by 22% (step) and 33% whereas the nonisotopic method underestimated true urea input by 28% (step) and 10% similar conclusions were derived from the alanine these results indicate although non-steady-state equation and the nontracer method more accurately predict total urea ra than the steady-state they nevertheless seriously underestimate total urea ra for as long as 8 h after a change in true urea
a gel electrophoresis study of the competitive effects of monovalent counterion on the extent of divalent counterions binding to the behavior of alkaline earth metal cations (mg2+ and ca2+) and transition metal cations (zn2+ and cu2+) interacting with lambda-dna-hindiii fragments ranging from to bp in tris-borate-edta buffer solutions was the divalent counterions competed with tris+ and na+ for binding to polyion and the competition binding situations were investigated by measuring the reduction of the dna by pulsed- or constant-field gel the interaction of mg2+ with dna was intensively studied over a wide range of mg2+ in we examined the competition binding as a function of ionic strength and dna to compare valence we studied co(nh3)6(3+) interaction with dna fragments under conditions similar to that of at relatively low mg2+ the normalized titration curves of dna mobility were well fit by two-variable counterion condensation (cc) the agreement between the predicted value (total charge neutralization fraction theta) from cc theory and the data based on our measured dna electrophoretic mobility reduction was consistent under our experimental in contrast to alkaline earth metal cations (mg2+ and different binding behaviors were observed for the transition metal cations (zn2+ and these differences highlight the usefulness of our reduced dna electrophoretic mobility measurement approach to describing cation interactions with polyelectrolyte
zolpidem physical dependence assessed across increasing doses under a once-daily dosing regimen in the current study examined behavioral effects and possible development of physical dependence after once-daily doses of zolpidem mg/kg intragastrically in three each dose was administered for 17 days and then the dose was the mg/kg dose was administered for 27 baboons had access to food pellets for 20 hr/day beginning 15 min after each baboons were presented with a fine motor observation sessions were conducted 1 hr after dosing on days 12 and 14 of each dose condition and after termination of drug on days 10 and 14 of each dose vehicle and flumazenil (5 mg/kg were zolpidem increased the number of pellets obtained by two of three vomit and/or retch and grimace (signs believed to be indicative of abdominal discomfort) were observed in one or two baboons during all zolpidem dose conditions time to complete the fine motor task increased dose-dependently in all three and incoordination was observed during the task in two baboons at and analysis of blood plasma showed that measurable levels of zolpidem were present 24 hr after dosing in all drug the signs of flumazenil-precipitated withdrawal were summarized on a 9-point scores ranged from 1 to 5 in the mg/kg from 2 to 5 in the and mg/kg conditions and from 4 to 6 in the mg/kg signs that were considered intermediate in severity were jerk and/or rigidly braced posture was observed in one baboon at two baboons at the next two doses and all three baboons at vomit and/or retch also occurred in two baboons at dose conditions above discontinuation of zolpidem dosing after 78 to 79 days resulted in mild withdrawal signs number of pellets obtained were lower and number of 1-min intervals increased in which eyes were or in which lying head lower than torso posture and/or withdrawn posture were observed) on the first day in two the peak withdrawal scores were 4 or 5 on days 5 to two baboons vomited and/or retched and all three baboons showed jerk and/or rigidly braced zolpidem produced physical dependence under once-daily dosing and the severity of the withdrawal syndrome can be characterized as
inclusion of cholesterol in dotap transfection complexes increases the delivery of dna to cells in vitro in the presence of the contrast between the relative efficiency of transfection by cationic lipid reagents in vitro and that in vivo is well one suggested reason for this is the presence of competing polyanionic surfaces in blood and other biological and even in vitro transfections have to be performed in low-serum in this study we have shown that by preparing cationic lipid reagents based on dotap with cholesterol as a second constituent of the bilayer we can achieve significant levels of in vitro transfection in serum concentrations of up to 80% (dotap alone did not transfect at all in these in an effort to explain the behaviour of dotap/cholesterol mixes under these we examined the effect of serum on the transfection we could detect protein bound to each type of cationic lipid but there was no difference in the amount nor in the type of protein dna within either type of complex which were incubated with increasing amounts of serum remained resistant to digestion with dnase and there was no reduction in the condensation of the dna as measured by ethidium bromide we measured the attachment and uptake into cells by the different complexes in the presence of serum and showed that more dotap-cholesterol than dotap complexes attach to and are taken up by cells in the presence of we suggest that improved cell binding and uptake may be the main mechanism by which cholesterol acts to maintain transfection in the presence of
quantification of sphingosine derivatives in human inducible formation of free to elucidate the physiologic role of sphingolipid-derived products as signaling we analyzed the levels of endogenous sphingosine (sph) derivatives in human when the platelets were stimulated with thrombin or 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol neither ceramide formation nor sphingomyelin hydrolysis was which suggests that the sphingomyelin cycle may not be an essential part of the signaling pathway under these in sph was found to increase in platelets upon the level of sph which is formed from sph by the action of sph was not affected under our although it has been established that sph inhibits protein kinase which regulates the functional responses of the sph levels which exert an inhibitory effect on protein kinase c cannot be attained under physiological conditions (without exogenous considering the stimulation of the synthesis of sph by the physiological agonist we speculate that sph is a signaling molecule of physiological importance in but protein kinase c may not be its
mechanisms underlying the effects of unsignaled delayed reinforcement on key pecking of pigeons under variable-interval three experiments were conducted to test an interpretation of the response-rate-reducing effects of unsignaled nonresetting delays to reinforcement in according to this rates of key pecking decrease under these conditions because key pecks alternate with hopper-observing in experiment 4 pigeons pecked a food key that raised the hopper provided that pecks on a different variable-interval-schedule key met the requirements of a variable-interval 60-s the stimuli associated with the availability of the hopper houselight and keylight food key feedback following food-key pecks) were gradually removed across phases while the dependent relation between hopper availability and variable-interval-schedule key pecks was rates of pecking the variable-interval-schedule key decreased to low levels and rates of food-key pecks increased when variable-interval-schedule key pecks did not produce hopper-correlated in experiment pigeons initially pecked a single key under a variable-interval 60-s then the dependent relation between hopper presentation and key pecks was eliminated by arranging a variable-time 60-s when rates of pecking had decreased to low conditions were changed so that pecks during the final 5 s of each interval changed the keylight color from green to when pecking produced these hopper-correlated pecking occurred at high despite the absence of a peck-food when peck-produced changes in keylight color were uncorrelated with rates of pecking fell to low in experiment details (obtained interresponse-time eating times) of the transition from high to low response rates produced by the introduction of a 3-s unsignaled delay were tracked from session to session in 3 pigeons that had been initially trained to peck under a conventional variable-interval 60-s decreases in response rates soon after the transition to delayed reinforcement were accompanied by decreases in eating times and alterations in interresponse-time as response rates decreased and became eating times increased and their variability these findings support an interpretation of the effects of delayed reinforcement that emphasizes the importance of hopper-observing
characterisation of non-transferrin-bound iron (ferric citrate) uptake by rat hepatocytes in under conditions of iron overload plasma transferrin can be fully saturated and the plasma can transport non-transferrin-bound fe which is rapidly cleared by the much of this fe is complexed by the aim of the present work was to characterise the mechanisms by which fe-citrate is taken up by hepatocytes using a rat hepatocyte cell culture the after one day in were incubated with 59fe-labelled fe-citrate for varying time then washed and fe uptake to the membrane and intracellular compartments of the cell was determined by radioactivity maximal rates of internalisation of fe occurred at a molar ratio of or a ph of approximately and an extracellular ca2+ concentration of fe uptake showed michaelis-menten kinetics and was a temperature-dependent the k(m) and vmax for fe internalisation by the cells at 37 degrees c were approximately 7 microm and 2 nmol/mg dna/min (25 x 10(6) and the arrhenius activation energy was 35 the transition co2+ and inhibited fe uptake when used at 10 and 100 times the concentration of the rate of fe internalisation from fe-citrate was found to be approximately 20 times as great as that from fe-transferrin with fe concentrations of 1 and microm for both forms of the rate of fe uptake by iron-loaded hepatocytes obtained from rats which had been fed carbonyl fe was not significantly different from that by normal these experiments show that rat hepatocytes in primary culture have a high capacity to take up non-transferrin-bound fe in the form of fe-citrate and that uptake occurs by facilitated the iron transport process does not appear to be regulated by cellular fe
enhancement of tissue factor expression by vein segments exposed to coronary arterial although saphenous vein is the most reliable conduit for arterial interposition procedures in the coronary graft thrombosis remains a clinical we hypothesized that an important factor in early graft thrombosis is sudden change in the hemodynamic environment of the vein as it is placed in the coronary we used an ex vivo perfusion system to study freshly excised segments of human saphenous vein (hsv) and pig internal jugular for coronary graft (cavg) sections of hsv were subjected to arterial pulsatile pressure and flow and twisting and stretching to mimic deformations caused by the beating using functional and immunohistochemical we investigated the effect of these conditions on expression of tissue factor an important prothrombotic surface in each of 11 experiments (6 5 vein segments from a single donor were subjected to venous conditions cavg or no expression of tf was measured as the amount of factor xa generated per unit area of luminal vein ven perfusion did not cause a significant change in mean tf expression over nonperfused control values +/- versus +/- p = +/- versus +/- p = cavg perfusion led to significant enhancement of tf expression over ven perfusion +/- versus +/- p < +/- versus +/- p < immunohistochemical analysis showed positive tf staining on the luminal side of a cavg-stimulated hsv but not on a ven-stimulated in four additional hsv segments were subjected to arterial perfusion without twist and stretch to mimic lower extremity arterial interposition tf expression for lower extremity venous graft perfusion was significantly higher than for ven perfusion +/- versus +/- p < but not significantly different from cavg our studies in a unique perfusion system suggest that exposure of vein to coronary arterial hemodynamic conditions results in elevated expression of the important prothrombotic molecule this phenomenon may contribute to early graft
docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids are differently metabolized in rat liver during mitochondria and peroxisome the 3-thia fatty tetradecylthioacetic acid and acid are mitochondrion and peroxisome administration of these promotes an increased transport of endogenous fatty acids to these organelles and a higher capacity of administration of 3-thia fatty acids to rats resulted in a significant decrease of the hepatic level of docosahexaenoic acid (dha) (17-24%) and especially eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) (40-80%) accompanied by increased gene expression of mitochondrial reductase and enoyl-coa the mitochondrial oxidation of epa was increased more than 4-fold after administration of 3-thia fatty epa-coa was a good substrate for mitochondrial carnitine acyltransferase-i and treatment with 3-thia fatty acids increased the activity dha was a poor substrate for both mitochondrial and peroxisomal dha-coa was a very poor substrate for mitochondrial carnitine acyltransferase-i and and the activity did not increase after the peroxisomal dha-coa oxidase increased 10-fold after 3-thia fatty acid whereas the peroxisomal epa-coa oxidase increased only in isolated 16% of total metabolized epa was oxidized and 76% was incorporated into whereas dha was oxidized very we conclude that under conditions of increased mitochondrial and peroxisomal proliferation by 3-thia fatty a relatively higher oxidation rate of polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids might result in a decreased hepatic level of epa and under these conditions dha seems to be oxidized by the whereas which can be oxidized in both is mainly oxidized by
clustering of slowly adapting type ii mechanoreceptors in human peripheral nerve and the intrafascicular organization of human peripheral nerves was studied with percutaneous microneurography in the radial and peroneal nerves with one-surface or two-surface thin diameter concentric needle data from 33 recording sites containing 47 slowly adapting type ii (saii) units were at many sites sometimes even neighbouring saii units were recorded from the explored nerve fascicle and they had adjacent or even overlapping cutaneous receptive among pairs of saii units found at the same one unit often had ongoing whereas the other was silent under resting the neighbouring saii units were optimally activated by stretching the skin in different stretching the same skin area in different directions produced different unit clustered saii units were often found in sites where pacinian afferents and skin sympathetic activity were also no significant difference was observed in the degree of grouping of saii units either between recordings obtained with one-surface versus two-surface electrodes or between glabrous and hairy the data do not support the notion that myelinated fibres are randomly organized in peripheral nerve the findings suggest that saii units tend to be clustered in human peripheral the response of groups of saii units to skin stretch suggests that they play a role in dual channel recordings with two-surface concentric needle electrodes may provide a novel approach to study fibre organization in human peripheral nerves and the behaviour of groups of nerve
accelerated conditions for stability assessment of bulk and formulated cefaclor the stability of cefaclor monohydrate drug substance and formulated products was studied under accelerated conditions in order to provide a rapid indication of differences that might result from a change in manufacturing process or source of the the usp stability-indicating related substances assay was used to assess the extent of sample an arrhenius study of drug substance stability from 45 to 70 degrees c predicted a degradation rate consistent with that observed in room-temperature qualitative degradation profiles of samples held at 65 degrees c for 2 weeks were also very similar to those of samples held at room temperature for 2 based on these additional studies were conducted at 65 degrees c for 2 weeks on drug substance and formulated product stability differences were observed among some capsule formulations that had also exhibited real time in some rapid degradation after 5 days was observed at 65 degrees c followed by a slower rate from 5 to 15 similar behavior was observed for cefaclor monohydrate containing high amounts of amorphous suggesting that differences in amorphous content could be an explanation for stability differences observed in various the accelerated conditions were shown to differentiate samples and can provide a rapid indication of relative

regulation of hsf1 activation and hsp expression in mouse tissues under physiological stress the studies described above illustrate several important points concerning the study of the cellular stress they indicate that there are important differences between the nature of the stress response observed in tumor cell lines and that of primary cells of mouse caution should be exercised to avoid overextending and overinterpreting the results of studies using these cell lines until evidence can be obtained from in vivo studies on intact animals or primary cells of they reveal the existence of cell-type-dependent differences between cell types of the same thus potentially calling into question the supposed universal cytoprotective nature of the cellular stress future studies can address this question by determining the underlying mechanisms that regulate these cell-type-dependent differences in the stress and by determining whether there are biological reasons that some cell types exhibit differences in either the temperature set-point or magnitude of the stress
survival and function of hepatocytes on a novel three-dimensional synthetic biodegradable polymer scaffold with an intrinsic network of channels[see to evaluate the survival and function of hepatocytes (hcs) on a novel three-dimensional (3d) synthetic biodegradable polymer scaffold with an intrinsic network of interconnected channels under continuous flow summary background the laboratory has investigated hc transplantation using 3d biodegradable polymers as scaffolding as an alternative approach to treatment of end-stage liver previous studies have demonstrated survival of hcs transplanted on polymer discs in peripheral tissue sites and partial correction of single enzyme liver one of the major limitations has been the insufficient survival of an adequate mass of transplanted this is thought to be caused by inadequate oxygen hcs and nonparenchymal liver cells from lewis rats were seeded onto 3d biodegradable polymer microporous 3d polymers were created using 3d printing on copolymers of the cell/polymer constructs were placed in static culture or continuous flow the devices were retrieved after 2 days and examined by scanning electron microscopy and culture medium was analyzed for albumin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay differences in culture parameters including and hco3 were scanning electron microscopy revealed successful attachment of hcs on the 3d polymer in both static and flow histology demonstrated viable hcs in both elisa demonstrated a significantly higher mean concentration of albumin in flow conditions than in static culture parameter analysis revealed a significantly higher po2 and glucose and a more physiologic ph in flow conditions than in static hcs cocultured with nonparenchymal cells can attach to and survive on the 3d polymer scaffolds in both static and flow conditions in the size and configuration used in this flow conditions may provide a more conducive environment for hc metabolism and albumin synthesis than static the authors hypothesize that flow through directed channels will be necessary for the transfer of large masses of cells when implantation studies are
the comorbidity of alcoholism with anxiety and depressive disorders in four geographic the comorbidity of alcoholism with anxiety and depressive disorders was examined in four epidemiologic investigations from diverse geographic despite variability in lifetime prevalence rates for these there was strong cross-site consistency in the magnitude and specific patterns of individuals with alcohol abuse or dependence generally experienced a twofold to threefold increased risk of anxiety and depressive phobic conditions typically preceded the onset of but no systematic pattern was observed for panic or depressive considerable heterogeneity was also observed concerning the impact of comorbid conditions on symptoms of the index while the presence of comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders was consistently associated with moderate increases in the symptoms of alcohol abuse or alcoholism was associated with large increases in the number of depressive symptoms and little or no increase in phobic the findings are discussed in terms of the self-medication hypothesis and the etiologic heterogeneity of these forms of comorbidity in the general

mass spectrometric evidence that agents that cause loss of ca2+ from intracellular compartments induce hydrolysis of arachidonic acid from pancreatic islet membrane phospholipids by a mechanism that does not require a rise in cytosolic ca2+ stimulation of pancreatic islets with glucose induces phospholipid hydrolysis and accumulation of nonesterified arachidonic which may amplify the glucose-induced ca2+ entry into islet beta-cells that triggers insulin ca2+ loss from beta-cell intracellular compartments has been proposed to induce both ca2+ entry and events dependent on arachidonate we examine here effects of inducing ca2+ loss from intracellular sequestration sites with ionophore a23187 and thapsigargin on arachidonate hydrolysis from islet a23187 induces a decline in islet arachidonate-containing phospholipids and release of nonesterified a23187-induced arachidonate release is of similar magnitude when islets are stimulated in ca2+-replete or in ca2+-free media or when islets loaded with the intracellular ca2+ chelator bapta are stimulated in ca2+-free a condition in which a23187 induces no rise in beta-cell cytosolic thapsigargin also induces islet arachidonate release under these a23187- or thapsigargin-induced arachidonate release is prevented by a bromoenol lactone (bel) inhibitor of a beta-cell phospholipase a2 which does not require ca2+ for catalytic activity and which is negatively modulated by and physically interacts with calmodulin by ca2+-dependent agents that cause ca2+ loss from islet intracellular compartments thus induce arachidonate hydrolysis from phospholipids by a bel-sensitive mechanism that does not require a rise in cytosolic and a bel-sensitive enzyme-like ipla2 or a related membranous activity may participate in sensing ca2+ compartment
