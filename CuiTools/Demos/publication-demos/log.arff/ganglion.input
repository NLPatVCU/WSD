innervation of the neurochemical and physiological properties of guinea pig gallbladder the muscle and epithelial tissues of the gallbladder are regulated by a ganglionated plexus that lies within the wall of the although these ganglia are derived from the same set of precursor neural crest cells that colonize the they exhibit neurochemical and physiological characteristics that are distinct from the myenteric and submucous plexuses of the enteric nervous the ganglionated plexus of the guinea pig gallbladder is comprised of small clusters of neurons that are located in the outer wall of the between the serosa and underlying smooth the ganglia are encapsulated by a shell of fibroblasts and a basal and are devoid of gallbladder neurons are rather simple in consisting of a a few short dendritic processes and one or two long results reported here indicate that all gallbladder neurons are probably cholinergic since they all express immunoreactivity for choline the majority of these neurons also express substance neuropeptide and and a small remaining population of neurons express vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip) immunoreactivity and nadph-diaphorase enzymatic we report here that nadph-diaphorase nitric oxide synthase and vip immunoreactivity are expressed by the same neurons in the physiological studies indicate that the ganglia of the gallbladder are the site of action of the following neurohumoral 1) all neurons receive nicotinic input from vagal preganglionic 2) norepinephrine released from sympathetic postganglionic fibers acts presynaptically on vagal terminals within gallbladder ganglia to decrease the release of acetylcholine from vagal 3) substance p and calcitonin gene-related which are co-expressed in sensory cause prolonged depolarizations of gallbladder neurons that resemble slow and 4) cholecystokinin (cck) acts presynaptically within gallbladder ganglia to increase the release of acetylcholine from vagal results reported here indicate that hormonal cck can readily access gallbladder since there is no evidence for a blood-ganglionic barrier in the taken these results indicate that gallbladder ganglia are not simple relay but rather sites of complex modulatory interactions that ultimately influence the functions of muscle and epithelial cells in the
patterns of connectivity in a drosophila we investigated the spatial patterns of synaptic profiles in en passant synapses between the premotor axon of a peripherally synapsing interneuron (papsi) and a set of individually identifiable motoneuron axons in drosophila these synaptic profiles are distributed as the axons travel parallel to each other in a the synapses begin as the axons leave the thoracic ganglion and continue peripherally for 45-65 we found that the number of synaptic profiles per micron length of the motoneuron axons was greatest close to the the cumulative distribution of profiles could be fitted to curves of the form f(x) = alpha(1 - e(-beta where x = the distance from the thoracic and alpha and beta are the distribution of synaptic profiles was also examined in a mutant passover known to affect connectivity in a pathway that includes the the synaptic profiles between the papsi and the motoneuron axons appeared ultrastructurally unremarkable in the total number of synaptic profiles between the papsi and the motoneuron axons did not differ between pas and wild type the distribution of synaptic profiles among the individual motoneuron axons did differ significantly from wild type as did the area of contiguity between the motoneuron axons and the which was much greater in pas than in wild type
origin and route of tangentially migrating neurons in the developing neocortical intermediate neuroblasts produced in the ventricular zone of the neocortex migrate radially and form the cortical settling in an inside-out it is also well known that the tangential cell migration is not negligible in the embryonic to have a better understanding of the tangential cell migration in the we disturbed the migration by making a cut in the and we labeled the migrating cells with perchlorate (dii) in vivo and in we also determined the birth dates of the disturbance of tangential cell migration caused an accumulation and disappearance of microtubule-associated protein 2 immunoreactive (map2-ir) cells on the ventral and dorsal side of the which indicated that most of the map2-ir cells in the intermediate zone (iz) were migrating toward the dorsal the dii injection study in vivo confirmed the tendency of the direction of cell migration and suggested the origin of the cells to be in the lateral ganglionic eminence dii injection into the lge in vitro confirmed that the lge cells cross the corticostriatal boundary and enter the iz of the the migrating cells acquired multipolar shape in the iz of the dorsal cortex and seemed to reside a 5-bromo-deoxyuridine incorporation study revealed that the migrating map2-ir cells in the iz were early-generated we concluded that the majority of tangentially migrating cells were generated in the lge and identified as a distinct population that was assumed not to have joined the cortical
morphometric determination of the methodological criteria for the diagnosis of intestinal neuronal dysplasia (ind intestinal neuronal dysplasia of the submucous plexus (ind b) is an indicator of a developmental abnormality of vegetative gut it is the mildest form of an inborn error of intestinal the diagnosis of ind b does not result in a functional conclusion or clinical recommendation but is often accompanied by oligoneuronal hypoganglionosis of the myenteric plexus or an aganglionosis of the the aim of this study was to demonstrate by morphometric means a way in which the diagnosis of ind b could be made much more in 20 control 40 ind b cases and 10 hypoganglionoses with ind it was shown that a specific nerve cell staining lactic succinic diaphorase reaction or an immunohistochemical nerve cell staining) was necessary for cross sections of giant ganglions and cross sections with large nerve cell numbers (> 7 nerve cell profiles) were the most reliable diagnostic the morphometric examinations were performed with an optic electronic image analysis biopsy serial sections of the rectum-mucosa that contained submucosa demonstrated that 30-40% of the sections contained no submucous sixty to 70% of the sections showed ganglia of the submucous in 100 biopsy sections in subjects with ind 20 +/- 5% contained giant ganglions cross in the patients with hypoganglionosis of the submucous 55 +/- 4% sections had no ganglion and 18 +/- 3% had giant ganglion cross the data demonstrate that for a reliable diagnosis of ind at least 30 sections are stained with a dehydrogenase reaction that contain a minimum of 4 giant ganglion cross these data demonstrate that ind b is not a qualitative diagnosis as disease but rather a quantitative

effect of ganglionic blocking compounds on in-vivo fluid secretion in the rat small it is well-known that secreto-motor nerves mediate cholera toxin-induced fluid secretion in the rat small this notion in derived from experiments on anaesthetized animals in which the response to cholera toxin was antagonized by the ganglionic nicotinic receptor in the current such anti-secretory action of ganglionic blocking compounds was analysed in an experiment designed to minimize any possible negative effect of general anaesthesia on intestinal rats were anaesthetized with ether for 5-10 during which time a jejunal loop (10-12 cm) was the loop was challenged with one of the cholera prostaglandin e1 (pge1) or okadaic saline (control) or either of the ganglionic hexamethonium and was administered the rats were killed 5 h (cholera toxin) or h (pge1 and okadaic acid) after and the amount of fluid accumulated in the loops was cholera toxin-induced secretion was unchanged by hexamethonium but reduced by approximately 80% by the difference in effect between the two blockers might relate to the duration of ganglionic chlorisondamine blocked secretion induced by either pge1 or okadaic acid by approximately it is suggested that the anti-secretory effect of ganglionic blocking compounds might be a result of blockade of secreto-motor nerves but other for example interference with haemodynamic cannot be ruled
and effects of infraorbital nerve transection on galanin binding sites in the trigeminal brainstem previous experiments from this laboratory have indicated that transection of the infraorbital nerve the trigeminal [v] branch that supplies the mystacial vibrissae follicles) at birth and in adulthood has markedly different effects on galanin immunoreactivity in the v brainstem adult nerve transection increases galanin immunoreactivity in the superficial layers of v subnucleus caudalis (spc) while neonatal nerve transection results in increased galanin expression in vibrissae-related primary afferents throughout the v brainstem the present study describes the distribution of binding sites for this peptide in the mature and developing v ganglion and brainstem complex and determines the effects of neonatal and adult ion damage and the associated changes in galanin levels upon their distribution and galanin binding sites are densely distributed in all v brainstem subnuclei and are particularly dense in v subnucleus interpolaris and the superficial layers of they are present at birth (p-0) and their distribution is similar to that in adult transection of the ion in adulthood and examination of brainstem 7 days later indicated marked reductions in the density of galanin binding sites in the v brainstem with the exception of the superficial laminae of the same reduction in density remained apparent in rats that survived > 45 days after nerve transection of the ion on p-0 resulted in no change in the density of galanin binding sites in the brainstem after either 7 or > 60 days these results indicate that densely distributed galanin binding sites are present in the v brainstem complex of both neonatal and adult that they are located in regions not innervated by galanin-positive and that their density is not significantly influenced by large lesion-induced changes in the primary afferent content of their natural
amine modulation of glutamate responses from pyloric motor neurons in lobster stomatogastric the amines dopamine serotonin and octopamine (oct) each elicit a distinctive motor pattern from a quiescent pyloric network in the lobster stomatogastric ganglion we previously have demonstrated that these amines alter the synaptic strength at distributed sites within the pyloric network that could contribute to the amine-induced motor we examined the postsynaptic contribution to these changes in synaptic strength by determining how the amines modify responses of pyloric motor neurons to glutamate one of the network applied iontophoretically into the stg dopamine reduced the glu responses of the pyloric dilator ventricular dilator and inferior cardiac (ic) neurons and enhanced the glu responses of the lateral pyloric (lp) and pyloric constrictor (py) the only effect of 5-ht was to reduce the glu response of the vd oct enhanced the glu responses of the lp and py neurons but did not affect the and ic we also examined amine effects on the depolarizing responses to iontophoresed acetylcholine (ach) in the pd and vd and found that they paralleled the amine effects on glu responses in these this suggests that amine modulation of pd and vd responses to glu and ach may be explained by general changes in the ionic conductance of these we compare our results with our earlier work describing amine effects on synaptic strength and input resistance to show that amines act at both pre- and postsynaptic sites to modify graded synaptic transmission in the pyloric
dopaminergic modulation of inhibitory glutamate receptors in the lobster stomatogastric the intrinsic rhythmicity of the spiny lobster stomatogastric ganglion (stg) is strongly influenced by the strengths of the graded synapses between identified cells within the neural these synaptic strengths can be powerfully influenced by chemical neuromodulators such as dopamine and most of the intraganglionic chemical synapses in the stg are mediated by postsynaptic inhibitory glutamate receptors to determine whether or not direct effects on these iglurs contribute to the modulation of synaptic unidentified stg neurons were extracted into primary culture and the effects of these aminergic neuromodulators on the glutamate-evoked membrane current were dopamine (100 microm) reliably and significantly reduced the whole cell slope conductance of all iglurs serotonin (20 microm) never affected the iglu although it clearly altered other cellular membrane although all identified stg neurons may not conform to these the data reveal a specific dopamine-activated modulatory pathway within cultured neurons that reduces iglur slope the relationship between iglur modulation and net synaptic modulation in situ contributes to an emerging model in which synaptic strengths can be multiply modulated at different functional yielding a and state-dependent regulatory
vagal control of left ventricular contractility is selectively mediated by a cranioventricular intracardiac ganglion in the activation of the vagus nerve leads to decreases in sinoatrial (sa) atrioventricular (av) and myocardial previous data are consistent with the hypothesis that vagal control of cardiac rate and av conduction are mediated by two anatomically separated and physiologically independent parasympathetic intracardiac ganglia located in fat pads on the surface of the right and left these data suggested that vagal control of ventricular contractility might be mediated through another intracardiac we examined the ventricles of cat hearts histologically for the presence of multiple small basophilic ganglia composed of a few and an occasional larger ganglion were found embedded in the epicardial fat surrounding the cranial margin of the anterior surface of the left near the juncture with the right which we refer to as the cv in anesthetized right cervical vagal stimulation decreased sa rate by 44 +/- decreased the rate of av conduction by 68 +/- and reduced ventricular contractility by +/- vagally induced negative inotropism was almost completely prevented by microinjection of a ganglionic blocking drug into the cv these injections into the cv ganglion did not significantly effect vagally induced decreases in either sa rate or av we (1) that ganglia are found in a fat pad on the surface of the left ventricle of the cat heart and (2) that the cv ganglion selectively mediates the negative inotropic effect of vagal stimulation on the left greater understanding of the physiological functions of intracardiac neuronal circuits may help in developing new strategies to treat disorders of cardiac contractility such as congestive heart
identification of an inhibin receptor in gonadal tumors from inhibin alpha-subunit knockout inhibins and activins are dimeric proteins that are functional antagonists and are structurally related to the transforming growth factor-beta (tgfbeta) family of growth and differentiation receptors for activin and tgfbeta have been identified as dimers of serine-threonine kinase subunits that regulate cytoplasmic proteins known as despite major advances in our understanding of activin and tgfbeta receptors and signaling little is known about inhibin receptors or the mechanism by which this molecule provides a functionally antagonistic signal to studies described in this paper indicate that an independent inhibin receptor numerous tissues were examined for inhibin-specific binding including the developing in which the spinal ganglion and trigeminal ganglion-bound iodinated inhibin sex cord stromal derived from male and female inhibin alpha-subunit-deficient were also identified as a source of inhibin abundant inhibin and few activin binding sites were identified in tumor tissue sections by in situ ligand binding using iodinated recombinant human inhibin a and 125i-labeled recombinant human inhibin tumor cell binding was specific for each ligand (competed by excess unlabeled homologous ligand and not competed by heterologous based on these results and the relative abundance and homogeneity of tumor tissues versus the embryonic tumor tissues were membrane proteins were and putative inhibin receptors were isolated using an inhibin affinity four proteins were eluted from the column that bind iodinated inhibin but not iodinated these data suggest that inhibin-specific membrane-associated proteins (receptors)
transient somatostatin-immunoreactive ganglion cells in the developing rat the peptide somatostatin (srif) is likely to play important roles in neuronal differentiation and in the mammalian it is reported to be expressed by populations of amacrine and/or displaced amacrine cells in some by some ganglion previous studies have shown that in the rat retina the maturation of somatostatinergic systems encompasses late prenatal and early postnatal suggesting a role of srif in maturative events of the srif-expressing ganglion cells have not been reported in the rat retina at any developmental in the present we re-evaluated the postnatal development of srif-containing neurons of the rat retina focusing on the analysis of srif-containing cells in the ganglion cell layer to test the possibility that srif is expressed by some ganglion cells during to this aim we combined immunocytochemical staining of srif-positive neurons with retrograde tracing of ganglion cell bodies through fluoro-gold injections into the superior double-labelling experiments revealed the presence of srif-containing ganglion cells at postnatal day (pnd) they accounted for 14% of the total srif-containing cells in the such double-labelled cells were not observed either before (pnd 7) or after (pnd 15 and pnd 45) this this transient expression of srif in retinal ganglion cells suggests that srif may be a factor regulating the maturation of retinocollicular projections in a restricted period of postnatal
a role for l-type calcium channels in developmental regulation of transmitter phenotype in primary sensory to examine the influence of activity-dependent cues on differentiation of primary afferent we investigated the short- and long-term effects of depolarization and calcium influx on expression of transmitter traits in sensory ganglion cell we focused on expression of tyrosine hydroxylase a marker for dopaminergic in developing petrosal ganglion nodose and dorsal root ganglion neurons grown in the presence or absence of depolarizing concentrations of exposure to 40 mm kcl increased the proportion of th-immunoreactive neurons in all three ganglia in a developmentally regulated manner that corresponded to the temporal pattern of dopaminergic expression in pg for were most responsive to elevated kcl on embryonic day the age at which the dopaminergic phenotype is first detectable in kcl was relatively ineffective at increasing th expression in neonatal indicating a critical period for induction of this phenotype by detailed analysis of th induction in pg neurons demonstrated although n-type calcium channels carried the majority of the high voltage-activated calcium only l-type calcium channel blockade inhibited the effect of elevated further studies revealed that after removal of high neurons remained sensitized to subsequent stimulation for >1 cultures exposed to kcl beginning on (the conditioning then returned to control and subsequently re-exposed to elevated kcl after 9 d (the test stimulus) contained fourfold more th-positive neurons than did cultures exposed to the test stimulus blockade of l-type calcium channels during the conditioning stimulus completely abolished long-term potentiation of the th response to elevated these findings demonstrate a novel role for l-type calcium channels in activity-dependent plasticity of transmitter expression in sensory neurons and indicate that exposure to depolarizing stimuli during early development may alter neuronal response properties at later
accumulation of viral transcripts and dna during establishment of latency by herpes simplex latent infection of mice with wild-type herpes simplex virus is established during an acute phase of ganglionic infection in which there is abundant viral replication and productive-cycle gene thymidine kinase-negative mutants establish latent infections but are severely impaired for acute ganglionic replication and productive-cycle gene by in situ hybridization acute infection by these mutants resembles to assess events during establishment of latency by wild-type and thymidine kinase-negative we quantified specific viral nucleic acid sequences in mouse trigeminal ganglia during acute ganglionic infection by using sensitive pcr-based through 32 h viral dna and transcripts representative of the three kinetic classes of productive-cycle genes accumulated to comparable levels in wild-type- and mutant-infected at 48 and 72 although latency-associated transcripts accumulated to comparable levels in ganglia infected with wild-type or mutant levels of dna accumulating in wild-type-infected ganglia exceeded those in mutant-infected ganglia by 2 to 3 orders of coincident with this increase in wild-type-infected ganglia exhibited abundant expression of productive-cycle genes and high titers of infectious the levels of productive-cycle rnas expressed by mutant virus during acute infection greatly exceeded those expressed by wild-type virus during the results thus distinguish acute infection of ganglia by a replication-compromised mutant from latent infection and may have implications for mechanisms of
quantitative and somatotopic mapping of neurones in the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus and ganglion innervating teeth in monkey and neurones of the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus (mes v) and ganglion innervating the periodontium of canine and molar teeth in 10 monkeys and 10 baboons were counted and mapped using the horseradish peroxidase retrograde axonal transport periodontal afferent neurones of all these teeth were well represented in the mes although the incisors had a significantly higher number of labelled neurones than the canines or the primary cell bodies of the periodontal afferents were located mainly in the caudal part of the ipsilateral mes v from the level of the inferior colliculus to the floor of the fourth ventricle in the the caudal periodontal mes v neurones may be favourably located to make collateral connections with the trigeminal motor nucleus for jaw incisors and canines had a large and predominantly ipsilateral representation of hrp-labelled neurones in the in molar representation in the ganglion was sparse and all labelled neurones supplied ipsilateral the maxillary and mandibular teeth had a somatotopic distribution within the respective maxillary (middle) and mandibular (posterolateral) compartments of the trigeminal it is suggested that the anterior teeth with greater connections to the mes v and the ganglion may impart greater sensory perception and be involved in jaw reflexes to ensure a good occlusal relation during while the afferent connections of the molars may initiate complex jaw reflexes during the occlusal phase of

insulin secretion by gastrin-releasing peptide in ganglionic versus direct islet gastrin-releasing peptide (grp) stimulates insulin secretion by a direct islet in this we initially by immunocytochemistry of the mouse grp immunoreactive nerve fibers within exocrine and intrapancreatic a more pronounced grp innervation was found in ganglia compared with in we therefore studied whether indirect cholinergic mechanisms contribute to the insulinotropic action of in the insulinotropic response to grp nmol/kg was inhibited by the muscarinic receptor antagonist 4-diphenylacetoxy-n-methyl piperidine methobromide by p < and by the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium (28 by p < in in isolated 4-damp or hexamethonium (10 or 100 microm) did not inhibit grp (100 nm)-induced insulin afferent denervation by neonatal capsaicin did not affect the insulin response to we conclude that the insulinotropic effect of grp in the mouse is mediated by both direct islet effects and through at the ganglionic of postganglionic cholinergic in the indirect cholinergic mechanism
ganglionic distribution of inputs and outputs of a neuron involved in the generation of a food-induced arousal state in aplysia [published erratum appears in invert neurosci 1997 cerebral neuron c-pr is thought to play an important role in the appetitive phase of feeding behavior of we describe the organization of input and output pathways of intracellular dye fills of c-pr revealed extensive arborization of processes within the cerebral and the pedal numerous varicosities of varying sizes may provide points of synaptic inputs and blocking polysynaptic transmission in the cerebral ganglion eliminated the sensory inputs to c-pr from stimuli applied to the rhinophores or indicating that this input is probably mediated by cerebral identified cerebral mechanoafferent sensory neurons polysynaptically excite stimulation of the eyes and rhinophores with light depresses c-pr spike and this effect also appears to be mediated by cerebral c-pr has bilateral synaptic actions on numerous pedal ganglion and also has effects on cerebral including the bn cbis and the contralateral although the somata of these cerebral neurons are physically close to experiments using high divalent cation-containing solutions and cutting of various connectives indicated that the effects of c-pr on other cerebral ganglion neurons (specifically bn cells and the mcc) are mediated by interneurons that project back to the cerebral ganglion via the pedal and pleural the indirect pathways of c-pr to other cerebral neurons may help to ensure that consummatory motor programs are not activated until the appropriate appetitive motor mediated by the pedal have begun to be
autoregulation of renal blood flow in the conscious dog and the contribution of the tubuloglomerular the aim of this study was to investigate the autoregulation of renal blood flow under physiological when challenged by the normal pressure and the contribution of the tubuloglomerular feedback the transfer function between and hz was calculated from the spontaneous fluctuations in renal arterial blood pressure (rabp) and renal blood flow (rbf) in conscious resting the response of rbf to stepwise artificially induced reductions in rabp was also studied (stepwise under control conditions (n = 12 the gain of the transfer function started to indicating improving below hz (t = 7-17 at hz a prominent peak of high gain was below hz (t > 100 the gain reached a minimum (maximal autoregulation) of +/- the stepwise autoregulation (n = 4) was much stronger the time delay of the transfer function was remarkably constant from to hz (high frequency (hf) range) at and from to hz (low frequency) (lf) range) at infused into the renal abolished the stepwise autoregulation +/- n = the gain of the transfer function (n = 4) remained high down to in the lf range it was higher than in the control +/- p < the time delay in the hf range was reduced to s (p < after ganglionic blockade (n = 7) no major changes in the transfer function were under furosemide (frusemide) (40 mg + 10 mg h-1 or 300 mg + 300 mg h-1 the stepwise autoregulation was impaired to +/- or +/- respectively (n = in the transfer function (n = 7 or n = 4) the peak at hz was the delay in the lf range was reduced to or the transfer gain in the lf range +/- or +/- respectively) did not differ from the control but was smaller than that under nifedipine (p < it is concluded that the ample capacity for regulation of rbf is only partially employed under physiological the abolition by nifedipine and the negligible effect of ganglionic blockade show that above hz it is almost exclusively due to autoregulation by the kidney tgf contributes to the maximum autoregulatory but it is not required for the level of autoregulation expended under physiological around tgf even reduces the degree of

long-term changes in excitability induced by protein kinase c activation in aplysia sensory protein kinases a (pka) and c (pkc) play a central role as intracellular transducers during simple forms of learning in these two proteins seem to cooperate in mediating the different forms of plasticity underlying behavioral modifications of defensive reflexes in a state- and time-dependent although short- and long-term changes in the synaptic efficacy of the connections between mechanosensory neurons and motoneurons of the reflex have been well there is also a distinct intermediate phase of plasticity that is not as well biochemical and physiological experiments have suggested a role for pkc in the induction and expression of this form of in this we demonstrate that pkc activation can induce both intermediate- and long-term changes in the excitability of sensory neurons short application of 4beta-phorbol ester a potent activator of produced a long-lasting increase in the number of spikes fired by sns in response to depolarizing current this effect was observed in isolated cell culture and in the intact it was blocked by a selective pkc inhibitor the increase in excitability measured at an intermediate-term time point (3 h) after treatment was independent of protein while it was disrupted at the long-term (24 h) time point by the general protein synthesis in addition to suggesting that pkc as well as pka are involved in long-lasting excitability these findings support the idea that memory formation involves multiple stages that are mechanistically distinct at the biochemical

spontaneous ca2+ transients and their transmission in the developing chick the development of the central nervous system is dependent on spontaneous action potentials and changes in [ca2+]i occurring in neurons in the mammalian waves of spontaneous electrical activity spread between retinal raising [ca2+]i as they pass in the ferret the first spontaneous ca2+ waves have been reported at postnatal day 2 and are thought to result from the ca2+ influx associated with bursts of action potentials seen in ganglion cells at this time these waves depend on depolarisation produced by voltage-gated sodium but their initiation and/or propagation also depends upon nicotinic cholinergic synaptic transmission between amacrine cells and ganglion cells we report contrasting results for the chick retina where ca2+ transients are seen at times before retinal synapse formation but when there are extensive networks of gap these ca2+ transients do not require nicotinic cholinergic transmission but are modulated by acetylcholine dopamine and they propagate into the depth of the suggesting that they are not restricted to ganglion and amacrine the transients are abolished by the gap-junctional blocker the ca2+ transients seen early in chick retinal development are triggered and propagate in the absence of synapses by a mechanism that involves several neurotransmitters and gap
a reexamination of the synaptic connection between neuron l7 of the abdominal ganglion and neurons of the branchial ganglion in aplysia kurodai and the presence of a synaptic connection between neuron l7 of the abdominal ganglion and branchial ganglionic neurons (bgns) was reexamined by means of electrophysiology and fluorescent microscopy using three aplysia we succeeded in recording excitatory postsynaptic potentials produced in a which followed impulses of l7 one-to-one with a constant even in californica as well as in kurodai and dye-injection revealed that fine collaterals extended from a major branch of l7 to the branchial ganglion and arborized in neuropil of the the results show that l7 in the three species has a dual function as a motor neuron and as an interneuron for the
morphological study of the intrapharyngeal ganglia and ganglionic neurons in the number and nature of intrapharyngeal ganglia and their neurons in cats were examined by means of serial histochemical and immunohistochemical six to eight large ganglia around the palatine tonsils and five to eight small ganglia in the laterodorsal wall of pharyngeal mucous membrane were the intrapharyngeal ganglionic neuron (25-30 microns in diameter) totalled 600-800 and more than 80% of them were located around the palatine the ganglionic neurons were acetylcholinesterase reaction on many choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-immunoreactive neurons and a few tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive nerve cells were but no calcitonin gene-related peptide-immunoreactive or substance p-immunoreactive neurons were recognized in the the present findings indicate that intrapharyngeal ganglionic neurons are mainly parasympathetic and partially sympathetic in
the application of radio-opaque markers prior to ileostomy in an infant with chronic intestinal report of a we report the case of a 6-month-old boy who developed chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction soon after a rectal biopsy demonstrated immaturity of the neuronal cells in the enteral his clinical course was with remission and exacerbation despite conservative treatment with daily bowel prokinetic and parenteral since the infant developed serious enterocolitis associated with the increased severity of his bowel and no substantial gain in body weight was a loop-ileostomy was performed based on x-ray findings with radio-opaque which were employed to evaluate the whole gut transit the radio-opaque markers proved extremely useful for determining which loop of the ileum should be utilized for the
depressed heart rate variability and arterial baroreflex in conscious transgenic mice with overexpression of cardiac we developed a transgenic mouse with cardiac-specific gsalpha overexpression (tg which exhibits enhanced postsynaptic beta-adrenergic receptor ultimately developing a the goal of the present study was to determine whether cardiac gsalpha overexpression alters autonomic cardiovascular which could shed light on the mechanism responsible for the later development of mean arterial pressure was increased in chronically instrumented tg mice (123+/-1 mm hg) compared with age-matched wild-type (wt) control mice (103+/-1 mm respiratory frequency was increased in tg mice (269+/-26/min) compared with wt mice by use of telemetric baseline heart rate (hr) was elevated in untethered tg mice (696+/-13 bpm) compared with wt mice (568+/-28 intrinsic after propranolol and atropine or after ganglionic blockade with was not different between tg and wt both the normal minute-to-minute and circadian variations of hr observed in wt mice were markedly blunted in tg hr variability was assessed by the time-domain and frequency-domain at time-domain analysis indices were reduced in tg mice compared with wt although the low frequency (lf) component was higher than the high frequency (hf) component in wt the lf component was less than the hf component in tg in arterial baroreflex regulation of hr was markedly blunted in tg mice in response to both nitroglycerin-induced hypotension and phenylephrine-induced the reduced lf/hf ratio in tg mice was surprising in view of enhanced beta-adrenergic signaling and may be due to reduced neural tone secondary to the elevated arterial pressure or alterations in arterial baroreflex dobutamine infusion in wt mice also resulted in depressed hr the combination of elevated baseline arterial and respiratory frequency suggests that enhanced beta-adrenergic signaling in tg mice results in reduced hr in terms of both minute-to-minute variability and the lack of circadian variations in the lack of normal hr variability in general and the failure of hr to even during may actually be critical mechanisms contributing to the ultimate development of cardiomyopathy in these

sympathetic axons surround nerve growth factor-immunoreactive trigeminal observations in mice overexpressing nerve growth it has been postulated that the aberrant projection of sympathetic axons to individual primary sensory neurons may provide the morphological basis for pain-related behaviors in rat models of chronic pain since nerve growth factor (ngf) can elicit the collateral sprouting of noradrenergic sympathetic it might be predicted that ngf plays a role in mediating the sprouting of sympathetic axons into sensory using a line of transgenic mice overexpressing ngf among glial it was first found that trigeminal ganglia from adult transgenic mice possessed significantly higher levels of ngf protein in comparison to age-matched wild-type as detectable levels of ngf mrna transgene expression were present in both the ganglia and brain within the trigeminal a small proportion of the sensory neuronal population stained immunohistochemically for a higher percentage of ngf-positive neurons was evident in transgenic new sympathetic axons extended into the trigeminal ganglia of transgenic mice only and formed perineuronal plexuses surrounding only those neurons immunostained for in such plexuses were accompanied by glial processes from nonmyelinating schwann from these we propose that accumulation of glial-derived ngf by adult sensory neurons and its putative release into the ganglionic environment induce the directional growth of sympathetic axons to the source of the cell bodies of primary sensory
expression of and atf-2 proteins in axotomized explanted and cultured adult rat dorsal root the expression of c-fos and atf-2 transcription factors was studied in l4/l5 dorsal root ganglion neurons of adult in order to determine the extent to know to which extend the expression of transcription factors in vitro parallels the pathophysiological expression in dorsal root ganglia were dissociated and cultured for up to 15 days in vitro the dorsal root and the peripheral nerve fibres were transected close at the dorsal root and the completely axotomized dorsal root ganglia were kept in artificial cerebrospinal fluid for up to 24 this procedure (explantation) preserves the intraganglionic morphology culture evoked a persistent expression of c-jun and jund in the majority of small neurons independent on neurite in the number of large neurons with c-jun decreased and with jund increased with incubation junb and which were also visible in the majority of strongly decreased with culture time in both small and large atf-2 was visible in the vast majority of neurons and did not change during the observation incubation with brain-derived neurotrophic factor for 15 days reduced junb expression and raised c-fos but did not affect c-jun or jund explantation of dorsal root ganglia evoked a dramatic and rapid induction of c-jun in neurons located in the periphery of the an area that showed prominent apoptosis as visualized by transferase dutp nick followed by a delayed increase in neurons of the central parts of dorsal root expression of junb showed a dramatic increase within 2 h in the whole but disappeared within the following jund dropped from its basal levels within 4 h and was almost absent after 8 c-fos did not appear until 6 when transferase dutp nick end-labelling also became and remained visible in a rather small number of as with incubation of explanted dorsal root ganglia with brain-derived neurotrophic factor prevented the initial rise in accelerated and enhanced c-fos but did not alter c-jun and jund immunoreactivity of atf-2 declined or disappeared in those dorsal root ganglia compartments that showed a rise in c-jun and transferase dutp nick these findings demonstrate that inducible transcription factors such as jun and fos proteins are differentially expressed in adult neurons in vitro when compared to pathophysiological conditions in vivo such as nerve fibre transection (axotomy or the comparison between the explantation and culture experiments suggests that it is the complete axotomy of neurons that provokes those expression patterns found in neuronal cultures of adult the rapid and persisting expression of c-jun during neurite extension and apoptosis points at the activation of a pivotal program that might be determined by the presence or absence of atf-2 and that is involved in regeneration or
nerve-induced release of nitric oxide exerts dual effects on nicotinic transmission within the coeliac ganglion in the the involvement of nitric oxide in the modulation of nicotinic activation was investigated in vitro in isolated rabbit coeliac the electrical activity of the ganglionic neurons was recorded using intracellular recording when a train of pulses of supramaximum intensity was applied to the splanchnic gradual depression of fast nicotinic activation the pulses do not systematically elicit action but very often elicit excitatory postsynaptic potentials this phenomenon appeared between 15 and 20 hz and increased with the frequency of it was not related to any change in the membrane potential of the ganglionic for a given the depression appeared progressively and it was particularly strong at the end of the the use of pharmacological agents that interfere with the nitric oxide such as l-arginine (precursor of nitric d-arginine (non-precursor of nitric oxide) n(omega_-nitro-l-arginine and n(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (inhibitors of nitric oxide and (nitric oxide demonstrated that nitric oxide modulated this depression phenomenon by exerting a dual effect on the nicotinic facilitation or agents interfering with the guanosine monophosphate such as quinoxalin-1-one (selective inhibitor of the nitric oxide-activated soluble guanylate cyclase) and zaprinast (selective inhibitor of the phosphodiesterases involved in the guanosine monophosphate pathway) demonstrated that only the facilitatory effect of nitric oxide on the nicotinic activation was mediated through the guanosine monophosphate the mechanism sustaining the inhibitory effect remains to be by modulating the nicotinic nitric oxide plays a role in the integrative properties of the prevertebral this opens new perspectives with regard to the control of visceral functions by the prevertebral level of

morphometric aspects of the submucous plexus in whole-mount preparations of normal human distal the diagnosis of intestinal neuronal dysplasia (ind) has traditionally been based on the finding of hyperplasia of the submucous plexus and increased acetylcholinesterase activity in parasympathetic nerve fibers in the lamina recently it has been suggested that proposed diagnostic criteria relating to nerve cell density may overlap with age-related changes and that the finding of giant ganglia (ganglia containing more than seven ganglion cells) is the most relevant diagnostic parameter of ganglion cell counting is usually performed on conventional histological whereas the topology of whole ganglia has been poorly the aim of this study was to define the number of ganglion cells per ganglion and the ganglion cell density (the number of ganglion cells per surface area) in submucous whole-mount preparations of normal human specimens from distal colon were obtained during postmortem examination from 14 patients who died of nongastrointestinal the submucous layer was prepared as a whole mount and stained for nadph diaphorase (a nitrergic neurotransmitter marker) and cuprolinic blue (a general neuronal ganglion cell density was estimated by counting at least 10 the number of ganglion cells per ganglion was counted in at least 20 ganglia per ganglion cell density (nadph diaphorase) fell markedly during the first 5 to 6 years of life (r = p < most ganglion cells formed ganglia of 3 to 64 cuprolinic blue staining the mean number of ganglion cells per ganglion did not vary with the density of nadph diaphorase-positive ganglion cells in the submucous plexus of human distal colon decreases markedly with the number of ganglion cells per ganglion remains these findings indicate that the age of the patient has crucial importance for the histolopathologic evaluation of enteric nervous system
chemoafferent degeneration and carotid body hypoplasia following chronic hyperoxia in newborn to define the role of environmental oxygen in regulating postnatal maturation of the carotid body afferent light and electron microscopic methods were used to compare chemoafferent neurone survival and carotid body development in newborn rats reared from birth in normoxia (21 % o2) or chronic hyperoxia (60 % four weeks of chronic hyperoxia resulted in a significant 41 % decrease in the number of unmyelinated axons in the carotid sinus compared with age-matched normoxic in the number of myelinated axons was unaffected by hyperoxic chemoafferent located in the glossopharyngeal petrosal already exhibited degenerative changes following 1 week of hyperoxia from indicating that even a relatively short hyperoxic exposure was sufficient to derange normal chemoafferent in no such changes were observed in the vagal nodose demonstrating that the effect of high oxygen levels was specific to sensory neurones in the carotid body afferent petrosal ganglion neurones were sensitive to hyperoxic exposure only during the early postnatal chemoafferent degeneration in chronically hyperoxic animals was accompanied by marked hypoplasia of the carotid in view of previous findings from our laboratory that chemoafferent neurones require trophic support from the carotid body for survival after we propose that chemoafferent degeneration following chronic hyperoxia is due specifically to the loss of target tissue in the carotid
early specification of striatal projection neurons and interneuronal subtypes in the lateral and medial ganglionic the striatum is thought to be generated from two transient swellings in the ventral the lateral and medial ganglionic present at mid-stages of embryonic rat we have studied the relative contribution of these structures to the specific generation of striatal neuronal subtypes such as projection neurons and cholinergic and somatostatin-containing interneurons at an early stage and a mid stage in striatal dissociated progenitors isolated from the embryonic day and embryonic day rat lateral ganglionic eminence grafted into the previously ibotenic acid lesioned adult produce grafts containing extensive numbers of neurons expressing messenger rna for the striatal projection neuron whereas grafts of the embryonic day and embryonic day medial ganglionic eminences do while preprosomatostatin messenger rna-expressing neurons were observed in grafts from each of the lateral ganglionic eminence and medial ganglionic eminence at both embryonic day and embryonic day choline acetyltransferase messenger rna-expressing cholinergic neurons were largely found in grafts derived from the embryonic day medial ganglionic these results suggest that the neuronal diversity of the adult striatum may derive both from the lateral ganglionic providing darpp-32-expressing projection neurons as well as somatostatin-containing and the early stage medial ganglionic eminence specifically contributing the cholinergic

food restriction attenuates the blood pressure response to paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei lesions in aortic coarctation chronic food restriction reduces blood pressure (bp) and sympathetic support of bp in aortic coarctation the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that chronic food restriction would reduce sympathetic support of bp mediated by the paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei hypertension was induced in male sprague-dawley rats (n=40) by suprarenal aortic rats were assigned to either an ad libitum fed (al) group or a food restricted (fr) group that received 60% of the food consumed by al for 3 one week prior to data catheters were implanted in the left carotid artery and right jugular bp was measured for 2 days prior and 7 days after rats in al and fr groups received either bilateral electrolytic lesions of the pvn (pvnx) or sham lesions prior to either pvnx or fr rats had significantly lower bp fr=113+/-2 less of a depressor response to ganglionic blockade fr=-35+/-2 and lower plasma norepinephrine levels fr=380+/-23 pg/ml) compared to pvnx reduced bp in both al and fr rats (al-pvnx=105+/-6 fr-pvnx=101+/-3 pvnx also lowered the depressor response to ganglionic blockade (al-pvnx=-28+/-5 fr-pvnx=-29+/-4 mmhg) and plasma norepinephrine levels (al-pvnx=372+/-74 fr-pvnx=248+/-31 fr decreased the magnitude of the reductions in resting bp and in sympathetic activity in response to these results indicate that intact pvn are required for maintenance of aortic coarctation and implicate the pvn as a site involved in bp reductions produced by chronic food copyright 1998 elsevier science
suppression of fibroblast growth factor 2 expression by antisense oligonucleotides inhibits embryonic chick neural retina cell differentiation and survival in during retinal fibroblast growth factor 2 (fgf2) expression increases in retinal neurons following the sequential appearance of the neuronal the function of the developmental increase of endogenous fgf2 in the developing chick retina was investigated by using an antisense using both optic vesicle cultures and in ovo-intravitreal the former model allowed us to study the consequences of fgf2 down-regulation on early ganglion cell in the latter subsequent development stages and terminal maturation of the retina were fgf2 inhibition resulted in reduced ganglion cell as visualized by the expression of the ganglion cell-specific ra4 and islet-1 markers in optic vesicle eyes intravitreally injected with the fgf2-specific antisense oligonucleotide exhibited profound retinal differentiation thinning of the ganglion and outer nuclear (photoreceptors) cell layers and increased cell death in ganglion cell and inner nuclear these results indicate that the loss of endogenous fgf2 cannot be compensated for in the retina and suggest although many other sources of fgf exist in the the main role of the increase in endogenous fgf2 observed during retinal development is to intrinsically stimulate neuron differentiation and to protect neurons against cell
combined nicotinic and muscarinic blockade in elderly normal and physiologic establishing a pharmacologic model of the memory deficits of disease could be an important tool in understanding how memory we examined the combined effects of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine and the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine in eight normal elderly volunteers (age +/- each received four separate drug challenges (scopolamine mg mecamylamine mg/kg up to 15 mg mecamylamine + and there was a trend toward increased impairment in explicit memory for the mecamylamine + scopolamine condition as compared to scopolamine increased impairment was also seen for the mecamylamine + scopolamine condition as compared to scopolamine alone in selected behavioral pupil size increased when mecamylamine was added to while systolic blood pressure and pulse changed in concordance with ganglionic these data together with previous brain-imaging results suggest that this muscarinic-nicotinic drug combination may better model disease than either drug
transmitter identification in neurons involved in male copulation behavior in lymnaea in this we have mapped the cellular localization of various transmitters onto the central neurons which are involved in male copulation behavior in lymnaea by combining retrograde tracing with immunocytochemistry and in situ evidence is provided that neurons which were backfilled from the penis the sole nerve to innervate the male copulatory synthesize a multitude of neuropeptides lymnaea neuropeptide tyrosin pedal and lymnaea inhibitory peptide [lip]) as well as the classical in the anterior the backfilled neurons mainly contain the tetrapeptide apgwamide and and not lnpy or pedal the results suggest a central role in the regulation of copulation activity for the anterior lobe neurons that produce apgwamide and immunostainings of backfilled nervous systems revealed immunopositive axons originating from these neurons to form varicosities on the cell somata of neurons in the other clusters contributing to the innervation of the male sexual neurons from the right parietal ganglion projecting into the penis nerve were electrophysiologically and morphologically identified by simultaneously recording from the cell body intracellularly and the penis nerve extracellularly and subsequently filling them with an anterograde tracer and subjecting them to this method has provided links between and the transmitter contents of these
requirement for brn-3b in early differentiation of postmitotic retinal ganglion cell the brn-3 subfamily of pou domain transcription factors consists of and which are important regulators for sensorineural despite the expression of all three factors in retinal ganglion earlier studies have shown that brn-3b is the only one among the three brn-3 genes that is essential for development of approximately 70% of ganglion cells in the murine i report here that brn-3b displays a spatiotemporal expression pattern characteristic of the dynamic profile of ganglion cell genesis during murine retinal it is initially turned on in postmitotic ganglion cell precursors 2 days before the onset of brn-3a and -3c expression in differentiated ganglion during the entire period of retinal ganglion cell the postmitotic ganglion cell precursors that would normally become brn-3b+ cells fail to properly differentiate in brn-3b-/- as evidenced by a twofold reduction in the optic nerve size and diminished expression of several ganglion cell the undifferentiated ganglion cell precursors appear to be degenerated by apoptosis within the ganglion cell layer during the perinatal and early postnatal i propose that retinal ganglion cells develop following two separate differentiation pathways--brn-3b dependent and brn-3b in the brn-3b-dependent brn-3b may be required to initiate a particular differentiation program for a large set of postmitotic ganglion precursors to properly differentiate into the brn-3b-dependent retinal ganglion

basal ganglia precursors found in aggregates following embryonic transplantation adopt a striatal phenotype in heterotopic transplantation of immature cns-derived cells into the developing brain is a powerful approach to investigate the factors that regulate neuronal position and cns progenitor cells dissociated from the embryonic striatum and implanted into the brain of embryos of the same species generate cells that reaggregate to form easily recognizable structures that we previously called clusters and cells that disperse and integrate as single cells into the host we sought to determine if the neurons in the clusters differentiate according to their final location or acquire a striatal phenotype in heterotopic we transplanted dissociated cells from the e14 rat medial and lateral ganglionic either combined or in into the e16 embryonic rat at all time we found clusters of brdu- and dii-labelled donor cells located in the forebrain and without any apparent preference for immunocytochemical analyses revealed that cells in the clusters expressed darpp-32 and two antigens typically co-expressed in striatal medium-sized spiny in agreement with observations previously noted by several isolated cells integrated into heterologous host areas do not express basal ganglia these data imply that immature striatal neuronal progenitors exert a community effect on each other that is permissive and/or instructive for development of a striatal phenotype in heterotopic

programmed cell death in the mouse cochleovestibular ganglion during programmed cell death (pcd) is as essential to development as is cell our objective was to elucidate the spatiotemporal occurrence of pcd during the development of the cochleovestibular we performed a time-sequence study on the distribution of in situ during the development of the mouse cochleovestibular ganglion by using the tunel method to detect apoptosis apoptosis in the cochleovestibular ganglion was observed from the gestational day (gd) to the 5th apoptosis was seen most extensively in the vestibular ganglion cells at the while in the spiral ganglion cells apoptosis was maximal between the and because these times of peak apoptotic activity almost exactly corresponded to the events of innervation and terminal mitosis of the cochleovestibular ganglion we infer that pcd is involved in the innervation and modulates the number of cochleovestibular ganglion cells overproduced by terminal

expression of fos protein in the rat central nervous system in response to noxious effects of chronic inflammation of the superior cervical the aim of this study was to investigate the possible interactions between the nociceptive the sympathetic system and the inflammatory the superior cervical ganglion of rats was submitted to chronic inflammation and fos expression was used as a marker for neuronal activity throughout central neurons following painful peripheral the painful stimulus consisted of subcutaneously injected formalin applied to the supra-ocular fos-positive neurons were identified by conventional immunohistochemical and analyzed from the obex through the cervical levels of the spinal in the caudal sub-nucleus of the spinal trigeminal nuclear the number of fos-positive neurons was much higher in rats with inflammation of the superior cervical ganglion than in control either sham-operated or with saline applied to the there was a highly significant difference in the density of fos-positive neurons between the inflamed and control no significant difference was found between control these results suggest that the inflammation of the superior cervical ganglion generated an increased responsiveness to painful which may have been due to a diminished sympathetic influence upon the sensory peripheral
ca2+ and k+ currents regulate accommodation and firing frequency in guinea pig bronchial ganglion intracellular microelectrode recordings were obtained from neurons located in adult guinea pig bronchial parasympathetic ganglia in situ to determine the calcium and potassium currents regulating repetitive action potential activity and firing rates by these neurons in these ganglia respond to prolonged suprathreshold depolarizing current steps with either a burst of action potentials at the onset of the stimulus (accommodating or phasic neurons) or repetitive action potentials throughout the stimulus (nonaccommodating or tonic instantaneous and adapted firing rates during prolonged threshold and suprathreshold stimuli were lower in tonic than in phasic indicating a longer interspike interval between repetitive action potentials in tonic in tonic blockade of a-type current with 4-aminopyridine increased 4-aminopyridine or apamin decreased the interspike interval in tonic calcium-free cadmium or omega-conotoxin gvia also increased accommodation in tonic neurons but did not affect the interspike nifedipine or verapamil did not affect the tonic firing accommodation in phasic neurons could be decreased by a conditioning hyperpolarization step of the resting which could be subsequently blocked by 4-aminopyridine or calcium-free accommodation in phasic neurons could also be decreased by apamin or barium the repetitive action potentials observed during these treatments could be reversed by cadmium ions or calcium-free these results indicate that tonic and phasic neurons in guinea pig bronchial parasympathetic ganglia have similar types of calcium but potassium channels may ultimately regulate the accommodation the firing the output from these
differences in sympathetic innervation of mouse drg following proximal or distal nerve nerve injury leads to novel sympathetic innervation of the dorsal root ganglion we have hypothesized previously that the degenerating nerve increases the sympathetic sprouting in the drg and pain after chronic sciatic constriction injury (cci) by virtue of its influence on sensory and sympathetic axons spared by the l5 spinal nerve ligation and transection (snl) results in the complete isolation of the l5 drg from the degenerating yet sympathetic axons invade the and sympathetically dependent pain we investigated the role of wallerian degeneration in both sympathetic sprouting and neuropathic pain in these two models of painful peripheral neuropathy by comparing responses of normal c57b1/6j and c57b1/wlds mice in which degeneration is after wlds unlike 6j did not develop thermal or mechanoallodynia or sympathetic innervation of the l5 after both strains developed mechanoallodynia and sympathetic sprouts in but only 6j mice developed thermal observation of the origins of the invading sympathetic axons revealed that after sympathetics innervating blood vessels and dura (probably intact) sprouted into the but after snl sympathetics (probably axotomized) invaded from the injured spinal based on these we hypothesize that there are two mechanisms for sympathetic sprouting into differentially dependent on wallerian analysis of pain behavior in these animals reveals that (i) mechanoallodynia and sympathetic innervation of the drg tend to coincide and (ii) thermal allodynia and wallerian but not sympathetic innervation of the drg tend to copyright 1998 academic

differential fasciculation of follicular nerves for transferring specifically localized cues of the vibrissa rudiments to the central trigeminal sensory system in as exploited with dii and dia vibrissa connections play a decisive role in setting the somatotopic coordinates in the trigeminal sensory although previous studies have examined the development of peripheral certain questions are still in for the way vibrissa connections are and the relationship between periphery and central and ganglion cell in order to fill the blanks left by previous the extension of ganglionic branches and the formation of vibrissa connections were reexamined by using fluorescent carbocyanin dii and during embryonic days 10 to 14 in whole-mount preparations satisfactorily demonstrated the ganglionic fiber which allowed detailed analysis at both macroscopic and microscopic we show here that the differential fasciculation of follicular nerves is the critical process for organizing vibrissa connections which modulate the initially extending fiber follicular nerves developed by fine fibers arising from initially ordered root so as to connect with vibrissa rudiments that developed on the facial during differential ganglion cells were segregated into distinct groups by the vibrissa whereas central fiber terminals did not yet develop specific structures in the nuclear in the primary order of the trigeminal sensory vibrissa connections in the periphery were organized before those of the central these results indicate that trigeminal ganglion cells have a critical binomial function in order to transfer the somatotopic relations among vibrissa rudiments into the topographic coordinates of the central
organization of intrinsic cholinergic neurons projecting within submucosal plexus of guinea pig electrophysiological techniques were employed to examine the organization of the projections of submucosal neurons in the submucosal plexus of guinea pig these neurons were activated by focal pressure-pulse application of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) to single ganglia in submucosal preparations in and resulting fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (epsps) were recorded intracellularly in s-type 5-ht-evoked fast epsps were blocked by and ics-205-930 5-ht was applied either directly to the ganglion containing the neuron recorded intracellularly or to adjacent ganglia positioned at increasing distances on either side of the impaled cell in circumferential or longitudinal all s-type neurons recorded in this study (n = 103) received nicotinic fast epsps from cholinergic neurons when 5-ht was applied directly to the ganglion containing the impaled stimulation of adjacent ganglia also evoked nicotinic fast but the number of neurons that received this input decreased as the distance between the stimulus and the impaled cell maximal projections were 3 mm in the circumferential and orad-to-aborad there were no significant projections in the aborad-to-orad these findings suggest that s-type neurons in the submucosal plexus are innervated by intrinsic cholinergic neurons that project over relatively short distances and have a distinct orad-to-aborad

focal delivery of fibroblast growth factor-1 by transfected cells induces spiral ganglion neurite targeting in sensory cells in the cochlea of the rat transiently express acidic fibroblast growth factor (fgf-1) during the developmental period of terminal innervation in the sensory to explore the potential role of fgf-1 in terminal innervation the response of cochlear ganglion neurons to fgf-1 was evaluated in explants from the spiral ganglion of postnatal day 5 rats were cultured in the presence of exogenous with or without fgf-1 in the culture medium produced a dose-dependent increase in the number and length of neurites produced by spiral ganglion a response that was enhanced by to assess the effects of fgf-1 produced by a cellular additional explants were cocultured with 3t3 cell transfectants that secrete neurites that came into contact with fgf-1 secreting cells formed bouton-like terminal swellings on the surface of the and stopped the results suggest that fgf-1 may stimulate neurite extension into the sensory epithelium of the cochlea and that focal production of fgf-1 may contribute to the formation of contacts on sensory cells by developing
expression of the head gene lox22-otx in the leech helobdella and the origin of the bilaterian body the orthodenticle orthologue lox22-otx was isolated from an annelid the leech helobdella in situ hybridization reveals that embryonic expression of lox22-otx rna is primarily restricted to an unsegmented head including tissues in the surface and the head ganglion of the central nervous the patterns of head expression form concentric rings about the stomadeum and mark tissue domains that exhibit discrete behaviors during later morphogenesis and expression was also observed in one to two bilateral pairs of neurons in each segmental ganglion or neuromere of the body the largely head-specific expression of lox22-otx in this annelid species supports data from two other bilaterian phyla in suggesting the existence of a genetically defined head/trunk we suggest here that this head/trunk distinction is a synapomorphy of the bilateria as a and that it reflects the body plan of an early bilaterian in we discuss the possibility that the radial organization of gene expression and cell lineages in the head domain may reflect the symmetry properties of a prebilaterian ancestor that had a radially symmetric body copyright 1998 academic
