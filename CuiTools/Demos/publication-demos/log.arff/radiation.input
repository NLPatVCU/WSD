a comparison of intracavitary versus interstitial irradiation in the treatment of cervical management of locally advanced cervical cancer consists primarily of combination external and internal in order to investigate the impact of intracavitary brachytherapy versus interstitial brachytherapy on local tumor and we retrospectively reviewed the concomitant experience of two each of which practice exclusively one of these radiotherapeutic between 1979 and 61 patients with bulky stage or iva cervical cancer were treated using a combination of teletherapy and intracavitary brachytherapy at one while 70 similar patients were treated with teletherapy and interstitial brachytherapy at another patients in both groups were similar with respect to figo tumor surgical and histologic patients treated with intracavitary therapy received a mean cumulative dose of 7706 cgy to point a and 5523 cgy to point b using standard fletcher-suit those who received interstitial irradiation were treated with a mean external dose of 5050 cgy and 2 interstitial implants using a transperineal syed-neblett template with a mean tumor dose of 2239 and cgy with each patients treated with chemoradiation were excluded from this although initial rates of local control were not prolonged 5-year disease-free survival (50% vs p = and improved 5-year local control (61% vs p = were observed among patients with stage ii disease treated with intracavitary no statistical differences in survival could be detected among stage iii and iva women treated with intracavitary irradiation received a larger dose of brachytherapy than those treated with interstitial therapy (4608 vs 3504 radium milligram hours p < because a tandem was only used in 17 (24%) interstitial major complications occurred in 21% of patients in each when a tandem is infrequently used during interstitial the toxicity is similar to that of intracavitary more relapses are observed among patients with stage ii lesions treated with interstitial
radiobiological considerations in magna-field radiobiological considerations are described for total body irradiation (tbi) as given to patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation although much progress has been made in the use of bmt for refractory many patients still die from interstitial pneumonia and fractionated tbi has been introduced in order to improve leukemic cell while increasing the degree of normal tissue bone marrow stem leukemic cells and immunocytes have been considered as having a limited ability to repair radiation damage while cells of lung tissue and intestinal epithelial cells have a greater during fractionated radiation therapy or continuous low-dose rate repair of sublethal damage between fractions allows greater recovery in the cell of lung tissue compared to those in the bone the potential benefit of six fractions over one fraction or low dose-rate tbi has yet to be although there is suggestive evidence for a reduced incidence of interstitial other extraneous factors such as doses to the differences in conditioning effect of increased delay in bmt for patients receiving fractionated and the unmeasurable differences between insitutions make definite conclusions despite a consenus for dose fractionation has developed and most centers are moving away from the use of large single dose
chromosome telomere capture and mechanisms of radiation-induced chromosome it is generally assumed that radiation-induced chromosome breaks are the result of a inability to rejoin dna double-strand breaks but the exact mechanisms underlying the failure to rejoin some dsb and the conversion of these lesions into chromosome breaks are poorly understood at it has been speculated that the conversion of dsb into chromosome following exposure of mammalian cells to ionizing may be mediated by the enzyme telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that has two distinct to replicate pre-existing chromosome ends (telomeres) and to heal broken chromosomes by de novo addition of telomeric sequences directly on to non-telomeric dsb may be converted into chromosome breaks by a telomerase-independent mechanism termed telomere to review telomere biology and to examine the significance of chromosome healing and telomere capture mechanisms tor radiation the currently available literature suggests that telomere capture may be a more frequent mechanism for stabilization of broken chromosomes in mammalian cells than telomerase-mediated chromosome a definitive conclusion must await improvements in the resolution of molecular cytogenetic techniques to a degree which allows telomerase products to be clearly distinguishable from subtelomeric cryptic translocations indicative of telomere
a-bomb detection of bias in the life span study by drawing a distinction between a-bomb survivors with and without bomb-related it was possible to see that instead of the life span study (lss) cohort being a homogenous there were significant differences between survivors with and without multiple and that these differences occurred largely among survivors who were under 10 or over 50 years of age when there also was a concentration of a-bomb-related injuries among survivors who eventually developed so it is possible that deaths before 1950 had left the lss cohort permanently biased in favor of persons who had high levels of resistance to all (early and late) effects of it is also possible that the high proportion of leukemia cases among the deaths of a-bomb survivors from 1950 to 1970 were because the radiation caused an initial leukocytosis followed by loss of immunologic

modest decline in late mortality following disease in the southeastern netherlands since since prolonged remission can be induced in the majority of patients with disease treatment-related mortality and morbidity have we investigated whether awareness of toxicity diminished treatment-related mortality for unselected patients treated between 1972 and 1993 in general hospitals in the southeastern we also estimated the prevalence of treatment-related morbidity among patients treated in the data were collected on all 345 hd patients registered in the eindhoven cancer registry between 1972 and medical records and histology were follow-up ended in administration of mopp chemotherapy and there was a shift from total nodal irradiation to less extended low-dose for cured patients the 10-year relative survival improved from 84% in the 1970s to 90% in the which is reflected by a decline in excess mortality from 16% to the 10-year relative mortality risk due to secondary malignancies decreased from (95% to (ci which is also reflected by a decline in the 10-year cumulative incidence for all cancers from 10% to the relative risk of late cardiovascular which is closely related to previous barely as shown by a decrease from (ci to hd survivors profited less from the sharp decline in cardiovascular mortality observed for the general among the prevalence of serious treatment-related morbidity 5 years or more after initial diagnosis was in modest decline in excess mortality among cured hd patients was observed in the as reflected by a decrease in mortality due to second late especially due to radiation-related cardiovascular is still about one third of hd survivors suffer radiation-induced clinical trials to find ways to minimize iatrogenic complications are
characterization of whole genome radiation hybrid mapping resources for non-mammalian radiation hybrid panels are already available for genome mapping in human and in this study we have used two model organisms (chicken and zebrafish) to show that hybrid panels that contain a full complement of the donor genome can be generated by fusion to hamster the quality of the resulting hybrids has been assessed using pcr and we confirmed the utility of our panels by establishing the percentage of donor dna present in the our hybrid resources will allow inexpensive gene mapping and we expect that this technology can be transferred to many other such successes are providing the basis for a new era of mapping in the form of whole genome radiation hybrid and are opening new possibilities for systematic genome analysis in the animal genetics
genetic mapping of soluble guanylyl cyclase implications for linkage to blood pressure in the dahl the nitric oxide (no) signaling consisting of no soluble guanylyl and plays a prominent role in salt handling and regulation of blood soluble guanylyl cyclases are heme-containing heterodimers the alpha1/beta1 isoform has greater no sensitivity than the it has recently been shown that expression of the beta subunits is altered in the kidney of the dahl salt-sensitive the beta1 subunit is decreased and the beta2 subunit whether soluble guanylyl cyclase is linked to salt sensitivity is not in the present we investigated linkage of guanylyl cyclase genes to blood alpha1 and beta1 gene loci for soluble guanylyl cyclase were mapped to rat chromosome and the beta2 gene locus was mapped to rat chromosome 5 using fluorescent in situ metaphase by use of a rat radiation hybrid the gene loci were then further mapped with respect to known quantitative trait locus markers of salt-sensitive hypertension in the dahl rat on chromosomes 2 and genes for alpha1 and beta1 were closely linked by two-point analysis to alpha1 isoform (lod of and respectively) and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii-delta loci (lod of and which have been previously shown to flank a quantitative trait locus for blood pressure in the dahl the alpha1 and beta1 genes were closely linked (lod of the beta2 gene locus was closely linked to the endothelin-2 (et-2) locus (lod of which has been shown to cosegregate with blood we conclude that soluble guanylyl cyclase subunit and are good candidates for genes controlling salt-sensitive hypertension in the dahl
apoptotic repair of genotoxic tissue damage and the role of p53 the spontaneous mutation rate per replication per genome is nearly invariant in the rate of spontaneous genomic mutations in higher eukaryotes is much the mutation rates per locus per generation among mice and humans are despite the large differences in generation a simple explanation for these findings is that mice and humans have a specific antimutagenic mechanism that is lacking in i propose that apoptotic repair-deletion of genotoxic damage-bearing cells-operates in mammalian germ cells and that it works more accurately in humans than in mice because of a slower rate of cell turnover and a longer generation it has been a long-standing puzzle that germline mutation frequencies decrease markedly as the dose-rate of radiation is lowered in mice but not in this can be readily explained by p53-dependent apoptotic because the p53 gene is absent from the genome of fetuses of p53+/+ mice have proficient apoptotic repair capacity for x-ray-induced teratogenic but p53-null fetuses completely lack this i propose that the primary role of the p53 gene is to guard germ cells and embryos from genotoxic this implies that the tumour suppressor function of the p53 gene results from p53-dependent apoptotic deletion of cells with genotoxic the reasoning behind this proposal is given by reviewing reports that drosophila larvae are insensitive to tumour formation after i discuss the genetic effects of radiation in copyright 1998 elsevier science all rights
the influence of pre-radiation salivary flow rates and radiation dose on parotid salivary gland dysfunction in patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck radiotherapy (rt) used for head and neck cancers causes permanent salivary gland dysfunction previous short-term studies have demonstrated that pre-rt salivary flow rates and the amount of radiation exposure to parotid glands influence the amount of rt-induced the purpose of this study was to determine which variables are related to the development of long-term post-rt parotid flow rates (pfr) were assessed prior to and 1 year after completion of rt in spared parotid glands from 34 patients from 2 parotid-sparing the results reveal that spared pfr were not significantly higher 1 year post-rt in patients who had high pre-rt when compared with patients with low pre-rt patients who received higher doses of rt to spared parotid glands had lower pfr 1 year compared with patients who had received lower doses of these one-year findings suggest that high pre-rt pfr do not provide protection against rt-induced reduced rt dosages to contralateral parotid glands are protective of pfr after completion of
x-radiation induces formation in vivo in rat mammary gland ionizing radiation is a carcinogen that induces oxidative dna (8-ohdg) is a relatively mutagenic lesion that is widely regarded as a reliable index of oxidative dna the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of x-radiation on levels of 8-ohdg in the context of an experimental model for breast cancer in which chronic radiation exposure has been shown to be carcinogenic in sprague-dawley a secondary objective of this study was to determine if the use of phenol during dna isolation affected the concentration of 8-ohdg subsequently our results indicate that a profoundly carcinogenic dose of radiation induced a small but significant increase in 8-ohdg concentration in mammary gland and that the use of a phenol-based versus a salt-based method of dna isolation had no significant impact on the levels of 8-ohdg detected in either control or irradiated
modulation of radiation-induced strand break repair by cisplatin in mammalian to investigate the repair of ionizing radiation-induced dna lesions in human skin fibroblasts in the presence of cisplatin-dna adducts and to determine the persistence of dna repair inhibition by materials and normal human fibroblasts (ag 1522) treated with cisplatin were exposed to 4 gy 60co gamma-radiation and assayed for repair of radiation-induced damage under growth-permissive dna damage was measured by the fluorescence analysis of dna unwinding (fadu) and cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus rejoining of strand breaks caused by 4 gy radiation in cells without cisplatin pre-treatment appeared to be biphasic with an initial fast component (up to 15 min of repair time) followed by a slower and was completed by 90 cisplatin treatment (10 30 min) immediately before irradiation had no effect on the fast rejoining but inhibited the slow component the same cisplatin treatment 24 h prior to irradiation inhibited both slow and fast components in decreasing the cisplatin exposure to microg/ml for 30 24h prior to resulted in an increased amount of strand break repair at each time point measured compared with irradiated control this mild cisplatin treatment (95% survival) also resulted in a reduction of radiation-generated micronuclei indicating an adaptive cisplatin used in combination with ionizing radiation can produce differential cellular responses depending upon the severity of the cisplatin treatment and the time interval between cisplatin and radiation
flow cytometry measurements of subsets of b and nk cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes of atomic bomb previous studies of blood cells from atomic bomb survivors have shown that frequencies of chromosome aberrations and somatic mutations are elevated in heavily exposed survivors and that t-cell functions and the number of mature t cells are decreased in the survivors who were exposed to radiation as current progress in flow cytometry allows a sophisticated analysis of various subsets of b and nk in the present proportions of such subsets in peripheral blood lymphocytes from atomic bomb survivors (159 survivors estimated to be exposed to > or gy) and 252 controls were measured using multiple combinations of monoclonal antibodies to lymphocyte differentiation antigens to investigate whether the previous radiation exposure had altered the composition of the among t-cell the proportion of cd4+ t-cell subsets was decreased significantly in the heavily exposed this tendency was apparent for the cd4+cd45ra+ naive t-cell there were no significant differences in the proportions of cd8+ t-cell subsets between the exposed survivors and as for the b-cell the proportion of both cd5+ and cd5 b cells as well as cd23+ and cd23- b cells increased in the heavily exposed no effect of radiation was found in the proportion of nk-cell these results strongly suggest that previous radiation exposure altered the composition of t and b cells in the peripheral blood of atomic bomb and they raise the possibility that atomic bomb radiation may have affected the developmental processes of t and b
[the characteristics of the bone marrow stromal elements in the participants in the cleanup of the aftermath of the accident at the chernobyl atomic electric power station in the long histologic features were studied of bone marrow biopsies in 25 individuals who took part in the elimination of the aftermath of the chernobyl accident and who had received a radiation dose of at least 1 particular features of the studied trepanobiopsies included dysplasia of hypocellular bone circulatory disorders and sinusoidal edematization of stromal substitution of fibroreticular tissue for hemopoietic no relationship was established between the changes revealed and radiation
knowledge and perception regarding radiotherapy and radiation in patients receiving a qualitative this study aimed to acquire information about the knowledge patients have about radiation and and the sources and impact of this data collection was by semi-structured interviews with 30 randomly selected adult patients conducted during the first half of a course of data analysis used three major understanding and sources of few interviewees had any idea of the physical characteristics of radiation or they found it difficult to knowledge about radiation other than for medical most commonly concerned the atom patients understood radiotherapy in terms of its action on almost all offered a sensible description of why radiotherapy was being used to treat their most talked about radiation attacking their cancer in some way and many worried about its damaging a third gave detailed information about what they had become aware of through the written or radio or the message taken from press reports was largely
combined preoperative radiation and mitomycin/5-fluorouracil treatment for locally advanced rectal in the treatment of locally advanced rectal radiation therapy before surgery has been shown to decrease local recurrence but has minimal effect on chemotherapy in combination with preoperative radiation therapy has been shown to be effective for certain we postulated that such combination therapy might improve the resectability of advanced rectal study during a 4-year period we treated 20 patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the rectum using a protocol of preoperative simultaneous pelvic irradiation cgy) and infusion chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil 100 mg/m2 per day over 96 hours and mitomycin 10 mg/m2) followed by surgical effects of therapy on tumor recurrence and and complications of treatment were minimal toxicity was observed and all patients completed their scheduled preoperative reduction in tumor size after as measured by ct averaged 61% (range twenty percent had a complete pathologic response to preoperative with no tumor found in the surgical using kaplan-meier survival the 5-year survival was estimated to be and cancer free and local pelvic control rates were 41+/-12% and 88+/-8% we believe that preoperative combination radiation and chemotherapy may provide significant benefit for patients with locally advanced rectal and that large scale studies of this treatment regimen are
astro research the role of bcl-2 and glutathione in an antioxidant pathway to prevent radiation-induced the expression of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene has been associated with resistance to radiation-induced there is evidence that the bcl-2 protein acts in an antioxidant pathway to block the effects of reactive oxygen species that mediate apoptosis possibly by increasing the levels of intracellular our hypothesis is that pretreatment of radiation-sensitive known to lack bcl-2 with antioxidants will reduce radiation-induced for this the apoptotic response to radiation and the intracellular levels of gsh were tested before and after pretreatment with antioxidants in two murine lymphoma cell a bcl-2- expressing (ly-ar) line and a non-bcl-2-expressing (ly-as) methods and ly-ar and ly-as cells were irradiated at and 4 hours before the intracellular levels of reduced (gsh) and oxidized (gssg) glutathione were determined by the use of the fluorescent dye ly-as cells were treated with gsh ethyl-ester for 1 and 2 hours after apoptotic response was measured by the dna fragmentation the radiation dose was after the apoptotic rate of ly-ar and ly-as cells was 10-20% and 50-70% ly-ar cells had higher intracellular gsh and gssg levels compared to ly-as cells by and respectively and the gsh/gssg ratio in ly-ar and ly-as cells was and gsh levels did not change during the first 2 hours after there was a 49% and 84% reduction at 3 and 4 hours after times at which the ly-as cells have already fragmented their treatment of ly-as cells with gsh ethyl-ester at a concentration of 7 mm for 1 and 2 hours resulted in 70% and 231% increases in the intracellular gsh levels treatment of ly-as cells with gsh ethyl-ester for 1 and 2 hours also conferred a 25-50% decrease in their apoptotic response after gsh and gssg levels are elevated in bcl-2-expressing murine lymphoma cells compared to non-bcl-2-expressing gsh levels decline only in radiation-sensitive cells after irradiation but this appears to occur at the time of apoptotic cell exogenous thiols increase intracellular gsh levels and repress radiation-induced in intracellular thiols appear to be involved in protecting cells from apoptotic cell further investigation should be directed in identifying substances which by lowering intracellular thiols may result in sensitization to
quantitative analysis of p53 protein in non-small cell lung cancer and its prognostic accumulation of mutant p53 protein occurs frequently in human including 40-60% of non-small cell lung the implications of such p53 usually assessed by immunohistochemical for the prognosis of lung cancer patients remain in this we used a time-resolved immunofluorometric assay to measure p53 protein concentrations in extracts prepared from 86 primary non-small cell lung tumours and examined the associations between p53 protein levels (corrected for total protein) and other clinico-pathologic including post-surgical disease-free and overall contingency tables analysed by chi2 tests revealed no significant relationships between p53 defined by a median cut-off and patient disease histologic grade and lymph node smoking history and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy or multivariate cox proportional hazard regression analysis demonstrated a dose-response relationship between p53 expressed as a quartile-divided and increased risk of relapse (p = and death (p = patients whose tumours contained p53 concentrations exceeding the median value had over 3-fold higher risk of relapse (p = and death (p = than those whose tumours had lower p53 we also provide evidence suggesting that the impact of p53 on survival is greater in patients with squamous cell carcinoma than in those with although the latter finding needs our results suggest that application of an immunoassay of p53 protein on non-small cell lung tumour extracts may identify patients at increased risk of unfavourable
