perceptions of effort and heaviness during fatigue and during the size-weight previous work has shown that force perception and the sense of motor effort are different attributes of sensorimotor this study explores the hypothesis that one reason force and effort perceptions are distinct is to inform an individual of impaired motor function when muscular force lags this hypothesis predicts that effort and force perceptions will dissociate when motor function is impaired by fatigue but not during the size-weight all subjects reported a distinct increase in effort when lifting a standard test weight as fatigue when fatigue was sufficiently marked so that they could barely lift the test they rated their effort as similar to that required to lift a maximal weight in the unfatigued the perceived heaviness of the test weight also increased as fatigue but this fatigue-weight illusion was smaller than the increase in effort for all subjects and displayed greater in both the perceived weight of a small object and the effort required to lift it increased in parallel when small and large objects were lifted the size-weight and size-effort illusions appear to be examples of a common phenomenon in which perceptual experience is rescaled to maintain acuity under different working the fatigue-weight illusion also has the effect of increasing perceptual acuity as the weight lifting range decreases due to
