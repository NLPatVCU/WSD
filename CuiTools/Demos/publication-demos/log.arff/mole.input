camp-dependent phosphorylation activates phosphofructokinase from mantle tissue of the mollusc mytilus identification of the phosphorylated phosphofructokinase from mantle tissue of the sea mussel mytilus galloprovincialis was phosphorylated in vitro by a protein kinase isolated from the same homologous to mammalian camp-dependent protein the maximal level of phosphorylation achieved was around 1 mol of pi/mol of phosphofructokinase the covalent incorporation of phosphate leads to a notable increase in the enzyme activity assayed at near-physiological concentrations of substrates and allosteric modulators and neutral tryptic digestion of labeled phosphofructokinase released a phosphopeptide whose sequence was this sequence showed high homology with the phosphopeptides from other invertebrates whose phosphofructokinase is also activated by camp-dependent
dsc studies of the conformational stability of barstar the temperature induced unfolding of barstar wild-type of bacillus amyloliquefaciens (90 residues) has been characterized by differential scanning the process has been found to be reversible in the ph range from to in the absence of it has been clearly shown by a ratio of delta hvh/delta hcal near 1 that denaturation follows a two-state for the c82a mutant was also this mutant exhibits similar but has a slightly lower transition the transition enthalpy of barstar wt (303 kj mol-1) exceeds that of the c82a mutant (276 kj mol-1) by approximately the heat capacity changes show a similar delta cp being +/- 1 kj mol-1 k-1 for the wild-type and +/- 1 kj mol-1 k-1 for the c82a the extrapolated stability parameters at 25 degrees c are delta g0 = +/- 2 kj mol-1 for barstar wt and delta g0 = +/- 2 kj mol-1 for the c82a
evidence for cell surface and internal phospholipase activity in ascidian upon ascidian eggs release a cell surface glycosidase used in the block to polyspermy and undergo cortical contractions resulting from increased intracellular calcium the glycosidase is released by calcium ionophores or added phospholipase c (plc) the plc inhibitor d609 blocks glycosidase intact ascidia ceratodes eggs cleave 4-methylumbelliferyl-phospho-choline when it is added to this yields highly fluorescent authentic phospholipase c but not phospholipase d can cleave this the authors believe that cleavage of the substrate is specific for plc eggs incubated in the fluorogenic substrate after having been washed and detergent extracted were not therefore the substrate failed to enter intact glycosidase release and plc activity were stimulated by octylglucoside or triton x-100 extracts of ascidian eggs had two forms of phospholipase activity as shown by ion affinity pl1 eluting at mol/l nacl and pl2 eluting at mol/l the pl1 appeared to be isolated as a single when surface proteins were labeled with non-penetrating biotin and were subsequently reacted with half of the plc activity this demonstrates that half the ascidian egg plc activity is located on the surface of either the egg or follicle and half is located within the
contractile responses of cultured bovine retinal pericytes to angiotensin to document that angiotensin (ang) ii contracts cultured bovine retinal pericytes via saralasin-sensitive receptors if the cells are changes in the contractile tone were quantified as the changes in the summed length of wrinkles induced by pericytes cultured on the silicone angiotensin ii (10(-5) mol/l) did not increase the contractile tone of cultured pericytes that were not when the pericytes had been prerelaxed 41% with 10(-6)-mol/l sodium ang ii at the range of 10(-7) to 10(-5) mol/l caused significant it induced a maximum contraction [mean+/-se]) at 10(-6) this effect lasted at least 10 angiotensin ii receptor antagonist saralasin (10(-6) mol/l) abolished the contractile effect of ang ii (10(-6) although by itself it did not affect the contractile angiotensin ii contracts cultured pericytes through saralasin-sensitive ang ii if ang ii affects the contractile tone of pericytes in it may affect capillary and blood
mechanisms of nitroso compound-induced inhibition of superoxide generation in fluorescence quenching of perylene by nitroso-compounds in the membrane fractions of to investigate the mechanism of nitroso compound-induced inhibition of the respiratory burst in we studied fluorescence quenching of perylene by nitroso-compounds in the membrane fractions of neutrophils at and 37 degrees c and the reagent-induced inhibition of superoxide generation at 28 and 37 degrees with increasing the quenching of perylene fluorescence and inhibition of superoxide generation by nitrosobenzene (nb) were both while those by 2-nitrosotoluene (nt) were both the temperature dependence of the inhibition constants and the quenching constants indicates that the binding of nb is exothermic (deltah= -27 kj/mol for inhibition and deltah= -29 kj/mol for quenching) and essentially on the other that of nt is endothermic (deltah= +16 kj/mol for inhibition and quenching) and essentially quenching studies of perylene fluorescence in synthetic vesicles made of endogenous polar lipids of neutrophils showed that the enthalpy changes of nb- and nt-binding with perylene in lipids were similar to each their values were in good agreement with that of but not of in the membrane an assembly of proteins and of these results suggest that nb inhibits the activity by binding to proteins in the whereas inhibition by nt occurs through hydrophobic interaction with lipids and/or
counter current transfer of beta-endorphin in the perihypophyseal cavernous sinus--carotid rete vascular complex of this study was performed to answer the question of whether counter current retrograde transfer of beta-endorphin in the perihypophyseal cavernous sinus-carotid rete vascular complex depends on the reproductive activity of sheep and if this transfer depends on membrane na+ k+ atp-ase blocking by sheep were anaesthetised and the jugular vein and the carotid artery were cannulated on both multielectrolitical liquids polfa 500 ml of solfin with heparin or solfin with heparin and ouabain usa) in concentrations of 10(-5) or 10(-4) mol 1(-1) were infused into the brain through the carotid heparinized blood was collected through the carotid after the head with the neck was the isolated head was supplied with autologous blood diluted with solfin without or with ouabain in concentration of 10(-5) or 10(-4) mol blood pressure and temperature were measured throughout the duration of the during the experiment 125i-beta-endorphin x 107 dpm) dissolved in 10 ml of solfin was infused for 5 min (5 ml) into each cavernous sinus through the angularis oculi blood samples for radioactivity measurements were collected each min from the carotid rete (through the opposite carotid artery to the artery supplying the brain with arterial blood) and from both jugular in all the experiments significant 125i-beta-endorphin radioactivity was found in arterial blood supplying the brain and hypophysis in the early luteal phase in no radioactivity was found (with the exception of one animal) in sheep during seasonal a blockage of na+ k+ atp-ase by ouabain administered during exsanguination and during head perfusion with dose of 10(-4) mol 1(-1) reduced beta-endorphin counter current transfer to arterial but this effect was not evident with the dose of 10(-5) mol increased blood pressure was observed in all the experiments with either dose of
purinergic transmitters inhibit bone formation by cultured adenosine triphosphate (atp) and other purinoceptor agonists cause a transient rise in [ca2+]i in cultured osteoblast-like cells and have a mitogenic as does parathyroid hormone and there is evidence that atp and pth can act synergistically on the likelihood that acting through are important local factors in bone remodeling is therefore their effect on bone formation is we recently developed a culture system in which appositional bone formation occurs only in narrow grooves cut in a we have used this as an assay to measure the effects of atp (50 and 500 atp gamma s (20 2-mesatp (2 and 20 uridine triphosphate (utp) and 20 adenosine (20 bovine pth and rat pth1-34 (10(-8) and 10(-7) and rat pthrp1-40 (10(-9) and 10(-8) mol/l) on bone formation by rat calvarial the culture medium was renewed 3 times/week (every 2 or 3 and the number of bone loci and length and area of alizarin red-stained mineralized bone formed in the grooves of each specimen in 16-29 days were compared with atp gamma and atp reduced the amount of bone formed in a 2-3 week culture adenosine had no and utp either had no effect or at 2 mumol/l stimulated bone pth and pthrp completely abolished bone formation in 4 week our findings are consistent with evidence for more than one p2 purinoceptor subtype in and show for the first time that the effect of atp on appositional bone formation by osteoblasts in vitro like pth and

human recombinant phosphodiesterase 4b2b binds (r)-rolipram at a single site with two the interactions between (r)-rolipram and purified human recombinant camp-specific phosphodiesterase (hspde4b2b) constructs were investigated using and biophysical the full-length protein (amino acids 1-564) and an n-terminal truncated protein (amino acids 81-564) exhibited high-affinity (r)-rolipram whereas an n-terminal and c-terminal truncated protein (amino acids 152-528) lacked high-affinity (r)-rolipram the 152-528 and 81-564 proteins had similar and and differed less than 4-fold compared with the 1-564 (r)-rolipram inhibition plots were biphasic for the 1-564 and 81-564 proteins and fit to two a high-affinity (ki = 5-10 nm) state and a low-affinity (ki = 200-400 nm) whereas the 152-528 protein fit to a single state (ki = 350-400 the stoichiometry for high-affinity binding using a filter binding assay was found to be <1 mol of (r)-rolipram per mole of 1-564 or 81-564 titration microcalorimetric studies revealed both a high-affinity state with a stoichiometry of mol of (r)-rolipram per mole of protein and a low-affinity state with a stoichiometry of mol of (r)-rolipram per mole of protein for the 81-564 a single low-affinity state with a stoichiometry of mol of (r)-rolipram per mole of protein was seen using the 152-528 the data indicate that purified hspde4b2b 1-564 and 81-564 proteins contain a single binding site for (r)-rolipram and suggest that the proteins exist in two different states distinguishable by their affinity for the high-affinity binding state of the protein requires amino acid residues at the n-terminus (81-151) of the protein and catalytic domain whereas the low-affinity binding state only requires residues in the catalytic domain phosphorylation at residues 487 and 489 of the 81-564 protein does not appear to alter the substrate kinetics or the stoichiometry and binding affinity of
the cholesterol dependence of activation and fast desensitization of the nicotinic acetylcholine when nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are reconstituted into lipid bilayers lacking agonists no longer stimulate cation the kinetics of this process are difficult to study because variations in vesicle morphology cause errors in flux we developed a new stopped-flow fluorescence assay to study activation independently of vesicle when receptors were rapidly mixed with agonist plus the earliest fluorescence increase reported the fraction of channels that opened and their apparent rate of fast these processes were absent when the receptor was reconstituted into dioleoylphosphatidylcholine or into a mixture of that lipid with dioleoylphosphatidic acid (12 even though a fluorescent agonist reported that resting-state receptors were still the agonist-induced channel opening probability increased with bilayer with a midpoint value of 9 +/- mol% and a hill coefficient of +/- reaching a plateau above 20-30 mol% cholesterol that was equal to the native on the other the observed fast desensitization rate was comparable to that for native membranes from the lowest cholesterol concentration examined (5 thus the ability to reach the open state after activation varies with the cholesterol concentration in the whereas the rate of the open state to fast desensitized state transition is the structural basis for this is but an interesting corollary is that the channels of newly synthesized receptors are not fully primed by cholesterol until they are inserted into the plasma membrane--a novel form of posttranslational
kinase-related protein (telokin) is phosphorylated by smooth-muscle myosin light-chain kinase and modulates the kinase telokin is an abundant smooth-muscle protein with an amino acid sequence identical with that of the c-terminal region of smooth-muscle myosin light-chain kinase although it is expressed as a separate protein [gallagher and herring (1991) here we demonstrate that telokin is also similar to smooth-muscle myosin regulatory light chain (relc) not only in its gross physical properties but also as an mlck telokin was slowly phosphorylated by mlck in the presence of ca2+ and calmodulin and could be readily dephosphorylated by myosin light-chain a threonine residue was phosphorylated with up to mol/mol this low together with the observed dimerization of telokin [sobieszek and nieznanski (1997) indicates that the telokin dimer was acting as the substrate with a single protomer being our enzyme kinetic analysis of the phosphorylation reaction confirms this because telokin phosphorylation also required micromolar concentrations of which also facilitates the formation of kinase we concluded that the oligomers are interacting with thus it seems that telokin modulates the phosphorylation rate of myosin filaments by a mechanism that includes the direct or indirect inhibition of the kinase active site by the telokin and that removal of the inhibition is controlled by slow phosphorylation of the telokin which results in mlck
oligomerization of the egf receptor transmembrane a 2h nmr study in lipid during the course of a previous study by wideline 2h we noted spectral features suggesting the possibility of monitoring homodimer/oligomer interactions between transmembrane domains of the egf receptor in lipid bilayers & (1996) biochemistry in the present work this possibility was explored using the 34-residue peptide the peptide sequence included the 23 amino acid hydrophobic stretch thought to span the membrane (ile622-met644 of the egf plus the first 10 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain selective deuteration was carried out at sites corresponding to and samples were studied from 12 to 65 degrees c by 2h nmr in fluid membranes having low peptide concentration (1 mol %) or high peptide concentration (6 mol methyl groups proved to be technically particularly attractive probe reversible homodimer/oligomer interactions were detected in membranes of the common natural phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine without effects on the egf receptor transmembrane domain included alterations in peptide backbone motional order and/or conformation at the site of ala623 within the and alterations in motional properties of the val650 side chain in the cytoplasmic there was little spectral evidence of stable oligomer formation except at the lowest temperature addition of 33% cholesterol to these membranes was accompanied by spectral changes consistent with the formation of more stable peptide and by evidence that peptide-peptide interactions were sensed at all three probe peptide-peptide interactions remained easily particularly at higher freeze-fracture electron microscopy of the nmr samples demonstrated peptide-related intramembranous particles traversing the to our this is the first electron microscopy description of receptor tyrosine kinases or their fragments in model in the presence of the peptide-related particles were generally more sharply and showed a tendency to these observations relate to models of receptor lateral association as an aspect of signal and to forces that may determine protein sorting and organization in cell we suggest that the cholesterol effects reflect a general phenomenon rather than one specific to the egf
complement mediates attenuation of endothelium-dependent relaxations in canine coronary arteries after porcine serum a mechanism for vascular thrombosis in xenograft hyperacute evidence for complement activation in xenograft hyperacute rejection includes prolongation of graft survival after complement inactivation as well as component deposition and consumption during hyperacute the current investigations examined the endothelial production of vasoactive substances during heterologous serum segments of canine coronary artery were exposed to either autologous canine serum for 90 minutes or heterologous porcine serum for or 90 after replacement of the serum with buffered segments were contracted with phenylephrine (10(-6) mol/l) in the presence of indomethacin (10(-5) compared with responses of vessels exposed to autologous canine receptor-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine was impaired in arteries after 60 or 90 minutes of exposure to porcine receptor-independent relaxation to calcium ionophore a23187 was not significantly impaired at any length of porcine serum endothelial-independent relaxation to sodium nitroprusside was not impaired with either canine or porcine serum oxyhemoglobin (10(-6) mol/l) abolished acetylcholine-mediated indicating that nitric oxide was the predominant mediator of the impaired basal release of nitric oxide after a 60-minute porcine serum exposure was reduced by half compared with coronary arteries exposed to autologous canine serum pretreated by either heat inactivation of complement or immunoadsorption with anti-c3 antibodies failed to depress endothelial-dependent relaxation on 60 minutes of exposure to canine coronary scanning electron microscopy revealed an intact endothelial layer in coronary arteries exposed to either porcine or canine serum for 60 hyperacute xenograft rejection impairs receptor-dependent relaxation of canine coronary arteries at 60 and 90 these data strongly suggest that impairment of endothelial production of nitric oxide during acute xenograft rejection is mediated by complement
[effect of intrahippocampal microinjection of enkephalin on cellular immune function and brain il-1 alpha gene expression in the effect of intrahippocampal microinjection of enkephalin on cellular immune function and hippocampal il-1 alpha gene expression was studied in the results showed (1) the proliferation activity of splenic lymphocytes stimulated by con a was significantly increased with microinjection of leu-enkephalin 1 microliter (18 mmol/l) or met-enkephalin 1 microliter (18 mmol/l) into bilateral but was inhibited by lipopolysaccharide 1 microliter (50 the proliferative response of splenic lymphocytes to leu-enkephalin still persisted after bilateral low doses of leu- or met-enkephalin 10(-11) mol/l) were also capable of causing proliferative activity of the con a- stimulated cultured splenic lymphocytes in (2) using rt-pcr il-1 alpha gene expression was detected in hippocampus 90 min after bilateral intrahippocampal injection of the lps-induced il-1 alpha gene expression in hippocampus could no longer be detected 30 min after microinjection of met- or leu-enkephalin into the above results suggested that intrahippocampal enkephalin might play an important role in neuro-immunomodulation by enhancing the inhibition of il-1 alpha gene expression in hippocampal
a stable intermediate product of the archaeal zinc-containing 7fe ferredoxin from sulfolobus strain 7 by artificial oxidative irreversible conversion of the purified zinc-containing 7fe ferredoxin from the thermoacidophilic archaeon sulfolobus strain 7 was found to occur under aerobic conditions at ph and at 4 degrees this process accompanied a substantial increase of the electron paramagnetic resonance signal attributed to a [3fe-4s]1+ and the converted form containing approximately 6 fe/zn (mol/mol) had a net charge different from that of the native 7fe these data provide evidence for the formation of a stable intermediate product of the archaeal ferredoxin having two [3fe-4s] clusters and a zinc center by artificial oxidative this further explains the discrepancy that a zinc center and two [3fe-4s] clusters (but not a zinc center and one [3fe-4s] cluster plus one [4fe-4s] cluster) are observed in the crystal structure at ph
the fetoplacental pressor effects of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid and angiotensin ii in the ex vivo cotyledon our purpose was to investigate perfusion pressure changes ex vivo induced by angiotensin ii on fetoplacental vasculature pretreated with low-dose acetylsalicylic study two cotyledons from each of 12 placentas were the intervillous space of one cotyledon was infused with acetylsalicylic acid (5 x 10(-5) mol/l) similar to the serum concentration of women receiving daily low-dose aspirin therapy (60 to 81 the control cotyledon was infused with an equivalent amount of normal saline two doses of angiotensin 1 x and 1 x 10(-10) were injected as boluses into the chorionic arteries of each a 3 x 10(-7) mole dose of angiotensin ii was also injected into the intervillous statistical analysis was performed with analysis of and results are expressed as mean pressure change in millimeters of mercury +/- perfusion pressure response did not vary between cotyledons pretreated with acetylsalicylic acid and control cotyledons when 3 x 10(-7) moles of angiotensin ii was injected into the intervillous space +/- mm hg vs +/- mm p = there were no differences between cotyledons in pressure response to 1 x moles of angiotensin ii injected into the fetal circuit +/- mm hg vs +/- mm p = in the cotyledons pretreated with acetylsalicylic acid there was a decrease in the pressor response to 1 x 10(-10) moles of angiotensin ii +/- mm hg vs +/- mm p = low-dose aspirin infused into the intervillous space decreases vasoconstriction elicited by angiotensin ii in the fetoplacental this suggests that maternal low-dose aspirin therapy has effects in the fetoplacental circulation in addition to its effects in the maternal
tissue-specific regulation of renal and cardiac atrial natriuretic factor gene expression in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt atrial natriuretic factor (anf) is expressed in several noncardiac tissues where it may have an autocrine or paracrine such function may be expected of locally synthesized anf in the renal previous investigations of the existence of anf mrna in the renal parenchyma have yielded conflicting the investigations reported here were designed to detect and measure anf mrna in normal rats and in rats subjected to a deoxycorticosterone acetate (doca)-salt treatment schedule known to strongly activate cardiac anf gene the expression of the renal anf gene was measured using a newly developed quantitative competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction this method uses an internal competitor that serves as an internal standard and makes the procedure independent of measurement relative to housekeeping it was found that renal anf mrna levels were 10(7) times lower than those found in left or right but immunoreactive (ir) renal anf concentration by specific radioimmunoassay was 10(4) times lower than that of atrial iranf reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that more than 99% of renal iranf is processed this finding suggests that most of the iranf measured in kidney extracts likely originates from atrial left atrial anf mrna levels after 1 week of doca-salt treatment was significantly higher than that of control rats x 10(-l5) mol/microg total rnaversus x 10(-5) mol/microg total renal anf mrna levels in doca-salt rats were significantly decreased compared with those of control rats x 10(-22) mol/microg total rna versus 10(-22) mol/microg total these results indicate that (1) renal anf mrna can be consistently and specifically demonstrated after reverse transcription and pcr (2) renal and cardiac anf synthesis are regulated in a opposite manner during doca-salt and (3) the finding that renal anf mrna is downregulated by doca-salt treatment together with previous findings suggest the need for further investigation into the role of renal anf mrna downregulation in the pathogenetic mechanism that leads to volume expansion and hypertension after chronic doca-salt
folding of an mrna pseudoknot required for stop codon effects of mono- and divalent ions on unfolding of an mrna pseudoknot that induces ribosome suppression of the gag gene stop codon in moloney murine leukemia virus has been studied by uv hyperchromicity and the pseudoknot melts in two corresponding to its two helical the total enthalpy of denaturation is approximately 170 approximately the value expected for the secondary at low salt concentrations (<50 mm kcl) the unfolding transitions are not but they approach two-state behavior at higher salt the structure is preferentially stabilized by smaller alkali metal ions (li+ > na+ > k+ > rb+ > cs+) and by the same preferences are exhibited by one of the stems in the context of a divalent metal ions are not required to fold the pseudoknot but do stabilize it to examine divalent ion effects over a wide concentration urea was used to lower the rna unfolding temperature and was shown not to affect characteristics of the pseudoknot unfolding in other the pseudoknot binds divalent ions somewhat more tightly than a hairpin but shows only weak selectivity for different size it is suggested that a region of divalent ion binding in between highly ligated specific sites and purely delocalized ion binding in is created by the pseudoknot fold but that delocalized ion binding contributes at least half the free energy of pseudoknot stabilization by
temperature dependence of histidine ionization constants in the standard enthalpy of ionization of six titratable histidines in horse metaquomyoglobin was determined by repeating proton nmr titrations as a function of temperature and using the hoff it was found that deltah degrees varies between 16 and 37 kj mol(-1) in the compared with a value of 29 kj mol(-1) in free the standard entropy change was evaluated by combining the enthalpy and free energy changes derived from the pka although the entropy change could not be precisely and accurately obtained by this it could be established that it spans a wide from -60 to 0 j k(-1) about the value of -23 j k(-1) mol(-1) for the free the entropy change was used within the framework of enthalpy-entropy compensation to partition the solvation component from the standard thermodynamic quantities for each of the titrating it was shown that the partitioning of the values in the protein is not readily understood in terms of solvent accessibility or electrostatic the contribution of solvation effects to the temperature response appeared to be significant only in the case of his-119 and the standard quantities were also used to explore the energetics of proton binding in the native state at temperatures below the onset of thermal

cell-specific differences in the susceptibility of potential cellular targets of human origin derived from blood and lung following treatment with the induction of cytochrome p4501a (cyp1a1) enzyme activity is one of the best-studied direct effects of (tcdd) and related compounds and has been shown to be a sensitive biomarker of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pah) in different experimental animal species as well as in tcdd has also been shown to modulate cytokine gene expression in human including il-1 tgf-alpha and tfg-beta in the present the aim was to determine whether different cellular targets of human origin differed in susceptibility to tcdd as measured by cyp1a1 activity and mrna and whether cytokine gene induction/suppression correlated with tcdd human airway epithelial alveolar macrophages peripheral blood monocytes and lymphocytes (pbl) were exposed to 10(-10)-10(-7) mol/l cyp1a1 enzyme activity was determined by ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (erod) mrna expression of cyp1a1 was measured by semiquantitative pcr the secretion and/or gene expression of specific including and il-1 beta were also there was a clear correlation between tcdd-induced enzyme activity and cyp1a1 mrna which were dose-dependently increased in the bronchoepithelial cells and the human airway epithelial cells (beas-s6 cell line and primary cells) appeared to be the most inducible cellular with up to 50-fold increases at 10(-8) mol/l tcdd with an ec50 of 3 x 10(-11) mol/l the pokeweed mitogen-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed approximately 5-fold less capacity in cyp1a1 with high interindividual variabilities (ec50 3 x 10(-9) mol/l in cyp1a1 enzyme activity in both am and purified peripheral blood which were costimulated with lps and/or could not be cyp1a1 mrna were detectable and only marginally enhanced in response to the ability of all these cells to express and produce the proinflammatory cytokines il-6 and il-8 was neither enhanced nor impaired by these results indicate that cell types found in human lung and peripheral blood vary in susceptibility to with the lung epithelium being highly susceptible and the alveolar macrophage being expression and production of specific cytokines such as il-6 and which may potentiate inflammatory processes and/or work as does not appear to be influenced by
bradykinin potentiates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and enhances insulin signal through the bradykinin b2 receptor in dog skeletal muscle and rat l6 previously we demonstrated that bradykinin infusion could increase glucose uptake into dog peripheral and that bradykinin could potentiate insulin-induced glucose uptake through glucose transporter 4 (glut4) translocation in dog skeletal muscle is the predominant tissue for insulin-mediated glucose the aim of this study was to determine how bradykinin affected insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in dog skeletal muscle and myotubes transformed from rat l6 the bradykinin receptor binding studies revealed that dog skeletal muscle and rat l6 myoblasts possessed significant numbers of bradykinin receptors (kd = 88 and 76 bmax = and 20 fmol/mg protein an rt-pcr (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) amplification showed mrna specific for bradykinin b2 receptor in both bradykinin significantly increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake in isolated muscle and l6 myoblasts in the presence of insulin (10(-7) mol/l) in a dose-dependent but not in the absence of bradykinin also enhanced insulin-stimulated glut4 and insulin-induced phosphorylation of insulin receptor beta subunit and insulin receptor substrate-1 (irs-1) without affecting the binding affinities or numbers of cell surface insulin receptors in both it is concluded that bradykinin could potentiate the insulin-induced glucose uptake through glut4 translocation in dog skeletal muscle and rat l6 this effect could be explained by the potency of bradykinin to upregulate the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity which stimulates phosphorylation of followed by an increase in glut4
irreversible thermal denaturation of uridine phosphorylase from escherichia coli thermal denaturation of uridine phosphorylase from escherichia coli k-12 has been studied by differential scanning the excess heat capacity temperature profiles were obtained at temperature scanning rates of and 1 these profiles were analysed using three models of irreversible denaturation which are approximations to the whole lumry-eyring the one-step model of irreversible the lumry-eyring model with the fast equilibrating first and the model involving two consecutive irreversible in terms of statistics the latter model describes the kinetics of thermal denaturation of uridine phosphorylase more satisfactorily than the two other the values of energy activation for the first and second steps calculated for the model involving two consecutive irreversible steps are the = +/- kj/mol and = +/-
interaction of triiodothyronine with d3 on interleukin-6-dependent osteoclast-like cell formation in mouse bone marrow cell in mouse bone marrow the formation of that tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive (trap+) and calcitonin (ct) receptor-positive multinucleated cells induced by 10(-10) to 10(-8) mol/l d3 could be augmented by triiodothyronine which alone had no effect on osteoclast-like cell the permissive effect of t3 increased the response to by approximately one order of linear concentration dependence was observed between 10(-11) and 10(-8) mol/l inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by indomethacin significantly impeded osteoclast-like cell formation by and abrogated the effect of t3 basal interleukin-6 (il-6) production by cultured marrow cells was significantly stimulated by even at an exceedingly high concentration of 20 il-6 was ineffective in inducing osteoclast-like cell any hormonally induced rise in il-6 release from bone marrow cells could not account for the observed changes in trap+ mnc the stimulatory effect of on osteoclastogenesis was partially dependent on il-6 because it could be significantly blocked by a neutralizing monoclonal anti-il-6 and to the same extent by a monoclonal anti-il-6 receptor unimpaired signaling through the il-6/il-6r system is also a prerequisite for the auxiliary effect of t3 on induction of osteoclast-like cells by our data provide evidence that induces osteoclast-like cell at least in in an il-6-dependent mode of which is also subject to modulation by the mechanism of interaction of the two hormones apparently involves joint stimulation of prostaglandin
pressure denaturation of evaluation of compressibility one of the key pieces of information from pressure denaturation experiments is the standard volume change for unfolding (delta the pressure dependence of the volume the standard compressibility change (delta is typically assumed to be zero in the analysis of these we show here that this assumption can be incorrect and that the neglect of compressibility differences can skew the interpretation of experimental analysis of variable-pressure nmr data for bovine pancreatic ribonuclease a in 2h2o at ph and 295 k yielded the following statistically non-zero delta k(o) t = +/- ml mol-1 delta v(o) = -21 +/- 2 ml and delta g(o) = +/- kcal the experimental protein stability is in good agreement with one (delta g(o) = kcal mol-1) determined independently for the same protein by calorimetry at atmospheric pressure under equivalent conditions and (1995) the positive value for delta k(o)t indicates that the denatured form of ribonuclease a is more compressible than the native this is explained in terms of an interplay between the intrinsic compressibility of the protein and solvation when the same data were fitted to a model that assumes a zero compressibility the delta g(o) value of 0 +/- kcal mol-1 returned by the model no longer agreed with the independent and the delta v(o) returned by the model was a very different -59 +/- 1 ml by it was not possible to carry out a similar thermodynamic analysis of fluorescence spectroscopic data for the denaturation of staphylococcal nuclease to yield well-defined values of delta delta and delta this limitation was shown by evaluation of synthetic data to be intrinsic to spectroscopic data whose analysis requires fitting of the plateaus at either side of the because nmr data do not have this they can be analyzed more
thermodynamic and structural consequences of flexible loop deletion by circular permutation in the streptavidin-biotin a circularly permuted streptavidin (cp51/46) has been designed to remove the flexible polypeptide loop that undergoes an open to closed conformational change when biotin is the original termini have been joined by a tetrapeptide and four loop residues have been resulting in the creation of new n- and isothermal titration calorimetric studies show that the association constant has been reduced approximately six orders of magnitude below that of wild-type streptavidin to 10(7) the deltah degrees of biotin association for cp51/46 is reduced by crystal structures of cp51/46 and its biotin complex show no significant alterations in the binding site upon removal of the a hydrogen bond between ser45 and ser52 found in the absence of biotin is broken in the closed conformation as the side-chain hydroxyl of ser45 moves to hydrogen bond to a ureido nitrogen of this is true in both the wild-type and cp51/46 forms of the and the hydrogen bonding interaction might thus help nucleate closure of the the reduced entropic cost of binding biotin to cp51/46 is consistent with the removal of this loop and a reduction in entropic costs associated with loop closure and the reduced enthalpic contribution to the free energy of binding is not readily explainable in terms of the molecular as the binding contacts are nearly entirely and only small differences in solvent accessible surfaces are observed relative to wild-type
position dependence of non-polar amino acid intrinsic helical until now and based on the success of the helix/coil transition theory it has been assumed that the alpha-helical propensities of the amino acids are position this has been critical to derive the set of theoretical parameters for the 20 natural amino we have analyzed the behavior of several non-polar met and gly at the at each position of the first helical turn and at a central helical position of a 16-residue peptide model system that starts with eight consecutive alanine we have interpreted the results from these experiments with the model of the helix/coil transition that indicates that the intrinsic helical propensity is position val and ile are more favorable at the first turn than in the middle of the while for leu and met we observe the opposite the differences between the observed helical propensities are as large as kcal/mol in some molecular modeling calculations using the ecepp/2 force-field equipped with a hydration potential show that this effect can be explained by the combination of three (a) the side-chains in the first helix turn are more (b) they have fewer intramolecular van der and (c) they posses higher configurational entropy than that in the central position of an the position-dependent results of the calculations are in reasonable agreement with the experimental estimates and with the intrinsic propensities of the amino acids derived from the statistical analysis of the protein structure copyright 1998 academic press

ineffectiveness of oxytocin on intercellular communication between term pregnant human myometrial cells before the effects of the uterotonic agent oxytocin on intercellular communication between term pregnant human myometrial cells before labor were studied to investigate its contribution to the synchronicity of uterine study the membrane potential and the input resistance of myometrial cells were measured with intracellular and dye-coupling assays were concomitantly performed while the tissues were perfused with three concentrations of oxytocin (10(-8) 10(-7) and 10(-6) the results were compared with those obtained from tissues perfused with gap junctional uncoupling agent octanol and those with solution octanol increased input resistance and inhibited dye coupling but did not affect membrane potential compared with oxytocin depolarized membrane potential at all studied the mean input resistance values and detectable dye propagation with oxytocin were similar to oxytocin does not contribute to gap junctional intercellular communication in term pregnant human myometrium before labor but may affect contractions by depolarizing membrane
arginine vasopressin enhances sympathetic constriction through the v1 vasopressin receptor in human saphenous arginine vasopressin (avp) not only acts directly on blood vessels through v1 receptor stimulation but also may modulate adrenergic-mediated responses in animal experiments in vivo and in the aim of the present study was to investigate whether avp can contribute to an abnormal adrenergic constrictor response of human saphenous methods and saphenous vein rings were obtained from 32 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass the vein rings were suspended in organ bath chambers for isometric recording of avp (3x10[-9] mol/l) enhanced the contractions elicited by electrical field stimulation at and 4 hz (by and respectively) and produced a leftward shift of the concentration-response curve to norepinephrine (half-maximal effective concentration decreased from to the v1 vasopressin receptor antagonist d(ch2)5tyr(me)avp (10[-6] mol/l) prevented the potentiation evoked by the selective v1 receptor agonist orn8]-vasotocin (3x[-10]-9 mol/l) induced potentiation of electrical stimulation-evoked which was also inhibited in the presence of the v1 receptor antagonist (10[-6] in the v2 receptor agonist desmopressin (10[-9] to 10[-7] mol/l) did not modify neurogenic and the v2 receptor antagonist arg8]-vasopressin (10[-8] to 10[-6] mol/l) did not prevent the potentiation induced by the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist nifedipine (10[-6] mol/l) did not affect the potentiating effect of the results suggest that low concentrations of avp facilitate sympathetic neurotransmission and potentiate constrictor effects of norepinephrine in human saphenous these effects appear to be mediated by v1 receptor stimulation and are independent of calcium entry through dihydropyridine calcium avp may contribute to vascular mechanisms involved in acute ischemic syndromes associated with venous particularly if the sympathetic nervous system is

[injury effects of nicotine on isolated rat common carotid to investigate the injured effects of nicotine on isolated rat common carotid artery and to supply experimental proofs for vascular vessel and organ asins relaxing and contractile functional test of isolated vascular vessel and scanning electron microscopy we observed the influence of nicotine on the contractile and the relaxing function of isolated artery and the intact of the lower concentrations of nicotine (6 x-10 mol/l-6 x 10(-6) mol/l) produced a concentration-dependent constrictor response of 18%-41% relative to those induced by norepinephrine 10(-7) whereas removal of endothelium reduced nicotine-induced constrictions to higher concentrations of nicotine (6 x 10(-5) mol/l-6 x 10(-3) mol/l) not only injured contractile function of vascular smooth muscle but also caused severe damage to the various concentrations of nicotine all inhibited acetylcholine-induced relaxation nicotine not only has cytotoxicity to vascular vessel but also results in vasoconstrictor effects which depend upon endothelium probably by inhibiting the release of endothelium-derived relaxing
polymorphic copies of sry in both males and females of the vole microtus in sex determination is controlled by the y-linked gene although sry is male-specific in most eutherian and marsupial with a single copy on the y several rodent species have multiple y-linked copies of and two mole-vole species of the genus ellobius determine sex without the y chromosome or the sry we searched for homologs of sry in three vole species of the genus microtus and concluded that this gene is not male-specific in as it is present in polymorphic copies in both males and in sry is male-specific in the related species agrestis and up to 15 different partial sequences of the sry gene were found in southern blots suggest that most of the extra copies of sry are one of the copies observed only in males has a sequence identical to that of the sry gene in agrestis and may represent a functional copy of the gene in this the rest are probably nonfunctional
the effect of boundary selection on the stability and folding of the third fibronectin type iii domain from human correct selection of domain boundaries is critical for structural analysis of single domains from multimodular folding and stability studies of the third fibronectin type iii domain from human tenascin (tnfn31-90) have shown that it is moderately stable (delta g(d-n)(h2o) approximately 5 kcal mol-1) and folds with two-state in an attempt to stabilize the five domains were constructed with different combinations of extensions to the n- and thermal denaturation studies show that a specific two amino acid (gly-leu) extension at the c-terminus is primarily responsible for a significant increase in the delta delta g(d-n)(h2o) of the gly-leu extension (tnfn3(1-92)) is +/- kcal refolding kinetics do not differ but unfolding is slowed mutation of leucine 92 to alanine does not affect indicating that the stability of the extension does not come from the packing of the leucine side hydrogen exchange data suggest that the extension adds new hydrogen bonds and strengthens existing hydrogen bonds in the c-terminal interaction with the a-b and e-f removal of a very small number of hydrogen bonds substantially increases the unfolding a phenomenon which may be important in stress-relaxation of fniii-containing muscle proteins such as these experiments demonstrate the importance of a small number of additional long-range interactions in the overall formation of a compact independently folding beta-sheet

material property characteristics for lipid bilayers containing the apparent area expansion modulus and tensile strength of egg phosphatidylcholine (epc) membranes are measured in the presence of monooleoylphosphatidylcholine the apparent area expansion modulus decreases from 171 mn m-1 for pure epc membrane to 82 mn m-1 for a membrane containing 30 mol % this significant decrease of the apparent area expansion modulus is attributed to the change of the membrane area due to the tension-dependent exchange of mopc between the bathing solution and the similar to the apparent area expansion the tensile strength of the membrane decreases with the increase of the molar concentration of mopc in the the tensile strength of pure epc membrane is mn m-1 whereas that for a membrane containing 30 mol % mopc is only mn and for a membrane containing 50 mol % mopc it is even on the order of mn the decrease of the tensile strength is coupled with a decrease of the work for membrane which changes from x 10(-2) kt for pure epc membrane to 2 x 10(-6) kt for a membrane with 50 mol % these results show that the decrease of the apparent area expansion modulus in the presence of exchangeable molecules is a fundamental property for all membranes and depends on the area occupied by these the method presented here provides a unique tool for measuring the area occupied by an exchangeable molecule in the bilayer

a general rule for the relationship between hydrophobic effect and conformational stability of a stability and structure of a series of hydrophobic mutants of human to get a general rule for the relationship between hydrophobic effect and conformational five ile to val and nine val to ala mutants (3ss mutants) from 3ss (c77a/c95a) human lysozyme were as known from previous the 3ss protein lacking a disulfide bond between cys77 and cys95 is destabilized by enthalpic as revealed by a decrease of about 20 kj/mol in the denaturation gibbs energy change (deltag) as compared to the wild-type which has four disulfide in this the stabilities and structures of the 3ss mutants were determined by differential scanning calorimetry and x-ray crystal and compared with those of the mutants (4ss mutants) from the wild-type (4ss) protein published stabilities of all the 3ss except for v110a-3ss were decreased as compared with that of the 3ss coinciding with the results for the 4ss the change in the denaturation gibbs energy change (deltadeltag) values of the 3ss mutants relative to the 3ss protein at the denaturation temperature degreesc) of the 3ss protein at ph were similar to those of the equivalent 4ss mutants relative to the wild-type at delta deltag values of the 3ss mutants correlated with the changes in hydrophobic surface area exposed upon denaturation (delta deltaasahp) for all of the hydrophobic residues when the effects of the secondary structure propensity were this correlation is identical with that previously found for the 4ss the linear relation between delta deltag and delta deltaasahp for all of the hydrophobic residues with the same slope was found also for the mutants of t4 lysozyme already indicating that this is a general relationship between changes in conformational stability and changes in asa values of hydrophobic residues due to copyright 1998 academic
[the intratumoral levels of thymidylate synthetase and folate in gastric and colon biochemical modulation for 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) is one of the most successful chemotherapy for both colo-rectal and gastric the purpose of this study is to evaluate the significance of measuring intratumoral thymidylate synthetase (ts) and folate (fh4) levels as predictive parameters for the successful samples were collected from 16 advanced colo-rectal and 21 advanced gastric ts and tetrahydrofolate levels in the specimens were measured by binding results showed that there were no significant difference in ts levels between the different pathologic types of on the other well +/- p mol/g) and moderately +/- p mol/g) differentiated carcinoma showed lower fh4 levels compared to poorly differentiated carcinoma +/- p in biochemical modulation by cisplatin or which elevates intratumoral folate is more needed for well and moderately differentiated measuring ts levels can also be important because two cases who responded to cisplatin/5-fu chemotherapy showed low ts levels compared to the others who had lower
new modular delivery system for diagnostic and therapeutic pre-targeting using tautomer-specific monoclonal antibody em-6-47 and 3-substituted we have developed a new modular affinity system for the 2-step delivery of functional molecules to target the system is based on the tautomer-specific monoclonal antibody (mab) which binds to 3- and adenines with high affinity (ka > 10(9) l/mol) without cross-reacting with naturally occurring purine this mab serves as the hapten-specific fusion partner to produce bispecific mabs (bs-mabs) recognizing a target cell antigen and a hapten as carrier molecule either the c-8 or the n-3 position of adenines can be used for conjugation with effector the remaining position may be substituted with different moieties to modulate the pharmacokinetics of the different 3- and adenines conjugated to the chelates dota and dtpa or to the drug daunomycin were adenine-chelate derivatives were efficiently labeled with (111)in and while high-affinity binding of 3-substituted adenines to mab em-6-47 remained almost unaffected by the conjugation to to confirm the validity of the delivery a prototype was generated by somatic cell fusion of mab em-6-47 and mab the latter recognizing a surface antigen on canine hematopoietic two-step targeting assays in vitro verified the dose-dependent delivery of (111)in-labeled adenine-chelate derivatives to myeloid this system represents a powerful tool for new pre-targeting approaches relying on bs-mabs and suitable cellular antigens can be targeted by fusing the appropriate mabs with hapten-specific mab and tailor-made 3-substituted adenines may be labeled with diagnostic or therapeutic cytotoxic drugs or other functional
characterization of a partially unfolded structure of cytochrome c induced by sodium dodecyl sulphate and the kinetics of its the mechanism of unfolding of ferricytochrome c induced by the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate has been studied by heme tryptophan circular resonance raman stopped-flow and time-resolved resonance energy transfer to obtain a comprehensive view of the whole unfolding occurred at an almost specific molecular ratio of sds/cytochrome c in the concentration range (20-50 microm) studied however there appears to be a point at approximately mm sds where unfolding begins to occur for lower cytochrome c the kinetics of unfolding revealed only a single transition with a rate constant of 33 s(-1) (at 298 [sds] = mm) and activation energy barrier of approximately 16 indicating that other associated if are too fast to be significantly the free energy change (deltag(o)) involved with the unfolding transition was estimated to be about the cd spectrum at 220 nm of sds-unfolded cytochrome c shows only a partial decrease indicating that a significant amount of helical structure remains folded in contrast to a complete loss of helical structure in gdnhcl-denatured cytochrome the heme structure in sds-unfolded cytochrome as deduced from heme absorption and resonance raman shows a major population (approximately 95%) of mis-ligated histidine to the heme which acts as a kinetic trap in the folding the structural changes associated with cytochrome c unfolding were also monitored by time-resolved resonance energy transfer which shows a drastic increase in tryptophan fluorescence lifetime from 12 ps in the native protein to ns in the unfolded associated with a movement of trp59 by 10 a away from the maximum entropy method analysis of fluorescence decay indicated the growth of various conformational substates in sds-unfolded cytochrome c in contrast to narrowly distributed conformations in the native the refolding was comprised of three kinetic the first was significantly fast (approximately 8 ms) and was assigned to the dissociation of his26 that paves the protein towards correct folding the other two slower steps probably arise from chain misorganization and prolyl the absence of a burst-phase amplitude supports the idea that the burst phase observed in the folding from completely unfolded cytochrome c corresponds to a molecular collapse that produces significant secondary the partially unfolded state represents a unique intermediate state in the folding

insulin-mediated growth in aortic smooth muscle and the vascular renin-angiotensin insulin has been shown to directly affect blood vessel tone and to promote vascular but the mechanism of these actions remains because angiotensin i (ang i)-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to improve insulin action and to impede the progression of vascular hypertrophy in hypertensive animal it is possible that the vascular properties of insulin may be mediated through the tissue renin-angiotensin system to evaluate this we first investigated the effect of insulin on components of the ras using cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells insulin treatment (1000 microu/ml) markedly increased angiotensinogen mrna expression and angiotensinogen we next investigated the role of the ras in insulin-mediated cell using [3h]thymidine studies were done both with insulin alone and in the presence of captopril (1x10(-7) to 10(-5) mol/l) and losartan (1x10(-9) to 10(-7) [3h]thymidine uptake was increased significantly by 1000 microu/ml and this stimulation was reduced by 1x10(-6) mol/l captopril and by 1x10(-8) mol/l losartan further studies showed that the degree of insulin-mediated [3h]thymidine uptake in vsmcs could be duplicated by 4x10(-10) mol/l ang losartan reduced the effects of both ang ii and insulin on [3h]thymidine uptake by about 40% to 45% of baseline captopril reduced insulin-mediated [3h]thymidine uptake but did not affect ang ii-mediated [3h]thymidine in insulin induced significant stimulation of angiotensinogen expression and production and stimulated growth similar to that seen with ang ii in cultured rat inhibition of ang ii production or its binding to the ang ii type 1 (at1) receptor inhibited insulin-mediated growth in a fashion similar to that seen with inhibition of ang ii-mediated insulin can modulate the vascular and the effect of insulin on vascular growth may be via direct effects on angiotensinogen expression and translation operative through both the at1 receptor and the conversion of ang i to ang
