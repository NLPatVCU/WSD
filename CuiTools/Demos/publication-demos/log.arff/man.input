proposed changes in the classification of carcinogenic chemicals in the work carcinogenic chemicals in the work area are currently classified into three categories in section iii of the german list of mak and bat this classification is based on qualitative criteria and reflects essentially the weight of evidence available for judging the carcinogenic potential of the it is proposed that these and iiib--be retained as categories and to conform with eu on the basis of our advancing knowledge of reaction mechanisms and the potency of it is now proposed that these three categories be supplemented with two additional the essential feature of substances classified in the new categories is that exposure to these chemicals does not convey a significant risk of cancer to provided that an appropriate exposure limit (mak value) is it is proposed that chemicals known to act typically by nongenotoxic mechanisms and for which information is available that allows evaluation of the effects of low-dose exposures be classified in category genotoxic chemicals for which low carcinogenic potency can be expected on the basis of dose-response relationships and toxicokinetics and for which risk at low doses can be assessed will be classified in category the basis for a better differentiation of carcinogens is the new categories are and possible criteria for classification are examples for category 4 and category 5 (styrene) are the proposed changes in classifying carcinogenic chemicals in the work area are presented for further

understanding a broad biological approach makes it possible to understand why ageing exists and also why different mammalian species have very different maximum the adult organism is maintained in a functional state by at least ten major which together comprise a substantial proportion of all biological these maintenance mechanisms eventually because the evolved physiological and anatomical design of higher animals is incompatible with continual the lifespan of each mammalian species depends on the efficiency of maintenance of their tissues and and there is much evidence that such maintenance is more effective in long-lived such as than in short-lived small it is also evident that there is an inverse relationship between reproductive potential and which would be expected if total metabolic resources are shared between investment in and investment in the preservation of the adult it is proposed that the eventual failure of maintenance leads to the pathological changes seen in age-associated although we now have a biological understanding of the ageing much future research will be needed to uncover the cellular and molecular changes which give rise to age-associated the major aim of such research is to devise procedures to delay or prevent the onset of these
