role of angiotensin ii in activation of the jak/stat pathway induced by acute pressure overload in the rat this study was designed to determine whether the jak/stat (indicating just another kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway is activated in cardiac hypertrophy induced in vivo by pressure overload in rats and to demonstrate whether angiotensin ii is involved in the activation of the jak/stat acute pressure overload was produced by constricting the abdominal aorta of wistar immunoprecipitation-western blot analysis revealed that pressure overload activated and tyk2 as early as 5 minutes and that and stat3 were tyrosine-phosphorylated rapidly after exposure to the pressure phosphorylation of stat1 and stat2 peaked in the early stage at 5 to 15 whereas that of stat3 peaked in the late stage at 60 gel mobility shift of the interferon gamma activation site/interferon alpha-stimulating response element was observed immediately after the aortic whereas the band of sis-inducing element was shifted in the late stage at 60 both cilazapril (angiotensin ii-converting enzyme inhibitor) and e4177 (angiotensin ii type 1 [at1] receptor antagonist) significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of tyk2 and partially inhibited the phosphorylation of but neither affected coimmunoprecipitation of the at1 receptor with jak2 or tyk2 was clearly observed at 5 minutes and peaked at 15 minutes (20-fold the control these results indicate that the jak/stat pathway is activated by acute pressure overload in rats and that angiotensin ii is involved in activating and partially activating via the at1 both angiotensin ii-dependent and -independent pathways take part in activating the jak/stat pathway in the pressure-overloaded rat
a comparison of ultrasonographically detected cervical changes in response to transfundal and standing in predicting cervical our purpose was to compare various noninvasive stress techniques for their ability to elicit ultrasonographic cervical changes and to determine their efficacy in detecting ultrasonographic cervical study eighty-nine patients at risk for pregnancy loss and preterm birth underwent ultrasonographic evaluation of the cervix at least twice between 15 and 24 weeks of with use of a transvaginal the funnel funnel and endocervical canal length were measured in millimeters with the patient in the supine these measurements were repeated after three stress transfundal and the difference between the baseline measurements and those obtained after the stress tests were a positive response to stress was defined as any decrease in endocervical canal length accompanied by an increase in funnel width and improvement was defined by any increase in endocervical canal length accompanied by a decrease in funnel width and cervical incompetence was defined as the presence of progressive cervical changes on ultrasonographic examinations with final endocervical canal length measurements below 26 results are reported as median the number of positive cervical responses to transfundal pressure 17/89) was significantly greater than to coughing 3/89) and standing the status of the cervix improved with standing in three whereas this was not seen with transfundal pressure or there was no case where there was a positive response to standing or coughing and not to transfundal when the changes in funnel width and length and endocervical canal length as a result of transfundal pressure and standing in the 17 cases that responded to transfundal transfundal pressure resulted in a significantly greater increase in funnel width and length and a decrease in endocervical canal the efficacy of transfundal pressure in detecting the cervix that had subsequent progressive changes on ultrasonography was as sensitivity specificity and positive and negative predictive values and the efficacy of coughing was sensitivity specificity and positive and negative predictive values 100% and the efficacy of standing was sensitivity specificity and positive and negative predictive values 75% and similar results were obtained when the analysis was confined to 37 patients who had a prior history of a midtrimester transfundal pressure was the most effective technique in eliciting cervical changes during the active assessment of the cervix during pregnancy and the most sensitive in detecting the cervix that had progressive second-trimester cervical shortening during compared with coughing or standing

cardiopulmonary physiology of primary blast bomb blast survivors are occasionally found in profound shock and hypoxic without external signs of we investigated the cardiovascular and pulmonary responses of rats subjected to a blast pressure prospectively controlled animal materials and rats were instrumented and subjected to a blast pressure wave of different intensities from a blast wave cardiopulmonary parameters were recorded for 3 hours or until measurements and main the cardiovascular response to a blast pressure wave was immediate and low cardiac three hours the rats developed low cardiac and low stroke systemic vascular resistance remained the pulmonary response was a decreased pao2 and stable suggesting a ventilation-perfusion mismatch from massive pulmonary blast-induced circulatory shock resulted from immediate myocardial depression without a compensatory hypoxia presumably resulted from a ventilation-perfusion mismatch caused by pulmonary
the effect of sarcoplasmic reticulum blockade on the force/frequency relationship and systolic contraction patterns in the newborn pig we investigated the relationship between heart rate and contractility in seven anaesthetized young piglets by measuring contractility at different atrial pacing to study the origin of this relationship we repeated the measurements after blocking the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel with we assessed contractility using indices derived from instantaneous left ventricular pressure and volume measured by micromanometric and conductance catheters during rapid inferior vena cava thus generating the end-systolic pressure-volume which was characterized by its slope and the maximum rate of change of ventricular pressure (dp/dtmax)/end-diastolic volume also characterized by its all animals showed an increase in contractility with increasing heart rate (intact force/frequency relationship) which was abolished after the most striking effect of ryanodine on baseline haemodynamics was the dramatic decrease of dp/dtmax to about 50% of its original while peak developed pressure and ees did not we conclude that the young despite its has a functional sarcoplasmic illustrated by an intact force/frequency in blockade of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in vivo has profoundly different effects during early and late indicating that indices of contractility derived during different parts of the cardiac cycle represent different aspects of

pulmonary blood volume and its effects on pressure/flow relations and flow resistance in isolated lungs of quantitative information about the effects of pulmonary blood volume (qp) on pulmonary haemodynamics is lacking since qp changes inevitably with to separate flow-dependent from volume-dependent changes in intravascular pressures we imposed changes in qp (measured continuously) by altering outflow pressure in seven blood-perfused rabbit lungs and studied the effects of qp on the relations between arteriovenous pressure gradient (deltap) and blood flow under two flow-dependent volume changes were either permitted or in the latter deltap changed more for a given change in the relations were shifted to smaller deltap when qp was the calculated flow resistance (r = decreased with increasing qp at a given assuming constant changes in r can be predicted from changes in vessel geometry and thus we found that r increased less than expected (by a factor of instead of 9) when qp was reduced to this discrepancy may be explained by a change in blood distribution within the lung despite constant qp and by a change in apparent blood viscosity with regardless of these speculations we have shown that qp determines deltap at each flow and thus flow
adrenergic control of the force-frequency and relaxation-frequency relations in patients with hypertrophic exercise-induced enhancement of the force-frequency and relaxation-frequency relations has been studied in conscious animals but not in intact diseased human methods and we evaluated left ventricular (lv) isovolumic contraction (dp/dt(max)) and relaxation (tau) during atrial pacing and dynamic exercise in 13 patients with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) and 7 control subjects to investigate the influence of exercise on the force-frequency and relaxation-frequency group a consisted of 6 patients in whom the heart rate (hr)-dp/dt(max) relation was markedly enhanced during exercise (88+/-30%) compared with during pacing group b consisted of 7 patients in whom the hr-dp/dt(max) relation showed similar enhancement during exercise (28+/-7%) and atrial pacing there was no difference in the hr-tau (derivative method [td] and pressure half-time method [t(1/2)]) relation between pacing and exercise in groups a and both the mean maximal wall thickness and the hypertrophy score in group b were greater than in group a (27+/-5 versus 19+/-2 mm and 7+/-1 versus 5+/-1 both there was no difference in the lv peak systolic end-diastolic or the plasma level of catecholamines at at 50 w of and at peak pacing between groups a and the hr-dp/dt(max) relation in the control group was markedly enhanced during exercise (80+/-27%) compared with during pacing the hr-tau relation in the control group was enhanced during exercise 34+/-8%) compared with during pacing exercise-induced enhancement of the relaxation-frequency relation was inhibited in all hcm regardless of the degree of lv the patients without exercise-induced enhancement of the force-frequency relation had more severe lv hypertrophy than the patients with the indicating that the adrenergic control of the force-frequency relation at least in depend on the severity of lv hypertrophy or the stage of

neural-mechanical coupling of breathing in rem during rapid-eye-movement (rem) sleep the ventilatory response to airway occlusion is possible mechanisms are reduced mechanical impairment of the chest wall secondary to the atonia of rem or phasic rem events that interrupt or fractionate ongoing diaphragm electromyogram (emg) to differentiate between these we studied three chronically instrumented dogs and after 15-20 s of airway occlusion during non-rem (nrem) and phasic rem we found that 1) for a given inspiratory time the integrated diaphragm emg (di) was similar or reduced in rem sleep relative to nrem 2) for a given di in response to airway occlusion and the hyperpnea following the mechanical output (flow or pressure) was similar or reduced during rem sleep relative to nrem 3) for comparable durations of airway occlusion the di and integrated inspiratory tracheal pressure tended to be smaller and more variable in rem than in nrem and 4) significant fractionations (caused visible changes in tracheal pressure) of the diaphragm emg during airway occlusion in rem sleep occurred in approximately 40% of breathing thus reduced and/or erratic mechanical output during and after airway occlusion in rem sleep in terms of flow tidal and/or pressure generation is attributable largely to reduced neural activity of the which in turn is likely attributable to rem causing reduced chemosensitivity at the level of the peripheral chemoreceptors more at the central chest wall distortion secondary to the atonia of rem sleep may contribute to the reduced mechanical output following airway occlusion when ventilatory drive is

estimating the contributions of nmda and non-nmda currents to epsps in retinal ganglion whole-cell recordings were obtained from retinal ganglion cells of the tiger salamander (ambystoma tigrinum) in a superfused slice preparation to evaluate contributions of nmda (n-methyl-d-aspartate) and ka/ampa (kainate/alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxalone propionic acid) receptors to excitatory postsynaptic potentials (epsps) of retinal ganglion synaptic activation of retinal ganglion cells was achieved through the use of a brief pressure pulse of hyperosmotic ringer (ringer + sucrose) delivered through a microelectrode visually placed in the inner plexiform layer while whole-cell recordings were obtained from adjacent cells in the ganglion cell separation of nmda and ka/ampa excitatory postsynaptic currents (epscs) was achieved through the application of the antagonists nbqx and while inhibitory currents were blocked by strychnine and simple addition of the two independent epscs most that the sum of the ka/ampa and nmda currents was less than the control but in some cases the sum of the two currents exceeded the magnitude of the control neither result was consistent with expectations based on voltage-clamp principles and the assumption that the two currents were for this we considered the possibility of nonlinear interactions between ka/ampa and nmda computer simulations were carried out to evaluate the summation we used both an equivalent cylinder model and a more compartmental model of a ganglion cell constrained by a passive leakage a linear ka/ampa synaptic and a nonlinear nmda current based on the voltage-sensitive mg2+ computer simulation studies suggest that the hypo- and hyper-summation of nmda and ka/ampa observed can be accounted for by a failure to adequately space clamp the clamp failure leads to enhanced nmda currents as the ion channels are relieved of the mg2+ their contribution is thus exaggerated depending on the magnitude of the conductance change and the spatial location of the synaptic

the pressure dependence of hydrophobic interactions is consistent with the observed pressure denaturation of proteins can be denatured by pressures of a few hundred this finding apparently contradicts the most widely used model of protein where the formation of a hydrophobic core drives protein the pressure denaturation puzzle is resolved by focusing on the pressure-dependent transfer of water into the protein in contrast to the transfer of nonpolar residues into the approach commonly taken in models of protein pressure denaturation of proteins can then be explained by the pressure destabilization of hydrophobic aggregates by using an information theory model of hydrophobic pressure-denatured unlike heat-denatured retain a compact structure with water molecules penetrating their activation volumes for hydrophobic contributions to protein folding and unfolding kinetics are clathrate hydrates are predicted to form by virtually the same mechanism that drives pressure denaturation of

[taurine as a regulator of fluid-electrolyte balance and arterial taurine is a sulfonic beta-amino acid which occurs in the highest concentration in the the retina and in the in cardiomyocytes it presents about 50% of free amino acids and plays a role as an an inotropic factor and has an antiarrhythmic taurine lowers arterial pressure by extension of diuresis and by similar effect on the vascular system and arterial pressure is exerted by atrial natriuretic peptide increase of both anp secretion and myocardial taurine concentration is present in the same diseases as congestive cardiac hypertension and the aim of the study was the evaluation of general taurine caused by making the rats drink guanidinoethyl sulfonate (ges)--an inhibitor of taurine transport affecting fluid balance and arterial pressure as well as plasma anp concentration under normal conditions and after increase of sodium the 103 male wistar rats weighing 250-300 g were the animals were separated into 5 control group received tap water to group ii was sodium-loaded by drinking 171 mmol/l in group iii depletion of taurine was obtained by the intake of 60 mmol/l rats in group iv were drinking 60 mmol/l ges in 171 mmol/l group v was made to drink 200 mmol/l taurine in 171 mmol/l all animals had standard food and were able at any time to duration of the experiment was 20 at the onset and after 10 and 20 days the rats were weighed and their systolic blood pressure was measured by tail after 10 and 20 days of the plasma and myocardium taurine plasma urea and creatinine concentrations were taking ges for 20 days led to 43% decrease of plasma taurine and its myocardium content about 50% as compared to control group statistically significant correlation (r = p < between myocardium taurine and plasma anp was the animals with taurine depletion had significantly lower (about 30%) plasma anp concentration higher natremia 4) and their arterial pressure increased due to sodium systolic pressure was 11 mm hg higher in that group in comparison to control and other groups the sodium-loading of the rats that drank taurine solution led to an increase of plasma urea concentration and body mass gain as compared to control but without any arterial pressure the sodium-loaded rats with normal plasma and myocardium taurine concentration were affected in a similar the rats with higher myocardium taurine concentration had lower heart mass results of this work lead to the following depletion of taurine in hearts of examined rats leads to a decrease of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) concentration in anp secretion caused by salt loading is lower in animals with taurine depletion than in normal sodium-loading of animals with taurine depletion leads to hypernatremia and to an increase of arterial addition of taurine to animals loaded with sodium may lead to their
stimulation of lung growth by tracheal obstruction in fetal relation to luminal pressure and lung liquid obstruction of the fetal trachea causes liquid to accumulate within the future which is a potent stimulus for lung our aim was to determine the relationship between the increase in fetal lung growth after tracheal obstruction and the increases in lung liquid volume and tracheal pressure to better understand the mechanisms involved in the growth the effects of 4 and 10 d of tracheal obstruction on lung dna and protein contents and dna synthesis rates were these data were combined with data collected previously after 2 and 7 d of tracheal fetal lung liquid volumes and secretion rates were measured before (d 0) and on d and 10 after tracheal fetal tracheal pressures were monitored throughout this tracheal pressures increased from +/- mm hg (control) to +/- mm hg within 1 d of tracheal obstruction and remained at this elevated level for the duration of the obstruction lung liquid volume increased progressively from +/- ml/kg on d 0 to +/- ml/kg at d 7 of tracheal but had not increased further by d tracheal obstruction significantly increased lung dna and protein contents above control over the 10-d period the increase in lung dna content was closely related (r = to the increase in lung liquid but not to the increase in tracheal dna synthesis rates were increased at 4 d of tracheal obstruction (by 66%) but had returned to control levels by d we conclude 1) the mechanisms responsible for the acceleration in lung growth induced by tracheal obstruction are most active on d remain active at a reduced level on d 4 and and have returned to control levels by d and 2) the increase in lung dna content during tracheal obstruction (d 2-7) is closely related to the increase in lung liquid but not to the increase in intraluminal we suggest that an increase in lung expansion is one of the primary factors responsible for the acceleration in fetal lung growth induced by tracheal
