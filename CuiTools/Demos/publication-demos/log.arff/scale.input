thermal denaturation of ribonuclease a characterized by water 17o and 2h magnetic relaxation water oxygen-17 and deuteron nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (nmrd) measurements were used to characterize ribonuclease a (rnase a) in the course of thermal denaturation at ph 2 and the structure and dynamics of the protein were probed by specific long-lived water by the short-lived surface and by labile side-chain the nmrd data show that native rnase a contains at least three water molecules with a mean residence time of 8 ns at 27 degreesc and an activation enthalpy of 40 kj these water molecules are identified with some or all of six ordered water molecules partly buried in surface pockets in the crystal structure of rnase the loss of the 17o dispersion at higher temperatures demonstrates in the thermally denatured these surface pockets are either not present or undergoing large structural fluctuations on a subnanosecond time the relaxation dispersion step vanishes monotonically and essentially in concert with the cd denaturation thus ruling out the existence of equilibrium intermediates with a substantial amount of non-native and long-lived hydration the nmrd data show that thermally denatured rnase a has a relatively compact but highly flexible the global solvent exposure and the hydrodynamic volume of the denatured protein are much less than for maximally unfolded disulfide-intact rnase the nmrd data show that thermal denaturation is accompanied by a large reduction of the mean-square orientational order parameter of side-chain o-h implying in the denatured these side chains sample a wide distribution of conformational states on a subnanosecond time
abnormal amino acid metabolism in patients with early stage alzheimer plasma levels of several amino acids were studied in 14 patients with early stage probable disease (ad) and 17 age-matched in the ad patients a possible relationship between amino acid levels and behavioural symptomatology was also we found significantly reduced levels of tryptophan and methionine in plasma samples from the ad patients compared to the control plasma tyrosine/large neutral amino acids (lnaa) ratio and the ratio of plasma taurine and the product of the plasma levels of methionine and serine (tsm-ratio) were significantly increased in the ad patients in comparison with the no difference was found in plasma tryptophan/lnaa ratio and in homocysteine levels between both concerning the behavioural symptomatology no significant correlation was found between the reisberg behave ad scale and plasma amino acid levels or the reported findings suggest that abnormal amino acid metabolism is present in the early stages of we hypothesize that this abnormality could play a role in the pathogenesis of behavioural changes occurring in later stages of
the dimensionality and validity of the older americans resources and services (oars) activities of daily living (adl) the psychometric properties of the oars adl comprised of seven physical activities of daily living (padl) and seven instrumental activities of daily living (iadl) were examined using a rasch measurement two of the padl items failed to demonstrate acceptable goodness-of-fit with the measurement model but the remaining 12 items could be combined into a single measure of adl although the oars adl scale was designed to identify those community-dwelling elderly who need supports and services to continue to live in the the scale items were found to be poorly targeted to community-dwelling elderly since almost half of our sample received maximal rasch analysis identified how we might improve the sensitivity of the oars adl scale but its utility in outcome and longitudinal studies remains
postexcitatory inhibition after transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex in patients with drug-induced parkinsonism and in healthy the duration of the postexcitatory inhibition after transcranial magnetic stimulation was investigated in 16 patients with drug-induced parkinsonism and in 20 healthy control in the the chlorpromazine-equivalent of the neuroleptic medication was and the severity of the drug-induced parkinsonism was measured using the simpson-angus scale group comparison (u-test) revealed a significant shorter postexcitatory inhibition in patients than in control regression analyses showed a negative correlation between the simpson-angus scale score and the duration of the postexcitatory the correlation only reached significance for a group of patients who received at least one butyrophenone no clear-cut relation was found between the chlorpromazine equivalent and the postexcitatory these results indicate that drug-induced parkinsonism shares features of genuine it seems possible to assess the extrapyramidal side effect of butyrophenone but not for other neuroleptic by means of the method
improving the specific gravity adjustment method for assessing urinary concentrations of toxic changes in urinary flow induce changes in urinary concentrations of toxic the authors modified the conventional specific gravity adjustment method for measuring urinary concentration of toxic substances to compensate for the dilution effects from varying degrees of the conventional specific gravity adjustment method is a special case to the more general method proposed in this the conventional method generally does not correct the urinary concentration to the mean specific gravity of it requires the assumption that a change in urine flow preserves the relative ratio between the mass of the xenobiotic and the mass of total dissolved the derivation of the modified specific gravity adjustment method shows that a change in urine flow does not necessarily preserve this an experimental slope between urinary flow and urinary specific gravity was linear on a log a ratio was formed between the experimental slope and slopes for various substances to predict changes in urine concentrations due to changes in the specific gravity of a spot since excretion rates typically vary for different substances with changes in urinary an appropriately weighted exponential adjustment factor is required for each substance to normalize its concentration to the standard specific gravity of

social inequality in coronary heart a comparison of occupational the british registrar social classification has been strongly criticised for its lack of explanatory studies of social inequality in coronary heart disease (chd) outcomes have often found associations between measures of inequality and heart disease unaccounted by conventional chd risk alternative occupational classifications such as the erikson-goldthorpe schema and the cambridge scale could be used to explore potential causal narratives which explain such residual results from a longitudinal study of adults in britain show that the cambridge scale has the strongest association with chd and part of its strength is due to its strong association with chd related health women classified by their occupation had stronger associations with chd compared to classifications by their own job strain may not account for the observed social inequalities in the cambridge scale shows stronger patterns of linear association with chd than the rgsc and should be included in other studies of social inequality in health in the
quantitative elisa-polymerase chain reaction at saturation using homologous internal dna standards and chemiluminescence in this we describe the development and validation of a versatile and high throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) this assay is based on the use of only one concentration of an internal homologous standard (is) easily obtained by replacing an 18 nt specific sequence using recombinant target and is amplicons are quantitated at the pcr plateau phase using elisa which includes a hybridization step with either target or is specific probes and luminometric luminometry allows measurement of amplicon levels without the need for serial experimental values were obtained by comparing their target/is signal ratios to those of an external a linear dynamic range over four orders of magnitude and good reproducibility were we used this assay to investigate variations of il-13 mrna expression in hiv-infected patients under highly active antiretroviral we also report a variant of this method using taqman assay in the abi prism
discrimination between monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia using cycle length variability measured by wavelet transform the objective of this study was to assess the capability of wavelet transform (wt) analysis to differentiate between monomorphic (mvts) and polymorphic ventricular tachycardias (pvts) in a canine model and to relate these results to epicardial isochronal maps on a beat-by-beat unipolar electrograms were simultaneously recorded from the surface of both ventricles with a 127-lead sock electrode array in 24 open-chest anesthetized the sampling frequency was 500 atrioventricular block was induced by formaldehyde injection into the atrioventricular the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 60 minutes under ventricular pacing (140 stimuli/min) followed by ventricular tachycardias were obtained during reperfusion and during left stellate ganglion after visual a total of 97 segments of samples seconds) were extracted and classified as 67 mvts and 30 a parameter based on the cycle length variability was defined in the second scale of the wt normalized by its mean similar assessment of cycle length variability was performed based on the detection of the point of most rapid change in potential with a negative slope in excess of mv/ms in each individual electrogram to test the accuracy of the results obtained with the wt the wt parameter correctly identified 97% mvt and pvt for an overall accuracy of beat-by-beat epicardial maps of mvt displayed a cluster of sites of initial activation close to the reperfusion while the sites of breakthrough from beats during pvt were much more dispersed over both a strong and significant correlation was found between the number of electrodes with the earliest epicardial activation and the wt parameter (r = p < to test the accuracy of the results a comparison was performed between the wt parameter +/- and the cycle length estimated as the normalized standard deviation of the intervals between individual electrograms +/- no significant differences were shown (p = and a strong linear correlation was found between both measurements (pearson correlation it is concluded that wt analysis discriminated accurately between mvt and and a quantitative relation was found with the spatial dispersion of sites of earliest epicardial the wt results strongly correlated with those obtained by another method of estimating cycle length the strength of the wt lies in the complementary information that could be extracted from the processing of electrograms to enhance the detection/discrimination of different types of
interrater reliability of neurologic soft signs in an acquired brain injury to determine the interrater reliability of a battery of tests that assess for neurologic soft signs in an acquired brain injury study correlation study of the interrater inpatient and outpatient acquired brain injury rehabilitation fourteen patients with an acquired brain injury and two control the battery of tests for neurologic soft signs was administered to all 16 each subject was fifteen allied health professionals independently rated the two scoring systems were all neurologic soft signs were rated on an ordinal where a quantitative measure of performance was using the ordinal scale scoring all neurologic soft signs had interclass correlation coefficients (iccs) of > or the signs and part 1 and part achieved iccs of > or = for the scoring system requiring a quantitative measure of iccs ranged from to neurologic soft signs administered to an acquired brain injury population can be reliably rated by the signs should be rated on an ordinal
a rasch-built measure of manual to apply the rasch measurement model to the development of a clinical tool for measuring manual (dis)ability manual ability was evaluated in terms of the difficulty perceived by a hand-impaired patient on 57 representative unimanual or bimanual a clinical eighteen rheumatoid arthritis patients (14 4 men) were interviewed after wrist arthrodesis (10 4 and 4 both their ages ranged from 38 to 77 time since diagnosis ranged from 7 to 41 and time since surgery ranged from to 17 main outcome administered at a mean duration of 7 years after forty-six of the 57 items define a single manual ability continuum with widespread measurement range and regular item items relating to and dressing upper body worked consistently with their counterparts in other disability more difficult items extend the measurement range beyond that of most existing manual ability even in a small sample of using the rasch methodology enabled the investigators to produce a useful scale of manual (dis)ability and to define manual ability as a unique at least in patients with rheumatoid
