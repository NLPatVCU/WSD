subthreshold membrane resonance in neocortical using whole cell recording we studied subthreshold and suprathreshold voltage responses to oscillatory current inputs in neurons from the sensorimotor cortex of juvenile based on firing neurons were classified as regular spiking intrinsic bursting and fast spiking the subthreshold voltage-current relationships of rs and ib neurons were rectifying whereas fs neurons were almost ohmic near frequency response curves (frcs) for neurons were determined by analyzing the frequency content of inputs and the frcs of most neurons were voltage dependent at frequencies but not 20 approximately 60% of rs and ib neurons had a membrane resonance at their resting resonant frequencies were between and hz (24-26 degrees c) near -70 mv and usually increased with hyperpolarization and decreased with the remaining rs and ib neurons and all fs neurons were resonant neurons near rest had a selective coupling between oscillatory inputs and these neurons selectively fired action potentials when the frequency of the swept-sine-wave (zap) current input was near the resonant when these neurons were depolarized to -60 spike firing was associated with many input frequencies rather than selectively near the resonant we examined three subthreshold currents that could cause low-frequency a hyperpolarization-activated cation current that was blocked by external cs+ but not an instantaneously inwardly rectifying k+ current that was blocked by both cs+ and and an quickly inwardly rectifying persistent na+ current that was blocked by tetrodotoxin voltage-clamp experiments defined the relative steady state activation ranges of these iir (activates below -80 mv) and inap (activates above -65 mv) are unlikely to interact with each other because their activation ranges never both currents may interact with which activated variably at potentials between -50 and -90 mv in different we found that ih produces subthreshold consistent with subthreshold resonance was blocked by external cs+ but not ba2+ or application of ba2+ enlarged frcs and resonance at potentials below -80 indicating that normally attenuates application of ttx greatly diminished resonance at potentials more depolarized than -65 indicating that inap normally amplifies resonance at these the zap current input may be viewed as a model of oscillatory currents that arise in neocortical neurons during synchronized activity in the we propose that the frequency selectivity endowed on neurons by ih may contribute to their participation in synchronized the voltage dependence of the frequency-selective coupling between oscillatory inputs and spikes may indicate a novel mechanism for controlling the extent of low-frequency synchronized activity in the
intensive insulin therapy in clinical achieving optimal blood glucose without an unacceptable rate of hypoglycaemia or unacceptable restrictions on is not simple with presently available insulin preparations and monitoring there is considerable evidence that achieved control is relatively independent of the means or frequency of insulin delivery provided at least two injections per day are probably due to a combination of the unphysiological nature of insulin absorption the poor reproducibility of insulin absorption in any and the erratic nature of normal human accordingly the appropriate use of insulin to obtain good metabolic control requires the continued and informed expertise of both patient and advising but also attention from both to self-motivation in order to make the desired lifestyle changes newer approaches to insulin delivery will continue to demand a high level of understanding and expertise to make them until such time as automatic minute-to-minute control of insulin delivery can be
[difficulties encountered in gathering information on illegal abortion in the population of any attempt to study the practice of illegal abortion faces the problem of asking women about a sensitive issue that has many this may make it difficult to obtain truthful information on the results related to methodological aspects are emphasized and their possible association with variables included in a cross-sectional study carried out among of 15 to 49 years of age is the frequency and conditions under which induced abortion was performed in a region of paulo state are the women were interviewed at home using a structured most of the women interviewed declared they had never had an abortion nor had they thought of having and four percent referred to having had an induced another percent said that they had taken tea or medicine at least once to bring on their in this most of the women who thought they were pregnant at that time said they had had never an in spite of having bled after drinking tea or the results lead to the conclusion that women tend no omit information on the practice of abortion when questioned this is especially true of those who use oral means to bring on their menses and who seemed not to consider this a way of inducing an
standard and multifrequency tympanometry in normal and otosclerotic the primary goal of this study was to evaluate alternative tympanometric parameters for distinguishing normal middle ears from ears with a secondary goal was to provide guidelines and normative data for interpreting multifrequency tympanometry obtained using the virtual 310 immittance nine tympanometric measures were examined in 68 normal ears and 14 ears with surgically confirmed no subjects in either group had a history of head trauma or otoscopic evidence of eardrum two static admittance and tympanometric were derived from standard low-frequency tympanometry and two resonant frequency and frequency corresponding to admittance phase angle of 45 degrees (f45 were derived from multifrequency differences between normal and otosclerotic ears were statistically significant only for resonant frequency and f45 group differences in resonant frequency were larger when estimated using positive rather than negative group differences in both resonant frequency and f45 degrees were larger when estimated from sweep frequency rather than sweep test performance analysis and patterns of individual test performance point to two independent signs of otosclerosis in the patient 1) an increase in the stiffness of the middle best indexed by f45 degrees derived from sf and 2) a change in the dynamic response of the tympanic membrane/middle ear system to changes in ear canal best indexed by tympanometric most patients were correctly identified by only one of these two optimal test performance was achieved by combining f45 degrees derived from sf recordings and tympanometric the findings confirm the advantage of multifrequency tympanometry over standard low-frequency tympanometry in differentiating otosclerotic and normal recommendations for interpreting resonant frequency and f45 degrees measures obtained using the virtual immittance system are also in the relationship among different tympanometric measures suggests a general strategy for combining tympanometric measures to improve the identification of
high-frequency ultrasonic detection of thrombi with a targeted contrast site-targeted acoustic contrast agents used in conjunction with high-frequency intravascular ultrasound have the potential to localize and characterize intravascular the present study quantifies the utility of a site-targeted ultrasonic contrast agent with high-frequency ultrasound (30 to 50 mhz) and demonstrates the feasibility of the new agent for augmenting detection of targeted pathology with intravascular ultrasonic high-frequency acoustic microscopy was used to image avidinconjugated nitrocellulose membranes after exposure to a control or biotinylated contrast increases (p < in backscattered power of approximately 66 db (4-fold) were found for the but not the control contrast intravascular ultrasonic images (30 mhz nominal center frequency) of plasma clots after exposure to the targeted contrast agent were brighter (p < than in these results demonstrate high-frequency acoustic enhancement with a novel targeted contrast agent and may extend the potential diagnostic spectrum of intravascular
the effects of frequency region and bandwidth on the temporal modulation transfer temporal resolution was examined as a function of frequency region and listening the first experiment demonstrated that amplitude- and frequency-modulated tones are not appropriate stimuli to study temporal resolution as a functional of frequency due to the availability of other cues in addition to temporal in the other thresholds for detection of sinusoidal amplitude modulation of a noise band were measured as a function of frequency and level of surrounding notched noise temporal modulation transfer functions (tmtfs) measured in low- and high-frequency regions did not differ in sensitivity or in cutoff suggesting that initial filtering did not affect temporal when the upper cutoff frequency of the noise was held tmtf sensitivity increased with noise while the cutoff frequency of the tmtf did not show measurable these results are consistent with the predictions of an envelope detector model if peripheral filtering in the lower-frequency range is assumed to be approximately twice as wide as that estimated by measuring thresholds for a tone in notched restricting the listening region with notched noise increased thresholds for low modulation frequencies but not for this is consistent with other data showing that upward spread of excitation may increase the effective modulation but only for low modulation
inhibition of bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation produced by noxious cutaneous and visceral stimuli and its modulation by vagal activity [published errata appear in j neurophysiol 1998 1135 and 1998 intrathecally applied nicotine reduces bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation (bk-induced pe) in the rat knee this depression is mediated by the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis and is enhanced by interruption of impulse traffic in afferents of the abdominal vagus like intrathecal electrical stimulation of unmyelinated cutaneous fibers also depresses bk-induced which is also dependent on an intact hpa in this we investigated whether the inhibitory effect of intrathecal nicotine can be mimicked by noxious stimulation of skin and of furthermore we determined whether this depression is potentiated after subdiaphragmatic stimulation of visceral afferents in the by intraperitoneal capsaicin dose-dependently decreased bk-induced the capsaicin dose-response function was shifted by orders of magnitude to the left after stimulation of visceral afferents in the urinary bladder by capsaicin also dose-dependently reduced bk-induced which similarly was potentiated after transcutaneous stimulation of unmyelinated nociceptive afferents from the plantar skin of the paw depressed bk-induced this depression had a threshold of approximately hz and was maximal at a stimulation frequency of approximately 1 after subdiaphragmatic the stimulus response function shifted to the left and the inhibition was significantly larger than in in the range of hz these results show that noxious stimulation of skin and viscera depressed bk-induced pe and that such depression was potentiated after subdiaphragmatic vagotomy in a manner similar to that of intrathecally applied based on these we hypothesize that intrathecal nicotine depresses bk-induced pe by exciting spinal nociceptive neurons or the central projections of nociceptive primary afferent
recreation and potential the department of energy and other federal facilities are reclaiming land through the process of remediation and and this land will eventually be turned over for future land uses that may involve understanding the amount of recreation that is likely (and thus individual exposure) is an essential element in decisions about cleanup in this article the number of days people engage in different recreational activities as a measure of potential exposure is people attending a mayfest celebration (n = 399) and the palmetto classic (n = 285) in were interviewed regarding their recreational in most cases reported in the recreational activities are examined as the mean number of days people engage in each activity per but to determine risk it is essential to know the distribution of these in descending order of people attending the mayfest reported their activities as and there were significant gender differences in the frequency of with men spending more days in every activity except birdwatching and there were ethnic differences in with whites engaging in higher levels of most recreational activities than but the percentage of black men who reported fishing more than 100 d per year was greater than for white most people reported their participation in most activities less than 30 d per a higher percentage of people reported participating in and fishing more than 30 d per year compared to the other individuals at the classic reported far higher rates of hunting and fishing per year than the general these data can be used to examine potential exposure of recreationists on remediated and restored the data clearly indicate that over 25% of the people engage in at least one recreational activity over 20 d per and thus exceed the department of 14-d recreation assumption in its future land use
spontaneous mutation frequencies and spectra in p53 (+/+) and p53 (-/-) a test of the of the hypothesis in the big blue transgenic mouse mutation detection tsg-p53/big blue double transgenic mice offer a powerful tool for examining the effect of a p53 germline mutation on spontaneous somatic mutation in after sequencing the dna-binding domain of the laci we previously reported no differences in mutant frequency between p53 nullizygous (-/-) and p53 wild-type (+/+) mice in spleen and jackpot mutations elsewhere in the gene may have obscured a real difference in mutation frequency and the small sample size of mutations not at cpg dinucleotides (n = 23) may have been insufficient to reveal differences in mutation herein we have sequenced the entire laci including the promoter and lacz operator 123 additional independent mutations have been found including 70 mutations not at cpg the mutation frequency was determined by correcting for jackpot there were no statistically significant differences in mutation frequency or spectrum between the p53 (+/+) and p53 (-/-) genotypes in any of the three
effect of tidal volume and frequency on airway responsiveness in mechanically ventilated we evaluated the effects of the rate and volume of tidal ventilation on airway resistance (raw) during intravenous methacholine (mch) challenge in mechanically ventilated five rabbits were challenged at tidal volumes of and 20 ml/kg at a frequency of 15 breaths/min and also under static conditions (0 ml/kg tidal four rabbits were subjected to mch challenge at frequencies of 6 and 30 breaths/min with a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg and also under static in both the increase in raw with mch challenge was significantly greater under static conditions than during tidal ventilation at any frequency or increases in the volume or frequency of tidal ventilation resulted in significant decreases in raw in response to we conclude that tidal breathing suppresses airway responsiveness in rabbits in the suppression of narrowing in response to mch increases as the magnitude of the volume or the frequency of the tidal oscillations is our findings suggest that the effect of lung volume changes on airway responsiveness in vivo is primarily related to the stretch of airway smooth
noise suppression digital filter for functional magnetic resonance imaging based on image reference the central decision in every functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) experiment is whether pixels in brain tissues are showing activation in response to neural stimulus or as a result of images are degraded not only by random thermal) but also by structured noise due to mr system cardiac and respiratory and patient a novel digital filter has been developed to suppress cardiac and respiratory structured noise in fmri using estimates of structured and random noise power spectra obtained directly from the it is an adaptive filter based on stationary noise and is equivalent in form to a wiener a mathematical model of the filtering process was developed to understand how the strength and distribution of structured and random noise power influenced filter the filter was tested using images from an auditory activation study in ten in subjects whose structured noise power was localized to a relatively narrow frequency a strong relationship was both experimentally (r = p < for r = 0) and using the between filter performance and the level of structured noise power contaminating the experiment the filter significantly reduced the rate of false-positive activations in the subset of subjects whose experiment frequency was relatively heavily contaminated by structured notch that simply eliminate unwanted performed poorly in all unlike the proposed wiener these filters did not suppress structured noise power at the experiment frequency that contributes to false-positive
multidimensional scaling of complex sounds by school-aged children and a paired-comparisons procedure was used to evaluate the processing of nonspeech sounds by 7- and 10-year-old children and stimuli were brief duration and included pure harmonic and bands of from their similarity a three-dimensional multidimensional scaling solution was results suggested that listeners classified the stimuli into clusters based upon periodicity and the number of spectral within each the stimuli were ordered according to because individual differences in the overall weightings of features were separate solutions were derived for two subgroups of formed based upon similarities in the pattern of dimension weights obtained in the group one for whom the full group analysis captured a large proportion of the variance in the included the many of the and a few of the the solution derived for this subgroup suggested that spectral and temporal information were weighted equally and integrated into all dimension frequency information was coded but given less weight and was not used for stimulus a second subgroup of listeners included most of the 7-year-old and some of the 10-year-old examination of their data suggested that they relied heavily on an analysis of the signals according to periodicity as was reflected in their temporal fine also encoded but of lesser importance were aspects of spectral shape and absolute
phenylephrine-induced ca2+ oscillations in canine pulmonary artery smooth muscle modulation of [ca2+]i in response to receptor activation is a critical determinant of vascular smooth muscle in this we examined the effect of continuous stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors with phenylephrine (pe) on [ca2+]i in single pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (pasmcs) cultured from explants of canine intrapulmonary fura 2-loaded pasmcs pretreated with propranolol (5 mumol/l) were continuously superfused with pe at 37 degrees c on the stage of an inverted fluorescence and [ca2+]i was measured using a dual-wavelength resting values of [ca2+]i were 96 +/- 4 pe (10 mumol/l) stimulated oscillations in [ca2+]i at a frequency of +/- which reached a peak [ca2+]i of 650 +/- 26 nmol/l (n = 69 the oscillations lasted for > 30 minutes and were constant in amplitude and both the amplitude and frequency of pe-induced [ca2+]i oscillations increased in a dose-dependent (3 x 10(-8) to 10(-4) mol/l) pretreatment with the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (50 nmol/l) or removal of extracellular ca2+ abolished the repetitive [ca2+]i oscillations induced by the voltage-operated ca2+ channel blockers nifedipine (1 mumol/l) and verapamil (1 mumol/l) had no effect on the [ca2+]i in inhibition of phospholipase c with u73122 (10(-7) to 10(-5) mol/l) attenuated the oscillations in a dose-dependent the nonselective protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/l) had a minimal inhibitory effect on the caffeine (30 mmol/l) and thapsigargin (1 mumol/l) abolished the whereas pretreatment with ryanodine (1 to 100 mumol/l) had no in freshly dispersed pe (10 mumol/l) induced oscillations in [ca2+]i similar to those observed in cultured and patch-clamp experiments revealed oscillations in membrane these results indicate that pe induces [ca2+]i oscillations in pasmcs via stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors coupled to phospholipase c voltage-operated ca2+ channels and protein kinases are not required for the the requirement for extracellular ca2+ and intracellular ca2+ stores indicates that both ca2+ influx and intracellular ca2+ release play a role in the maintenance of the

detection of increments and decrements in sinusoids as a function of and decrement duration and pedestal thresholds for the detection of increments and decrements in level of 70 db spl sinusoidal signals were measured as a function signal duration or 200 pedestal duration before the signal (10 200 or pedestal on continuously) and frequency or 4000 the sinusoids were presented in a low-pass filtered background noise with an overall level of 68-69 db spl which had two (1) to mask spectral (2) to induce an adaptation which caused the continuous 4000-hz pedestal (but not the other two pedestals) to decay to inaudibility we were particularly interested in determining whether the difference in noise-induced adaptation across frequency would influence the pattern of seven normal-hearing subjects were thresholds improved with increasing frequency and with increasing duration for both increments and the effect of increment/decrement duration decreased with increasing at 4000 hz thresholds were almost the same for increment durations of 10 and 20 the energy of the increments at threshold increased markedly with increasing increment duration (especially from 20 to 200 suggesting a dominant role for the onsets of the increments as opposed to ongoing differences in increasing the pedestal duration before the increment from 10 to 200 ms slightly improved thresholds for increment and decrement durations of 10 and 20 increment thresholds were similar for the gated and continuous pedestals at all even though the 4000-hz continuous pedestal decayed to thresholds for 200-ms increments were somewhat lower for continuous than for gated and supplementary experiments found a larger gated-continuous difference for pedestals presented in making the pedestal continuous adversely affected performance for the 10- and 20-ms but not for the 200-ms we suggest that the results for decrement detection may be affected by neural long-term although they are not clearly related to loudness
invasive hemodynamics and force-frequency relationships in open- versus closed-chest we compared ventricular and force-frequency relationships in six open-chest and six closed-chest anesthetized mice (fvb/n left ventricular (lv) pressure was measured with a or millar catheter placed via the right carotid artery and the lv apex in the closed- and open-chest pacing was performed with electrodes placed either directly on atrial appendages (open chest) or with a 1-fr bipolar catheter via the jugular vein (closed closed-chest animals had greater spontaneous heart rate (267 +/- 106 147 +/- 27 lv systolic (81 +/- 14 48 +/- 9 mmhg) and diastolic pressures +/- +/- and maximal rise (+ +/- +/- 671 mmhg/s) and fall in pressure development +/- +/- 399 lv systolic pressure (98 +/- 18 52 +/- 11 + dp/dtmax +/- +/- and -dp/dtmax +/- +/- mmhg/s) were significantly higher when animals were matched at a heart rate of 420 beats/min in closed-chest open-chest biphasic force-frequency relationships were seen in all but the critical heart rate was greater in the closed- than open-chest animals (432 +/- 42 318 +/- 42 we conclude that 1) there are significant differences between invasive indexes of systolic and diastolic function between the closed- and open-chest 2) there is a biphasic force-frequency relationship in the anesthetized and 3) dp/dtmax can be used to assess the cardiovascular
clinical significance of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in young individuals during orthodontic a 3-year longitudinal the aim of the present study (1) to assess longitudinally the occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) in young subjects wearing fixed orthodontic appliances compared to matched appliance-free (2) to determine whether the presence of the micro-organism at baseline could influence the periodontal status assessed 3 years 70 27 male and 43 aged between 12 and 20 years participated in the 35 subjects under orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances for at least 6 and 35 appliance-free individuals matched for age and all subjects were free of clinically demonstrable loss of they all received oral hygiene instructions 2x during the 2 months preceding the first clinical and microbiological no subgingival instrumentation was performed between baseline and the 3-year clinical parameters included gingival bleeding index pocket probing depth (ppd) and measurements of attachment level statistically significant differences were reported regarding frequency of detection of aa between both groups at each the %s of orthodontic subjects infected with aa at the baseline and at the 3-year examination were 86% and while the corresponding figures for control subjects were and the frequency distribution of %s of aa in the total anaerobic subgingival flora among control subjects remained fairly whereas the proportion of orthodontic subjects yielding aa at a concentration > or = dropped significantly from 32% at baseline to 19% at the 3-year calculations of the relative risk for increasing gbi and ppd in both groups when aa was present at revealed that the orthodontic subjects positive for aa had a negligible relative risk of experiencing worse periodontal conditions compared to orthodontic patients where aa was not detected at in control subjects initially infected with aa presented with a risk for increased gbi higher than that for subjects without in the present study confirmed previous cross-sectional findings reporting that young individual with an integer periodontium wearing fixed orthodontic appliances harbor aa with a statistically significant greater frequency than appliance-free matched although orthodontic patients exhibited more their deteriorated clinical conditions could not be accounted for by the sole presence of aa in their in appliance-free young subjects initially infected with aa had a higher risk of experiencing more gingival inflammation than subjects without the bacterium during a 3-year observation

risk factors associated with chronic hepatitis c virus limited frequency of an unidentified source of transmission [see risk factors have been studied in patients with acute non-b and approximately 40-50% have no known risk factor for viral a significant undefined source of viral transmission has been we sought to clearly delineate the risk factors in a population of patients with documented chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection to assess the magnitude of hcv transmission without known risk risk factor profiles were carefully assessed in 301 consecutive patients with chronic hcv patients were classified by gender and overall risk factor distributions were calculated and comparisons were made between groups to detect differences in mode of hcv one hundred ninety-six men and 105 women were 223 were age < or = 45 yr and 78 were > 45 25% of patients had a history of transfusion and 49% had a history of intravenous drug use only 12% had no history of risk factor men were more likely to have a history of and less likely to have a history of blood transfusion or sexual exposure/household younger patients were more likely to have a history of and older patients were more likely to have a history of blood transfusion and to deny all risk factor a careful history delineated a potential risk factor for hcv acquisition in 88% of patients with chronic hcv men and younger patients had different risk factor profiles than women and older it is likely that an important unknown mode of hcv transmission occurs in a significant minority of
continuous subcutaneous waking day apomorphine in the long term treatment of levodopa induced interdose dyskinesias in to determine whether continuous waking day dopaminergic stimulation with the dopamine agonist apomorphine can reduce levodopa induced dyskinesias in disease 19 patients with severe unpredictable refractory motor fluctuations and functionally disabling levodopa induced dyskinesias were treated with continuous subcutaneous apomorphine monotherapy for a minimum duration of years a mean 65% reduction in dyskinetic severity and a mean 85% reduction in frequency and duration on discontinuing levodopa a concomitant reduction in off period time was also seen (35% of waking day reduced to 10%) continuous waking day dopaminergic stimulation with apomorphine reset the threshold for dyskinesias and led to a pronounced reduction in their apomorphine should be considered as a less invasive alternative to pallidotomy or deep cerebral stimulation in controlling levodopa induced interdose dose
clonal overexpression of metallothionein is induced by somatic mutation in morphologically normal colonic metallothionein (mt) overexpression occurs frequently in human tumours but the underlying mechanism is morphologically normal-appearing mucosa from human colorectal carcinoma resection specimens and of the colons of ageing laboratory mice contains scattered single crypts whose cells show uniformly increased mt suggesting that mt overexpression arises directly from random crypt stem cell somatic followed by colonization of the clonal unit by the mutated this hypothesis has now been tested by quantifying the frequency of immunocytochemically detectable monocryptal colorectal mt 5 and 30 days after injection of 8-week-old mice with a single dose of the mutagen dimethylhydrazine 30 mg/kg otherwise normal-appearing mt-positive crypts were recorded as either wholly or partially involved by the overexpressing five days after dmh the median frequency of partially involved mt-positive crypts was x declining significantly to x 10(-4) at 30 days (mann-whitney p < in the median frequency of wholly involved crypts was x 10(-4) at 5 increasing significantly (p < to x 10(-4) at 30 the frequency of mt-positive crypts and the time course of evolution of partially involved to wholly involved forms were similar to those described for mutation-induced crypt-restricted loss of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in mice treated with an identical dmh the findings indicate that cellular mt overexpression can occur as a direct consequence of somatic either cis-activating mutation(s) of the mt gene or trans-activating mutation(s) of other genes involved in controlling mt this is likely to be an important mechanism underlying mt overexpression in such mutation-induced aberrant mt expression may be involved in the acquisition of selective cellular growth of survival advantage during tumour
modeling interaural-delay sensitivity to frequency modulation at high interaural-delay sensitivity to high-frequency (> or = 3 khz) sinusoidal-frequency-modulated (sfm) tones is examined for rates from 25 to 800 hz and depths of -12 to 18 comparison is made to thresholds obtained for sinusoidal-amplitude-modulated (sam) tones for the same observers and modulation both sam and sfm threshold-by-rate functions are u-shaped with optimum sensitivity to sfm tones occurring at higher rates (fm = 200-400 hz) compared to those for sam tones (fm = 100-200 effects of modulation depth were examined for rates from 50 to 300 in all cases thresholds improved considerably with increasing modulation it is also shown that a hybrid dichotic signal composed of an sfm tone presented to one ear and an sam tone to the can perceptually fuse and be with the contingency that both stimuli have equal modulation rates but not necessarily equal carrier using bandpass noise to restrict off-frequency it was shown that for this observers can use information from filters either below or above the carrier consistent with fm-to-am conversion from cochlear bandpass several important differences between the sam- and sfm-tone data can be predicted from a nonstationary stochastic model of binaural interaction whose parameters are uniquely determined from the sam-tone

sudden changes in spectrum of an echo cause a breakdown of the precedence the effect of changing the frequency components of an echo relative to the sound source was examined in a two-choice discrimination subjects sat in an anechoic chamber and discriminated the direction of the lag noise burst within a lead-lag pair presented over the leading noise burst was and the lagging burst was either high- or low-pass on some this test burst pair was preceded by a conditioning train of burst which also had a broadband lead and either a high- or low-frequency when the frequency content of the echo was held constant across the conditioning train and test burst echo suppression that was built up during the repeating train was maintained for the test burst shown by the poor performance in detecting the location of the lagging by subjects had little difficulty in localizing the lagging burst when the frequency content of the echo changed between the conditioning train and the test indicating that any buildup of suppression during the train was broken when the lagging spectrum the data are consistent with an interpretation in which echo suppression is temporarily broken when built-up expectations about room acoustics are
sequence context profoundly influences the mutagenic potency of trans-opened benzo[a]pyrene nucleoside adducts in site-specific mutation the postoligomerization method was used to prepare oligonucleotide 16-mers that contained dado or dguo derived from trans opening of each enantiomer of the two diastereomeric benzo[a]pyrene in two sequence these 16 along with the four corresponding oligonucleotides containing unsubstituted were ligated into single-stranded dna from bacteriophage m13mp7l2 and transfected into escherichia coli the mutagenic effects of replication past these adducts were then the various adduct isomers induced point mutations at different frequencies and with different distributions of mutation as was sequence context had the most substantial effects on mutation a high frequency of deletions of a single guanine was found in a context where the dguo adduct was at the of a run of five whereas no single base deletion was found in the other context mutation frequencies in constructs containing dado adducts were much higher in a context depending on the individual isomer) than in a context and for a given mutation frequency was up to 10-fold higher in the former sequence than in the these findings indicate that sequence context effects need more thorough evaluation if the goal of understanding the mechanism through which dna adducts lead to mutation is to be
functional specialization in auditory responses to frequency-modulated stimuli in the posterior auditory the mammalian auditory cortex contains multiple fields but their functional role is poorly here we examine the responses of single neurons in the posterior auditory field (p) of barbiturate- and ketamine-anesthetized cats to frequency-modulated (fm) fm sweeps traversed the excitatory response area of the neuron under and fm direction and the linear rate of change of frequency (rcf) were varied in some sweeps of different sound pressure levels (spls) also were the response magnitude (number of spikes corrected for spontaneous activity) of nearly all field p neurons varied with rcf response functions displayed a variety of but most functions were of low-pass characteristic or peaked at rather low rcfs (<100 neurons with strong responses to high rcfs (high-pass or nonselective rcf response function characteristics) all displayed spike count-spl functions to tone burst onsets that were monotonic or weakly rcf response functions and best rcfs often changed with for most fm directional quantified by a directional sensitivity (ds) also varied with rcf and but the mean and width of the distribution of ds indices across all neurons was independent of analysis of response timing revealed that the phasic response of a neuron is triggered when the instantaneous frequency of the sweep reaches a particular the effective for a given values of effective fi were independent of but depended on fm direction and spl and were associated closely with the boundaries of the frequency versus amplitude response the standard deviation (sd) of the latency of the first spike of the response decreased with when sd was expressed relative to the rate of change of stimulus the resulting index of frequency jitter increased with rcf and did so rather uniformly in all neurons and largely independent of these properties suggest that many fm parameters are represented and may be encoded orderly temporal patterns across different neurons in addition to the strength of when compared with neurons in primary and anterior auditory field p neurons respond better to relatively slow together with previous studies of responses to modulations of such as tone our findings suggest more generally that field p may be best suited for processing signals that vary relatively slowly over

beneficial effect of a bile acid resin binder on enteral feeding induced diarrhea is a complication of enteral occurring in up to 68% of critically ill we hypothesized that prolonged fasting results in abnormal bile acid subsequent enteral feeding then causes a relative luminal excess of bile which leads to choleretic diarrhea induced by enteral feeding should improve with the use of a bile acid binding such as colestid we evaluated the effect of colestid on enteral feeding-induced diarrhea in a double-blind placebo-controlled nineteen patients who were nil per os (npo) for 5 days before initiation of enteral feeding were enrolled in the study and treatment continued for 7 the severity and frequency of diarrhea were fecal bile acids were measured stool nutrient loss was measured by fat microkjeldahl determination of and bomb calorimetry of dried fecal enteral feeding resulted in a high frequency of diarrhea (95%) at some time during the observation the majority of episodes of diarrhea in both groups were of low colestid significantly decreased the prevalence and severity of colestid had no significant effect on fecal calorie or nutrient the average bile acid concentration in the stool increased significantly after enteral enteral feeding-induced diarrhea at least in due to malabsorption of bile the bile acid resin binding agent colestid improves diarrhea induced by enteral
elevated serum levels of soluble fas/apo-1 (cd95) in patients with hepatocellular fas (apo-1/cd95)-mediated apoptosis plays an important role in liver cell destruction in viral using sandwich we measured serum levels of soluble fas (sfas) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) who were positive for hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) or anti-hepatitis c virus (hcv) sfas levels were significantly higher in hcc patients (median range ng/ml) than levels in age-matched healthy donors ng/ ml) (p < and hbsag or anti-hcv antibody-positive patients with liver cirrhosis (lc) ng/ ng/ml) (p = an arbitrary cut-off level of ng/ml (mean + 3 of controls) revealed the positive frequency of sfas in each in healthy in and in hcc (sensitivity and specificity all hcc sera tested contained transmembrane-deleted sfas and some contained another sfas lacking the fas the positive frequency of either sfas or alpha-fetoprotein (afp) in hcc patients reached hcc patients with multiple tumour foci ng/ml) had significantly higher sfas levels than did patients with a solitary tumour ng/ml) (p = in all of the sfas-positive patients with a solitary surgical removal of the tumour reduced sfas levels to the negative in the first post-op these findings suggest that sfas may be closely linked with hcc and may be a candidate for a clinical parameter for
stressful life events and personality relation to impairment and treatment outcome in patients with social forty-five patients with social phobia and 15 individuals with no mental disorder were compared on number and type of life events social phobia patients were further examined to evaluate the effect of negative life events and of the interaction between personality style and life events on severity of impairment and reactions to cognitive-behavioral group patients with social phobia reported more negative life events than participants with no mental among patients with social more frequent negative life events were associated with higher scores on measures of depression and general patients high on autonomy who reported more negative autonomous achievement-oriented) life events also scored higher on measures of social anxiety and general there were no significant interactions between sociotropy and the frequency of reported socially oriented negative life patients high on sociotropy scored higher on measures of social and general patients who had experienced more negative life events improved more after treatment on measures of social anxiety than did those who had experienced fewer negative life implications of these findings and recommendations for future research are
targeted disruption of the bradyzoite-specific gene bag1 does not prevent tissue cyst formation in toxoplasma expression of the 30 kda small heat shock protein bag1 is restricted to the latent bradyzoite form of toxoplasma first appearing approximately 2-3 days after the initiation of bradyzoite although developmental expression of small heat shock proteins has been described for many their precise function is in order to examine the function of bag1 in gondii bradyzoites and its role during parasite we have used homologous recombination to produce a knock-out mutant in the cyst-forming strain a clonal derivative of under tissue culture conditions that stimulate bradyzoite differentiation (alkaline the mutant was found to express several bradyzoite-specific markers with the same kinetics and frequency as the parental neither enhanced nor decreased susceptibility to stress was observed for the bag1-deficient in vivo studies revealed that tachyzoites of the bag1 knock-out mutant were fully able to establish a chronic infection in c57bl/6 producing brain cysts of a morphology and frequency indistinguishable from cysts formed by the parental control brain cysts of the bag1 knock-out mutant contained viable parasites capable of establishing an acute infection after oral demonstrating that conversion of bradyzoites to tachyzoites is also we conclude that bag1 is not essential for normal function of bradyzoite containing tissue at least in intermediate host this clone of p(lk) was found to be unable to produce oocysts and is therefore unsuitable for studies in

the tension-time index and the frequency/tidal volume ratio are the major pathophysiologic determinants of weaning failure and we have previously shown care that in patients needing mechanical the load imposed on the inspiratory muscles is excessive relative to their neuromuscular we have therefore hypothesized that weaning failure may occur because at the time of the trial of spontaneous breathing there is insufficient reduction of the inspiratory we therefore prospectively studied patients who initially had failed to wean from mechanical ventilation (f) but had successful weaning (s) on a later compared with during f patients had greater intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure 10 +/- versus +/- cm dynamic hyperinflation (327 +/- 180 versus 213 +/- 175 total resistance +/- versus +/- cm ratio of mean to maximum inspiratory pressure +/- versus +/- tension time index +/- versus +/- and power (315 +/- 153 versus 215 +/- 75 cm h2o x less maximum inspiratory pressure +/- versus +/- cm and a breathing pattern that was more rapid and shallow (ratio of frequency to tidal f/vt 98 +/- 38 versus 62 +/- 21 to clarify on pathophysiologic grounds what determines inability to wean from mechanical we performed multiple logistic regression analysis with the weaning outcome as the dependent the tti and the f/vt ratio were the only significant variables in the we conclude that the tti and the f/vt are the major pathophysiologic determinants underlying the transition from weaning failure to weaning
stress during labor and delivery and early lactation the amount of stress experienced by both the mother and fetus during labor and delivery varies considerably and is likely to be different in primiparous and multiparous in this study we explored relations between the birth experience and lactation performance of 40 stress hormones were measured in serum or plasma during parturition (cord and maternal and milk samples were obtained and breast-feeding frequency was recorded each day during the first 2 wk four outcomes were used as markers of the time when the subject first felt fullness in the 24-h milk volume on day 5 milk lactose concentration on day and the day of appearance of casein in the milk as determined by gel there were significant intercorrelations among the outcome except for milk compared with multiparous primiparous mothers experienced a delay in breast fullness and lower milk volume on day in multiple regression analyses excluding subjects who had cesarean deliveries (n = markers of both fetal and maternal stress during labor and delivery (cord glucose concentration and maternal exhaustion score) were associated with delayed breast fullness and casein delayed casein appearance was also associated independently with a longer duration of milk volume on day 5 was lower in women with higher exhaustion in multiparous those who breast-fed less frequently on day the milk lactose concentration was inversely related to pregnancy weight these results indicate that long stress to the mother and fetus during labor and and elevated cord glucose concentrations are risk factors for delayed
