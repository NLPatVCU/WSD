in situ evaluation of esterase stereoselectivity in two-dimensional electropherograms and tissue staining with both enantiomers of an alpha-naphthyl ester plus a diazonium salt and comparing the color intensities given by the two enantiomers is a convenient method to evaluate the esterase stereoselectivity for that ester in two-dimensional electropherograms and tissue application of this method for rat liver has shown that (1) several one of pi and mr 118 are moderately stereoselective against alpha-naphthyl (r)-n-acetylalaninate and (r)-n-methoxycarbonylalaninate but strictly stereoselective against alpha-naphthyl implying that esterase stereoselectivity may be inverted by changing the ester and (2) these esterases are mainly contained in the hepatocytes around central
[erectile psychological diagnosis and for clinical erectile dysfunction is the most important form of male sexual in the majority of patients causation and course of their erectile disorder is determined by a close interplay of somatic and psychosocial this psychosomatic interaction has to be taken into account during diagnostic assessment and the old dichotomous concepts (psychogenic versus organic) of erectile dysfunction have to be replaced by multidimensional models that include dispositonal as well as chronifying the main causes of psychogenic erectile disorders can be divided into three each belonging to a different phase of immediate factors (performance antecedent life events from recent developmental vulnerabilities from childhood and the most important instrument for the psychological evaluation of sexually dysfunctional patients is a comprehensive sexual history in which partner related aspects should be particularly in treating psychogenic erectile dysfunctions sex therapy is a reliable and efficient treatment option with a reasonably good long-term in sex therapy should be combined with somatic treatment options to reach a truly integrative approach to this complex

the effect of investigator compliance (observer bias) on calculated efficacy in a pertussis vaccine in the course of a large pertussis vaccine efficacy trial we realized that investigator compliance could have a major impact on calculated vaccine in our pertussis vaccine efficacy the study investigators were to monitor illness in study families by telephone every 2 if a cough illness of >/=7 days duration was the study child was to be if the cough illness persisted for >/=14 the child was to be referred to a central for this report we analyzed study physician evaluation rates and rates of referral to the central physician practices were separated into three compliance and we analyzed vaccine efficacy of an acellular pertussis component dtp vaccine (dtap) and a whole cell pertussis component dtp vaccine (dtp) by compliance bordetella pertussis infection was documented by culture of the organism in the study child or in a household contact or by a significant antibody response to pertussis toxin determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent using a clinical case definition that included both mild and typical pertussis (cough illness >/=7 days duration) efficacy of dtap vaccine was 40% (95% confidence interval [ci] = -3-65) in the high compliance category and 78% (95% ci = 65-86) and 75% (95% ci = 53-87) in the intermediate and low compliance but less differences in efficacy were noted with dtp vaccine using a clinical case definition that required >/=21 days of cough with or vomiting (typical pertussis) the efficacy of dtap vaccine was 69% (95% ci = 41-83) in the high compliance category and 86% (95% ci = 76-92) and 84% (95% ci = 64-93) in the intermediate and low compliance in the efficacy of dtp vaccine did not vary by compliance category using this case the attack rate in children vaccinated with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids vaccine (dt) was twofold less in low compliance physician practices when compared with the rates in high and intermediate the dt/dtap and dt/dtp fold-change differences were less in the high compliance group compared with the intermediate and low compliance our data suggest that observer compliance (observer can significantly inflate calculated vaccine it is likely that all recently completed efficacy trials have been effected by this type of observer bias and all vaccines have considerably less efficacy against mild disease than published data
