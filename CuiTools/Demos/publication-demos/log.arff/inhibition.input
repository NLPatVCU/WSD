cytokine-mediated antitumor effect of ok-432 on urinary bladder tumor cells in fatal complications from the intravesical instillation of bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg) for the treatment of superficial urinary bladder tumors have been an immunomodulating agent like may be an effective and safe agent for the treatment of urinary bladder we investigated the cytokine-mediated antitumor effect of ok-432 on established human bladder cancer cell lines (t24 and kk-47) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from a healthy volunteer were cultured with ok-432 for various and the culture supernatants were used as conditioned cytokines in the culture supernatants were the antitumor effect of ok-432 was evaluated by colony-forming using the conditioned media as the culture the colony survival of t24 and kk-47 cells was significantly inhibited by conditioned media from 24-h cultures of pbmcs incubated with ok-432 at concentrations of and klinische einheit conditioned media from pbmcs cultivated with ok-432 for 7 days at and ke/ml also significantly inhibited the colony survival of both cell higher concentrations of interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf alpha) were detected in conditioned media cultivated with ok-432 for 24 h than in media from pbmcs higher concentrations of interferon gamma (ifn gamma) were detected in conditioned media cultivated with ok-432 for 7 approximately 90% of the inhibition of kk-47 cells by the 24-h conditioned media was neutralized by an anti-tnf monoclonal the inhibition of t24 cells was neutralized approximately 50% by the same the inhibition of t24 and kk-47 cells by 7-day conditioned media was completely neutralized by an anti-ifn gamma monoclonal the cultivation of pbmcs with ok-432 inhibited the production of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (g-csf) by the inhibition may play a role in the mechanism of the antitumor effect of urinary bladder tumor cell lines have different sensitivities to the cytokines induced by ok-432 vary with the concentration of ok-432 and the culture it is suggested that in intravesical instillation of ok-432 for treatment of urinary bladder the optimal dose and interval of instillation should be
inhibition of gibberellin biosynthesis by nitrate in gibberella gibberellin production in gibberella fujikuroi starts upon exhaustion of the nitrogen to determine the role of nitrate and ammonium in the regulation of gibberellin biosynthesis we have isolated mutants that cannot use nitrate as a nitrogen nitrate inhibited partially the production of gibberellins in mutants devoid of nitrate reductase the inhibition occurred whether nitrate was added before or after the onset of gibberellin addition of tungstate to the wild type mimicked the results with nitrate reductase we conclude that nitrate inhibits gibberellin biosynthesis by independently of the intracellular signal that conveys nitrogen
b cell activation and especially production is inhibited by high cd23 levels in vivo and in the capacity of cd23 to regulate ige production was evaluated in both an in vitro and an in vivo the decreased ige response seen in cd23 transgenic mice was confirmed and observed to occur at all antigen doses in purified b cells from the tg animals in general exhibited lower ige production when stimulated with cd40l and to examine this down-regulating activity of cd23 an in vitro model system was cho cells were transfected with or both cd23 and icam-1 was chosen to enhance b cell-b cell purified resting b cells were placed into culture with the mitomycin c-treated transfected or control cho cells and activated with and a dose-dependent decrease in ige production was observed with increasing cell numbers of the cho transfectants that expressed the effect lasted up to day 3 of b cell proliferation was also inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by increasing numbers of cd23-expressing cells suggesting a potential effect of cd23 on b cell in icam-1-transfected or cho control cells had minimal effects on either ig production or b cell while ige production was inhibited up to 95% by high numbers of cd23-transfected cho some inhibition of igg and igm production was also the mechanism of cd23-mediated inhibition of ige production was compared with the inhibition in ige production seen when b cell were coactivated with multivalent anti-igd in conjunction with cd40l plus optimal to this end we used rt-pcr to compare the relative levels of epsilon-germline transcripts in control cultures and cultures coactivated by and il-5 or activated in the presence of high levels of cd23-expressing cd22 was used as an internal standard since levels change little with b cell coactivation strongly inhibited epsilon-germline transcript levels but the presence of cd23-expressing cells did coactivation potentially operates prior to isotype while high cd23 coculture blocks either recombination or more likely b cell differentiation to high ig producers our data support the hypothesis that il-4 induces both ige and a controlling agent for
r-flurbiprofen chemoprevention and treatment of intestinal adenomas in the apc(min)/+ mouse implications for prophylaxis and treatment of colon we used the c57bl/6j-apc(min)/+ mouse (min mouse) to evaluate the chemopreventive effects of r-flurbiprofen the noncyclooxygenase-inhibiting enantiomer of weanling min mice were administered 6 weeks of oral treatment with r-fb using mg/kg of r-fb once per day mg/kg of r-fb twice per day and 5 mg/kg of r-fb challenged with a high saturated fat at necropsy we determined tumor and ulcer tumor and plasma levels of r- and a linear dose response was observed from to 10 mg/kg of regardless of whether the drug was administered as a single or divided reductions in tumor number were significant (p < or = for doses of r-fb from to 25 a dose of 5 mg/kg r-fb was able to overcome the doubling in tumor number associated with the high saturated fat at 20 and 25 mg/kg/day we obtained the maximum response with up to 90% inhibition of total tumor at these there was toxicity and animal this toxicity was associated with presumably resulting from the in vivo epimerization of r- to s-fb that occurs in the we evaluated the oral pharmacokinetics of r-fb and its conversion to s-fb in wild-type these kinetics experiments revealed inversion rates of and for the and 10 mg/kg r-fb s-fb administered alone and mg/kg in doses mimicking the concentrations of s-fb associated with the r to s epimerization of the doses of r-fb used in our had little or no antitumor efficacy (p > we conclude that r-fb not the s-fb resulting from epimerization in the inhibits adenoma formation in the min in where there is no r to s it is possible that larger doses of r-fb can be used without causing cyclooxygenase inhibition and its resulting ulcerogenicity and other side to assess the effect of r-fb on established we allowed 40 min mice to remain untreated until 70 days of age (the time of necropsy in the previous experiments) and then treated them for an additional 42 days with 10 mg/kg r-fb or 5 mg/kg r-fb both drug-treated groups demonstrated tumor numbers significantly less than that of the vehicle control (p < our results suggest that prophylaxis and treatment trials of r-fb should be extended to
angiotensin ii-receptor blockade further reduces afterload safely in patients maximally treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for heart combined therapy with an angiotensin-ii type i receptor (at1) antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor results in more complete suppression of the renin-angiotensin the blood-pressure response and safety of combining at1-receptor blockade with losartan for ace inhibition were evaluated in patients with congestive heart failure who were already treated with maximally recommended or tolerated doses of an ace forty-three patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure were evaluated biweekly for 1 month before addition of losartan and weekly during administration of losartan at a daily dose of 25 mg for the first week and 50 mg for the second systolic blood which remained unchanged before addition of decreased from 122 +/- 18 mm hg to 112 +/- 17 and 107 +/- 17 mm hg (p < after 1 week of 25 mg and 1 week of 50 mg diastolic blood pressure also significantly the decreases in blood pressure were well tolerated by all even by those in whom symptomatic hypotension developed during uptitration of ace serum potassium and sodium and parameters of renal function remained combining at1-receptor blockade with losartan to maximally recommended or tolerated ace inhibition appears safe and leads to further vasodilatation in symptomatic patients with congestive heart
gastrin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate regulate the human histidine decarboxylase promoter through raf-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-related signaling pathways in gastric cancer gastrin stimulates transcription of the human histidine decarboxylase (hdc) gene through binding to the g-protein-coupled cholecystokinin-b/gastrin we have explored the possibility that mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades play a role in mediating the effects of gastrin on transcription in a gastric cancer (ags-b) cell gastrin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (pma) treatment of ags-b cells was found to increase the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (erks) 1 and 2 and increase erk activity as determined by the in vitro phosphorylation of myelin basic reporter gene assays also demonstrated that gastrin and pma stimulated elk-1- and c-myc-dependent consistent with gastrin- and pma-induced activation of overexpression of wild type erk-1 and erk-2 or activation of endogenous erks using activated mek-1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase or erk kinase) overexpression stimulated hdc promoter activity in a dose-dependent interruption of the erk-related pathway using expression vectors for kinase-deficient erks or an erk-specific phosphatase (pac-1) blocked gastrin- and pma-stimulated hdc promoter in inhibition of the jun kinase pathway using an interfering dominant negative sek-1 (stress-activated protein kinase/erk-1) mutant did not inhibit hdc promoter whereas gastrin stimulated phosphorylation of shc proteins and association with activation of the hdc promoter was not influenced by expression of dominant negative ras (n15 or n17) gastrin stimulated raf-1 kinase and activation of the hdc promoter was blocked by coexpression of a dominant negative raf-1 these data demonstrate that gastrin regulates hdc transcription in a ras-independent fashion predominantly through activation of the erk-related
prolactin is an autocrine growth factor for the jurkat human t-leukemic cell despite convincing evidence of cooperation between il-2 and endogenous prolactin (prl) during t cell the individual role of prl as a t-cell lineage cytokine remains to be we have examined the production and function of prl on the jurkat human t-leukemic cell which does not constitutively produce the majority of jurkat cells expressed prl receptor (r) under standard culture whereas appearance of the alpha chain of the il-2-r required pha-pma as did il-2 western blotting revealed a predominant band at kda and a weaker band at kda in both jurkat cell lysates and human (h) pituitary metabolic labeling of the cell lysates with 35s-methionine and immunoprecipitation with an antiserum against hprl showed that both forms of prl are actively synthesized by the jurkat cell prl released in the medium was biologically active in the rat nb2 lymphoma mitogenic depletion of medium prl with two polyclonal anti-hprl antisera inhibited the growth of jurkat cells in a dose-dependent as evaluated by cell number and 3h-tdr purified pituitary or recombinant hprl at a wide range of concentrations had no significant effect on their but reversed the blocking activity of the anti-hprl recombinant il-2 had no effect on the antibody-induced growth taken as a these results demonstrate that prl can act as an autocrine t cell growth factor independently of il-2 and are the first evidence of its involvement in human leukemic growth and possibly in leukemic
the importance of enzyme inhibition kinetics for the effect of thrombin inhibitors in a rat model of arterial the relation between the antithrombotic effect in and the inhibition constant (ki) and the association rate constant (k(on)) in vitro was investigated for eight different thrombin the carotid arteries of anaesthetized rats were exposed to fecl3 for 1 and the thrombus size was determined from the amount of incorporated the thrombin inhibitors were given and complete concentration- and/or dose-response curves were despite a difference between the ki-values comparable plasma concentrations of hirudin and melagatran were needed and micromol respectively) to obtain a 50% antithrombotic effect (ic50) in in there was a comparable in vitro (ki-value) and in vivo (ic50) potency ratio for melagatran and these results can be explained by the concentration of thrombin in the thrombus and improved inhibition by the low-molecular-weight for all eight thrombin inhibitors there was an inverse relationship between k(on)-values in vitro and the slope of the dose response curves in inhibitors with k(on)-values of < 1 x 10(7) m(-1) s(-1) gave steep dose response curves with a hill coefficient > the association time for inhibition of thrombin for slow-binding inhibitors will be too long to give effective antithrombotic effects at low plasma but at increasing concentrations the association time will resulting in a steeper dose-response curve and thereby a more narrow therapeutic
effects of short and long term ethanol on the activation of signal transducer and activator transcription factor 3 in normal and regenerating interleukin-6 (il-6) induced activation of signal transducer and activator transcription factor 3 (stat3) is a critical step in liver chronic ethanol consumption is known to increase the plasma concentration of yet the ability of the liver to regenerate and the regenerative induction of several il-6 initiated events are impaired in chronic alcoholic liver we hypothesized that chronic ethanol consumption inhibits il-6 dependent signal to test this the effect of ethanol on the stat3 signal transduction pathway was studied in the adult rat in vitro treatment of freshly isolated normal adult rat hepatocytes with 50-100 mm ethanol for 30 min blocked il-6-induced stat3 long-term ethanol intake in vivo significantly attenuated the activation of stat3 induced either in vivo by partial hepatectomy or in vitro by in short-term ethanol consumption enhanced the regenerative induction of stat3 but inhibited il-6 induced stat3 these data suggest that the inhibition of liver regeneration by chronic ethanol consumption at least in mediated by modulating the activation of
1 d3 increases transforming growth factor and transforming growth factor receptor type i and ii synthesis in human bone to determine whether the inhibition of human osteoblast growth mediated by 1 d3 (1 occurs as a result of changes in transforming growth factor (tgf) and tgf receptor we examined the effects of 1 on the synthesis of tgf beta and tgf-beta treatment with 1 but not increased tgf-beta 2 concentrations in human osteoblast cell supernantants in a dose- and time-dependent the increase in tgf-beta 2 concentrations was associated with an inhibition of osteoblast cell antibodies directed against transforming growth factor beta partially blocked the inhibition of cellular growth mediated by 1 tgf-beta 2 gene transcription and tgf-beta 2 mrna concentrations were increased in 1 but not in vehicle-treated 1 increased tgf-beta type i and type ii receptor mrna levels in increased expression of tgf-beta 2 and tgf-beta receptors by 1 might account for the inhibition of human osteoblast growth seen following 1
interactions of the human class ii major histocompatibility complex protein hla-dr4 with a peptide ligand demonstrated by affinity capillary the interactions of empty recombinant major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class ii molecules (dra1*0101/drb1*0401) with a known peptide ligand [the ha(307-319) fragment of influenza virus hemagglutinin] were studied by capillary using an alkaline buffer system with the addition of non-ionic or zwitterionic detergent and high sensitivity laser-induced fluorescence both slowly and rapidly equilibrating binding could be this was accomplished using a pre-equilibration approach as well as migration shift experiments where receptor molecules were added to the electrophoresis this system may be useful for the study of both peptide binding to mhc molecules and screening for inhibition or amplification of binding by other ligands as well as for the study of the interactions of t-cell receptors with mhc-peptide
influence of extracellular k+ concentration on the time-course of na+/k+-atpase inhibition by cardiac glycosides with fast and low binding the magnitude of the k+ antagonism of cardiac glycoside binding to na+/k+-atpase prepared from porcine was estimated from the enzyme activities determined in the presence of different concentrations of k+ and the latter showing a 30 fold greater dissociation rate than an increase of [k+] (3-20 mmol/l) prolonged the half-lives of na+/k+-atpase inhibition and caused a rightward shift of the cardiac dose-response curves by the same almost maximal (4 fold) at 14 mmol/l these data could be verified from the cardiac glycoside-elevated intravesicular na+ concentrations of rat brain these concentrations declined rapidly in brain vesicles treated with alpha-methyl-digitoxigenin-glucoside but not with ouabain after k+ was increased from to 14 the results suggest that the magnitude of the k+ antagonism under physiological conditions is only limited by the lifespan of the cardiac glycoside-binding e2p enzyme conformation reduced by
specific inhibition of stat3 signal transduction by the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (stat3) protein is activated by the interleukin 6 (il-6) family of epidermal growth and a protein named pias3 (protein inhibitor of activated stat) that binds to stat3 was isolated and the association of pias3 with stat3 in vivo was only observed in cells stimulated with ligands that cause the activation of pias3 blocked the dna-binding activity of stat3 and inhibited stat3-mediated gene although stat1 is also phosphorylated in response to pias3 did not interact with stat1 or affect its dna-binding or transcriptional the results indicate that pias3 is a specific inhibitor of
biochemical and pharmacological characterization of a novel elastase sodium 3-trifluoro-1-isopropyl-2-oxopropyl]aminocarbonyl]pyrrolidin -1-yl]carbonyl]-2-methylpropyl] aminocarbonyl] benzoylamino] is a synthetic water-soluble inhibitor of human neutrophil this compound demonstrated a competitive and slow-binding inhibition of human neutrophil elastase with a ki of in studies using synthetic fk706 inhibited human neutrophil elastase activity and porcine pancreatic elastase activity with respective ic50 values of 83 and 100 inhibited more (ic50 values > 340 microm) other serine proteinases such as human pancreatic human pancreatic trypsin and human leukocyte cathepsin fk706 also effectively inhibited the hydrolysis of bovine neck ligament elastin (2 mg/ml final concentration) by human neutrophil elastase (4 microg/ml final concentration) with an ic50 value of 230 fk706 protected animals against human neutrophil elastase (50 microg/animal)-induced lung hemorrhage with ed50 values of microg/animal by intratracheal administration and mg/kg by intravenous subcutaneous administration of fk706 significantly suppressed human neutrophil elastase (20 microg/paw)-induced paw edema in mice in a dose-dependent manner (47% inhibition at a dose of 100 these results suggest that fk706 would be a useful tool for investigating the role of human neutrophil elastase in inflammatory disorders associated with an excess of such as pulmonary adult respiratory distress septic cystic chronic bronchitis and rheumatoid
development of membrane properties in taste cells of fungiform functional evidence for early presence of amiloride-sensitive sodium behavioral and physiological studies have demonstrated a reduced sensitivity to several taste stimuli early in it has been suggested that this reduced sensitivity results from a late maturation of underlying transduction little is about maturation of membrane properties of taste cells early in we have obtained whole-cell recordings from single fungiform taste cells of rat pups to examine the development of the nacl transduction although taste buds undergo a considerable increase in size during membrane capacitance measurements revealed no change in membrane surface area of individual taste suggesting that the increase in size results from an increase in the total number of cells per whole-cell recordings showed that taste cells from very young pups [postnatal day 2 (pnd2)] already possessed voltage-activated na+ and k+ currents with no apparent differences in size or kinetics compared with amiloride-sensitive na+ important for na+ were found as early as the magnitude of responses to amiloride and the percentage of amiloride-sensitive cells remained the same throughout all age the similarity of amiloride inhibition constants suggested that the channel in neonates is the same channel that is expressed in adult taste our results indicate that taste cells at pnd2 already have acquired the transduction elements necessary for signaling nacl responses to the afferent we hypothesize that complete functionality of the salt taste transduction may not be reached until amiloride-sensitive na+ channels become selectively localized at the apical this would explain previous studies indicating that amiloride sensitivity cannot be detected before pnd12 in the intact apical clustering of channels along with the opening of the taste pore and an increase in the total number of taste cells per bud likely constitute additional important steps toward a fully functional sensory
dexamethasone suppression test identifies a subset of elderly depressed patients with reduced platelet serotonin transport and resistance to imipramine inhibition of dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (hpa) is more common in elderly patients with depression than in younger depressed and glucocorticoids are known to influence serotonergic elderly depressed patients are also reportedly more resistant to therapeutic effects of in the current we measured platelet serotonin transporter binding sites and transport function in young and elderly depressed patients and determined the relationship to hpa status as assessed with the dexamethasone suppression test the density and affinity of transporter molecules showed no differences between young and elderly depressed regardless of dst transporter function showed a substantial interaction of aging with elderly dst suppressors showed a deficit in [3h]serotonin uptake capabilities and resistance to imipramine inhibition of no such defects were seen in the young depressed regardless of dst nor in elderly depressed dst these results are consistent with the view that depression in the elderly exhibits basic biological differences from depression in earlier and that such distinctions may account in part for therapeutic ineffectiveness of antidepressants in specific associated with the presence or absence of appropriate hpa
the na+-translocating oxidoreductase from vibrio alginolyticus--redox states of the fad prosthetic group and mechanism of ag+ the fad prosthetic group of the na+-motive oxidoreductase (na+-nqr) from vibrio alginolyticus was investigated by ultraviolet-visible and fluorescence the reduction of na+-nqr by excess nadh in the presence of 6-13 microm o2 resulted in the formation of the blue flavosemiquinone if the concentration of dioxygen was further reduced to microm neither the reduction of na+-nqr by nadh nor its reoxidation with ubiquinone-1 (q-1) yielded a stable flavosemiquinone in equilibrium with reductant or but the fully reduced (fl(red)h2) or oxidized flavin (fl(ox)) during reoxidation of fl(red)h2 with the intermediate formation of an absorbance band around 800 nm was which was tentatively assigned as the fl(red)h(-)-nad+ charge-transfer complete reoxidation of fl(red)h2 in na+-nqr was achieved by a fivefold excess of q-1 over these results indicated that only a small fraction of fad was in the flavosemiquinone redox state during turnover to mediate the electron transfer between the hydride and the one-electron acceptor the titration of na+-nqr with a specific was followed by the fluorescence emission spectra of fad the addition of ag+ resulted in a marked increase of the flavin fluorescence (16% at 200 nm with half-maximal saturation at approximately 50 nm indicating dissociation of fad from the the increase in fluorescence intensity correlated with the loss of enzyme gel filtration of the ag+-treated na+-nqr confirmed that fad had been displaced from the
[mechanism mediating hypertension induced by chronic inhibition of nitric oxide although the inhibition of nitric oxide (no) synthesis is known to induce systemic the underlying mechanisms mediating this type of hypertension are incompletely in the present study we investigated the influence of sodium intake on the pressor effect of long-term administration of the no synthesis ng-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester 16 mg/dl in drinking fluid for 8 in conscious sprague-dawley urinary excretion rates of catecholamine during no synthesis inhibition were also long-term administration of l-name produced a sustained elevation in tail-cuff pressure without altering urine or sodium excretion l-name-induced hypertension was accompanied by a decreased urinary excretion of the stable no no2- and and was aggravated when rats drank saline in place of tap inhibition of no synthesis resulted in a rightward shift of the pressure natriuresis relationship and a significant decrease in the slope of this urinary excretion of epinephrine and but not that of in l-name-treated rats significantly increased within the first week of the study when compared with those observed in control a natriuretic index of the sympathetic nervous the ratio of dopamine to norepinephrine was significantly less in l-name-treated rats than in control after 8-week treatment with renal morphologic evaluation revealed significant narrowing and obliteration of the l-arginine (2 g/dl in drinking fluid) completely reversed the elevation of blood pressure as well as the decrease in urinary no2- and no3- excretion and the increased urinary excretion of catecholamines associated with l-name treatment after 3 weeks of concomitant these results suggest that the inhibition of chronic no synthesis produces sodium-sensitive hypertension and that changes in sympathetic nerve activity at least in contribute to the sodium sensitivity in this type of
peroxynitrite modulates tyrosine-dependent signal transduction pathway of human erythrocyte band the product of the reaction between nitric oxide and superoxide is able to nitrate protein if this modification occurs on phosphotyrosine kinase it can down-regulate cell we investigated the effects of peroxynitrite on band 3-mediated signal transduction of human peroxynitrite treatment induced two different at low concentrations (10-100 microm) it stimulated a metabolic leading to 1) a reversible inhibition of phosphotyrosine phosphatase 2) a rise of tyrosine phosphorylation in the 22k cytoplasmic domain of band 3) the release of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the and 4) the enhancement of lactate at high concentrations (200-1000 peroxynitrite induced 1) cross-linking of membrane 2) inhibition of band 3 tyrosine 3) nitration of tyrosines in the 22k cytoplasmic domain of band 4) binding of hemoglobin to the 5) irreversible inhibition of phosphotyrosine kinase 6) massive methemoglobin and 7) irreversible inhibition of lactate our results demonstrate that at concentrations that could conceivably be achieved in vivo (10-100 peroxynitrite behaves like other it stimulates band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation and increases glucose one plausible physiologic effect of peroxynitrite is the up-regulation of signaling through the reversible inhibition of phosphotyrosine phosphatase at high concentrations of the tyrosine phosphorylation ceases in parallel with the nitration of band 3 but at these concentrations phosphotyrosine kinase activity and glycolysis are also irreversibly at least in red blood the postulated down-regulation of signaling by peroxynitrite cannot merely be ascribed to the nitration of tyrosine kinase
pretreatment with antibody to eosinophil major basic protein prevents hyperresponsiveness by protecting neuronal m2 muscarinic receptors in antigen-challenged guinea in antigen-challenged guinea pigs there is recruitment of eosinophils into the lungs and to airway decreased function of inhibitory m2 muscarinic autoreceptors on parasympathetic nerves in the and airway a rabbit antibody to guinea pig eosinophil major basic protein was used to determine whether m2 muscarinic receptor and the subsequent are due to antagonism of the m2 receptor by eosinophil major basic guinea pigs were challenged with ovalbumin and and m2 receptor function tested 24 h later with the muscarinic agonist antigen-challenged guinea pigs were hyperresponsive to electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves compared with loss of m2 receptor function was demonstrated since the agonist pilocarpine inhibited vagally-induced bronchoconstriction in control but not challenged pretreatment with rabbit antibody to guinea pig eosinophil major basic protein prevented and protected m2 receptor function in the antigen-challenged animals without inhibiting eosinophil accumulation in the lungs or around the hyperresponsiveness is a result of inhibition of neuronal m2 muscarinic receptor function by eosinophil major basic protein in antigen-challenged guinea
development of a suicide gene as a novel approach to killing mycobacterium the increase in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and high mortality among those co-infected with hiv-1 necessitates new therapeutic approaches directed at mycobacterium we hypothesized that a dominant-negative mutation in the dna-dependent rna polymerase gene would inhibit transcription of all genes by blocking access of the wild-type enzyme to an evolutionarily invariant lysine was substituted with arginine by site-directed mutagenesis in the rpob the dominant-negative rpob gene product inhibited a transposon-derived kanamycin-resistance gene in both smegmatis and tuberculosis leading to growth inhibition of the mycobacteria on solid media containing the dominant-negative mutant rpob gene is a potential suicide gene especially for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis once a delivery strategy is also

inhibition of shear stress-induced platelet aggregation by a specific inhibitor of cgmp-inhibited in vitro and ex dihydro-2(1h)-quinolinone) selectively inhibits cgmp-inhibited phosphodiesterase (pde3) and is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation induced by various effect of cilostazol on shear stress-induced human platelet aggregation (sipa) was examined in vitro and ex cilostazol inhibited sipa dose-dependently in the ic50 value of cilostazol for inhibition of sipa was 15 +/- microm (m +/- which was very similar to that +/- microm) for inhibition of adp-induced platelet cilostazol potentiates the inhibition of sipa by pge1 and enhances its ability to increase camp a single oral adminstration of 100 mg cilostazol to healthy volunteers produced a significant inhibition of this study demonstrates that cilostazol is an effective inhibitor of which may be important for the prevention and the treatment of arterial occlusive
d-glucose but not insulin reduces n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fmet-leu-phe)-induced shape changes in suspended human the effects of glucose (5-25 mm) and insulin concentration (40-320 microu/ml) on the cell shape of neutrophil granulocytes from healthy humans were both non-activated and n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fmet-leu-phe)-activated neutrophils in suspension were used as a model for initial chemotactic activation of neutrophil but not the non-metabolizable analogue dose-dependently reduced the fmet-leu-phe-induced (10(-8)m) neutrophil either alone or in combination with 25 mm was without effect on the fmet-leu-phe-induced neutrophil the inhibitory effect of d-glucose was observed already after 1 min of exposure to d-glucose and d-glucose diminished the fraction of neutrophils with elongated locomotor shape by changing it into an irregular cell suggesting that at least part of the d-glucose effect could be associated with mechanisms determining the typical locomotor the present results suggest that d-glucose through its but without the involvement of reduces chemotactically induced elongation to a locomotor neutrophil and thus neutrophil and that this effect of glucose appears prior to this glucose-induced inhibition of the neutrophil chemotactic response may be involved in the neutrophil deficiency seen in diabetes
comparison of a radioallergosorbent (rast) inhibition method and a monoclonal enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) for aeroallergen mouse and rat urinary proteins are potent occupational allergens for exposed methods of measuring airborne allergens differ and reported levels of allergens vary considerably between to compare the values obtained using two different methods of allergen air samples were collected in rat rooms in sweden and the united kingdom at 2 l/min on to polytetrafluoroethylene (ptfe) filters and extracted in buffer containing v/v tween airborne rat urinary allergen (rua) was measured in all samples by both rast inhibition using a polyclonal human serum pool (uk) and a two monoclonal antibody sandwich elisa employing antibodies specific for rat n (alpha2u-globulin) the two methods gave values which were correlated (r2 log values = but differed by several orders of magnitude (median [range] ratio of rast inhibition/elisa = 316 there was a systematic as the absolute values the difference in the measurements the rat urine standards used were antigenically a large contrast in rua values obtained from the two assays was observed in this this may be primarily due to methodological but variations in antibody specificities or composition of allergenic epitopes in the air samples may the results demonstrate that standardization of methods and antibodies is necessary before interlaboratory comparisons can be
long chain analogs of physostigmine as potential drugs for new insights into the mechanism of action in the inhibition of heptylphysostigmine is in advanced clinical trial as a drug for 8-morpholinooctylphysostigmine and are currently undergoing pre-clinical the mechanism of action of these compounds in the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase has been all the examined compounds display non competitive-like kinetics of there are no reversible components in the observed the whole inhibitory effect is due to the time-dependent pseudo-irreversible carbamylation of the active yet the observed time course of the inhibition does not match a simple second order an influence of the quaternary structure of the enzyme on the more complex kinetics of carbamylation is reactivation experiments on the inhibited enzyme show long lasting inhibitory effects for these the higher duration of the anticholinesterase effect of the morpholino derivatives compared to heptylphysostigmine should provide the basis for their higher therapeutic

effects of chronic nicotine ingestion on pressor response to nomega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester and ex vivo concentration and relaxation response of aorta to effects of nitric oxide synthase inhibition on blood vessels were studied in nicotine-treated male sprague-dawley rats drank a nicotine solution with a concentration of 25 or 50 microg/ml for 15 the blood pressure and heart rate of chloralose-anaesthetized rats and isolated aortic strip contractions were nomeganitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name)-induced hypertension was significantly reduced after chronic nicotine the emax of contractions of isolated aortic strips to noradrenaline were dose-dependently enhanced by nicotine and the potentiation was abolished by the relaxation of aortic strips to acetylcholine was significantly decreased in nicotine-treated whereas but not reversed this neither nicotine nor l-name affected the heart the results show that chronic nicotine treatment reduced the pressor response of copyright 1997 the italian pharmacological
pharmacological effects of sb a selective inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein in angiogenesis and chronic inflammatory disease chronic inflammatory diseases often are accompanied by intense supporting the destructive proliferation of inflammatory a model of inflammatory angiogenesis is the murine air pouch which has a hyperangiogenic in this we explored the regulation of inflammatory angiogenesis using sb a specific inhibitor of human p38 mitogen-activated protein (map) with an ic50 value of 60 nm and 50- to 1000-fold selectivity other kinases in this compound reduced the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of tumor necrosis factor at an ed50 value of in the inflammatory angiogenesis over the course of granuloma we observed elevated levels of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha during the chronic inflammatory phase when intense angiogenesis sb 220025 at 30 mg/kg was able to greatly reduce the expression of these cytokines and inhibit angiogenesis by approximately to further study the effects of p38/csbp map kinase inhibition in angiogenesis-dependent chronic inflammatory sb 220025 was tested in murine collagen-induced in this sb 220025 was able to prevent the progression of established this p38/csbp map kinase which can reduce inflammatory cytokine production and inhibit is an effective treatment for chronic proliferative inflammatory
neurogenic vasodilatation and plasma leakage in the primary afferent nerve fibers control cutaneous blood flow and vascular permeability by releasing vasoactive these vascular reactions and the additional recruitment of leukocytes are commonly embodied in the term neurogenic calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp) acting via cgrp1 receptors is the principal transmitter of neurogenic dilatation of arterioles whereas substance p (sp) and neurokinin a (nka) acting via nk1 receptors mediate the increase in venular neurogenic vasodilatation and plasma protein leakage play a role in inflammation because many inflammatory and immune mediators including interleukin-1 nitric and 5-hydroxytryptamine can stimulate peptidergic afferent nerve fibers or enhance their neurogenic inflammatory reactions can be suppressed by alpha 2-adrenoceptor histamine acting via h1 5-hydroxytryptamine acting via 5-ht1b opioid and somatostatin through prejunctional inhibition of peptide release from vasoactive afferent nerve and nka receptor antagonists are powerful pharmacological tools to inhibit neurogenic inflammation at the postjunctional imbalance between the facilitatory and inhibitory influences on afferent nerve activity has a bearing on chronic inflammatory impaired nerve function represents a deficit in skin homeostasis while neuronal overactivity is a factor in allergic and hyperreactive disorders of the
preconditioning in rat hearts is independent of mitochondrial f1f0 atpase mitochondrial f1f0 adenosinetriphosphatase (atpase) is responsible for the majority of atp synthesis during normoxic but under ischemic conditions it accounts for significant atp a previous study showed that preconditioning in isolated rat hearts is mediated by inhibition of this atpase during we tested this hypothesis in our isolated rat heart model of preconditioning was accomplished by three 5-min periods of global ischemia separated by 5 min of this was followed by 20 min of global ischemia and 30 min of preconditioning significantly enhanced reperfusion contractile function and reduced lactate dehydrogenase release but paradoxically reduced the time to onset of contracture during global myocardial atp was depleted at a faster rate during the prolonged ischemia in preconditioned than in sham-treated which is consistent with the reduced time to atp during reperfusion was repleted more rapidly in preconditioned which is consistent with their enhanced contractile preconditioning significantly reduced lactate accumulation during the prolonged we were not able to demonstrate that mitochondrial f1f0 atpase (measured in submitochondrial particles) was inhibited by preconditioning before or during the prolonged the mitochondrial atpase inhibitor oligomycin significantly conserved atp during ischemia and increased the time to the onset of which is consistent with inhibition of the mitochondrial our results show that preconditioning in rat hearts can be independent of mitochondrial atpase inhibition as well as atp
progesterone blockade of a luteinizing hormone surge blocks luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone fos activation and activation of its preoptic area progesterone is capable of facilitating or blocking the luteinizing hormone (lh) depending on the timing of its the precise targets of actions are since recent studies described the presence of a periventricular preoptic area (pepoa) neuron population afferent to lh-releasing hormone (lhrh) neurons that is co-activated to express c-fos with lhrh neurons at the time of the lh the present study was designed to determine if the pepoa neurons contain progesterone receptors (prs) and whether progesterone inhibition is manifested by a failure of lhrh and pepoa neurons to become activated at the time of an lh for progesterone a group of immature rats each received a silastic capsule mm mm cm long) containing estradiol-17beta (e2) in peanut oil (150 microg/ml) at h on postnatal day 28 followed 24 h later by a progesterone implant mm mm cm for progesterone a second group of rats received the estrogen capsule and a progesterone capsule mm mm cm long) together at h on day and 24 h later received only a blank on the afternoon of postnatal day all animals were anesthetized and perfused for localization of c-fos and prs or c-fos and the present studies determined that following a progesterone-inhibition along with blockade of the lh both activation of lhrh and pepoa neurons was low or staining of prs in progesterone-facilitated and progesterone-inhibited rats indicated that the pepoa neurons contained prs in similar double labeling of c-fos and prs in progesterone-facilitated rats indicated that nearly all the c-fos-positive neurons of the pepoa (80 +/- co-expressed in progesterone-inhibited only 32 +/- 12% of few c-fos-positive neurons also contained in no instance were lhrh neurons found to contain taken these data suggest that both progesterone facilitation and inhibition likely involve direct actions of progesterone on the pepoa and are consistent with a role for the pepoa neurons in transducing steroid effects on lhrh
comparison of catalase in diploid and haploid rana rugosa using heat and chemical inactivation the present study examines differences in the hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) detoxifying found in the tails and livers of diploid and haploid rana investigative techniques include measurement of catalase activity and tests for temperature stability and chemical catalase from the tails of pre-climactic (stage xxiii) haploids was found to be over three times as h2o2 destructive as catalase from similar tails of catalase from the livers of newly metamorphosed (stage xxv) on the other displayed only one third the activity seen in diploid the catalase in haploid tail and liver proved to be more heat retaining 40-60% of its original activity after 5 min of treatment at 55 degrees whereas diploid catalase was totally inactivated under the same haploid and diploid catalase also responded differently to inhibition using urea and these differences suggest that haploid catalase has diverged from normal diploid catalase through molecular resulting in abnormal systems for h2o2 which in turn are thought to be responsible for organ dysfunction and early death seen in haploid
p-glycoprotein transporters and the gastrointestinal evaluation of the potential in vivo relevance of in vitro data employing talinolol as model among the different application routes peroral administration remains the one most widely mechanisms affecting bioavailability are of particular also in drug in recent intestinal drug secretion mediated by the multi-drug resistance gene product p-glycoprotein (pgp) has been discovered as a possible mechanism of low and erratic due to the saturability of this a dose-dependent apparent oral clearance may be observed which decreases upon increasing in vivo intestinal secretion might be revealed only in the lower or subtherapeutic dose in permeability studies with caco-2 cell the mdr-reversing agent verapamil inhibits secretion of p-glycoprotein substrates increases apical-to-basolateral the aim of the rat studies with talinolol presented here was to test the relevance of the intestinal secretion process as well as the extent of inhibition by verapamil in ex in and in vivo talinolol/verapamil drug-drug interaction intestinal secretion of talinolol was detected indirectly in ex vivo studies via transport inhibition with verapamil and directly in in situ intestinal perfusions in rats following a talinolol both and verapamil appear to affect the concentration-time profiles of relevant observations with respect to drug absorption are the decreased apparent oral clearance upon verapamil coadministration as well as the decreased tmax and mean absorption times at high verapamil talinolol may be regarded as a potential model compound for mechanistic studies on pgp including permeability as well as binding studies and the involvement of transporters other than
mechanotransduction and intracellular signaling mechanisms of stretch-induced remodeling in endothelial we investigated the signaling mechanism of stretch-induced cell remodeling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells freshly dissociated huvecs were cultured on an elastic silicon membrane and subjected to uniaxial cyclic stretch (20% in 1 the cells started to change their morphology as early as 15 min after stretch and most cells eventually aligned perpendicularly to the stretch axis within 1 this remodeling was dependent on the increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([ca2+]i) via a ca(2+)-permeable stretch-activated (sa) during the process of extensive rearrangement of stress fibers and focal adhesions was which may be close to the final step in the intracellular signaling this event was suggesting the existence of a ca(2+)-dependent intermediate cascade that links [ca2+]i to the rearrangement of cytoskeletons and focal we found that some including pp125fak (focal adhesion kinase) and were tyrosine phosphorylated during cyclic stretch in a ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of this tyrosine phosphorylation prohibited the stretch-dependent rearrangement of cytoskeletons and focal adhesions as well as the finally the tyrosine kinase which could phosphorylate was found to be activated in a [ca2+]i-dependent way during all of the above molecular events were consistently which led us to propose the signaling sa channel activation-->[ca2+]i increase-->src activation-->protein tyrosine phosphorylation-->rearrangement of cytoskeletons and focal adhesions-->cell
inhibition of pulmonary eosinophilia in p-selectin- and icam-1-deficient adhesion molecule expression by pulmonary endothelial cells is considered to play an important role in the recruitment of circulating leukocytes to sites of inflammation in the we have used p-selectin- and intercellular adhesion molecule type 1 (icam-1)-deficient mice to determine whether these adhesion molecules are important to pulmonary eosinophil recruitment after allergen there was a significant inhibition of lung tissue eosinophil recruitment in icam-1-deficient mice (approximately 84% inhibition compared to wild-type mice) and p-selectin-deficient mice (approximately 67% inhibition compared to wild-type mice) 3 h after allergen the number of bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) eosinophils in p-selectin-deficient and icam-1-deficient mice was also significantly reduced compared with wild-type levels of bal eosinophil peroxidase (epo) were significantly lower in icam-1-deficient mice +/- epo units) compared with wild-type mice +/- epo there was no significant difference in the degree of inhibition of eosinophil recruitment in icam-1-deficient mice at the three time points and 24 h) of study after allergen in p-selectin-deficient mice there was a decline in the degree of inhibition of eosinophil recruitment from 3 h (67% inhibition) and 12 h (72% inhibition) to 24 h postchallenge (38% suggesting that other adhesion molecules may be playing a more prominent role than p-selectin at later time these studies suggest an important role for icam-1 and p-selectin in eosinophil recruitment to the lung after allergen
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate the putative target of the antiapoptotic compounds cgp 3466 and r-(-)-deprenyl (selegiline) represents one of the drugs currently used for the treatment of this compound was shown to protect neurons or glias from programmed cell death in a variety of the mechanism of action of neuroprotection as well as inhibition of apoptosis remains cgp 3466 is a structurally related analog of r-(-)-deprenyl that exhibits virtually no monoamine oxidase type b inhibiting activity but is neuroprotective in the picomolar concentration we showed specific binding of cgp 3466 to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase by affinity by affinity and by means of biacore(r) apoptosis assays based on the human neuroblastoma cell line paju established the importance of this interaction for mediating drug-induced inhibition of programmed cell
impaired learning in rats in a 14-unit t-maze by a neuronal nitric oxide synthase is attenuated by the nitric oxide in previous it was demonstrated that systemic or central administration of the nitric oxide synthase (no synthase) ng-nitro-l-arginine produced dose-dependent learning impairments in rats in a 14-unit and that sodium a no could attenuate the since n-arg is not specific for neuronal no synthase and produces it is possible that effects on the cardiovasculature may have contributed to the impaired maze in the present we have investigated the maze performance of 3-4 months old male fischer-344 rats following treatment with a no synthase inhibitor that is selective for neuronal no synthase and does not produce in we examined the effects of the no which is much longer acting than sodium rats were pretrained to avoid footshock in a straight runway and received training in a 14-unit t-maze 24 h in an initial dose-response rats received intraperitoneal injections of either 7-nitroindazole or 65 mg/kg) or peanut oil 30 min prior to maze 7-nitroindazole produced dose-dependent maze acquisition with 65 mg/kg producing the greatest learning this dose of 7-nitroindazole had no significant effect on systolic blood following the dose-response rats were given injections of either 7-nitroindazole (70 mg/kg) plus 7-nitroindazole (70 mg/kg) plus the no molsidomine (2 or 4 or peanut oil plus saline as both doses of molsidomine significantly attenuated the learning deficit induced by 7-nitroindazole relative to these findings represent the first evidence that impaired learning produced by inhibition of neuronal no synthase can be overcome by systemic administration of a no
changes in force and cytosolic ca2+ concentration after length changes in isolated rat ventricular changes in cytosolic [ca2+] ([ca2+]i) were measured in isolated rat trabeculae that had been micro-injected with fura-2 in order to investigate the mechanism by which twitch force changes following an alteration of muscle a step increase in length of the muscle produced a rapid potentiation of twitch force but not of the ca2+ the rapid rise of force was unaffected by inhibiting the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) with ryanodine and cyclopiazonic the force-[ca2+]i relationship of the myofibrils in determined from twitches and tetanic contractions in sr-inhibited showed that the rapid rise of force was due primarily to an increase in myofibrillar ca2+ with a contribution from an increase in the maximum force production of the after stretch of the muscle there was a slow increase of twitch force which was due entirely to a slow increase of the ca2+ since there was no change in the myofibrillar force-[ca2+]i sr inhibition slowed but did not alter the magnitude the slow force during the slow rise of force there was no slow increase of diastolic whether or not the sr was the same was true in unstimulated we conclude that the rapid increase in twitch force after muscle stretch is due to the length-dependent properties of the the slow force increase is not explained by length dependence of the myofibrils or the or by a rise in diastolic evidence from tetani suggests the slow force responses result from increased ca2+ loading of the cell during the action
allergens in pepper and immunologic investigation of the celery-birch-mugwort-spice mugwort and birch pollen allergy are frequently associated with ige-mediated hypersensitivity to celery and we analyzed 22 sera from patients with the mugwort-birch-celery-spice syndrome for ige binding to the spices pepper and paprika by immunoblot results revealed two major allergens of 28 and 60 kda in pepper and a 23-kda allergen together with allergens of higher molecular weight in in immunoblot-inhibition crude birch and celery extracts significantly reduced the ige binding to pepper and paprika no inhibition was achieved with rbet v 1 and rbet v suggesting that no homologs of these birch proteins act as allergens in pepper or paprika n-terminal sequence analysis of the 14- and 28-kda pepper and 23-kda paprika allergens revealed no homology to known the 28-kda pepper allergen showed homology to a wheat germin and the 23-kda paprika allergen was identified as a homolog of a osmotin-like or pathogenesis-related protein in we conclude that the ige cross-reactivity in the mugwort-birch-celery-spice syndrome to the spices pepper and paprika is not caused by homologs of bet v 1 and n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the main allergens in pepper and paprika indicate a relation to frequently occurring plant
the overexpression of bax produces cell death upon induction of the mitochondrial permeability stably transfected jurkat t cells were produced in which bax expression is inducible by muristerone the cell death resulting from induction of the overexpression of bax was prevented by inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition (mpt) with cyclosporin a (cya) in combination with the phospholipase a2 inhibitor aristolochic acid the caspase-3 inhibitor z-asp-glu-val aspartic acid fluoromethylketone (z-devd-fmk) had no effect on the loss of the mpt was measured as the cya plus ara-preventable loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential the mpt was accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from the caspase-3 activation in the cleavage of the nuclear enzyme poly(adp-ribose)polymerase and dna all of which were inhibited by cya plus z-devd-fmk had no effect on the loss of deltapsim and the redistribution of cytochrome c but did prevent caspase-3 parp and dna it is concluded that bax induces the a critical event in the loss of cell in addition to the cell the mpt mediates other typical manifestations of apoptosis in this namely release of cytochrome caspase activation with parp and dna

the effect of atp-depletion on the inhibition of glucose exits from human red the effect of atp-depletion or its by metabolic on the inhibition of glucose transport by various inhibitors was studied in human red in cells depleted of glucose exit times were longer than in normal cells and the times increased with the duration of the km for external glucose was higher in atp-depleted cells than in normal undepleted cells mm mm at 30 degrees in the apparent ki for cytochalasin b decreased from microm in the normal cells to microm after half-maximal rates of glucose exit in the and in the presence of 2 microm cytochalasin b were found at atp concentrations of and although glucose exits from atp-depleted cells exposed to the irreversible inhibitor of glucose (fdnb) were slower than in normal the relative degrees of inhibition were not significantly normal and atp-depleted cells responded differently to treatment with a modifier of arginine residues which inhibits glucose while normal cells were markedly depleted cells were much less affected and the inhibitory effect of cytochalasin b seen in normal cells was these findings demonstrate that the glucose transport system of human red cells is affected by intracellular atp and that atp alters the affinity of the transporter for certain the implications of these findings are copyright 1998 elsevier science
participation of intraluteal progesterone and prostaglandin f2 alpha in lh-induced luteolysis in pregnant we examined the participation of the intraluteal levels of progesterone (p4) and prostaglandin f2 alpha (pgf2 alpha) in the induction of luteolysis by lh and its relationship with the induction of the 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity (20 subcutaneous administration of four doses of 10 microgram ovine lh (olh) at 1000 and 1100 h on day 19 of pregnancy induced a decrease in the activity of the enzyme 3 beta-hsd 24 and 48 h after treatment and an increase in luteal 20 alpha-hsd activity 48 h after olh treatment when compared with control intraluteal and serum p4 levels were lower than control values 24 and 48 h after olh with a significant increase in luteal pgf2 alpha content and a decrease in corpus luteum (cl) weight 48 h after olh intrabursal ovarian treatment with an inhibitor of biosynthesis (diclofenac) (70 microgram/ovary) or p4 (3 microgram/ovary) on day 20 of prevented the increase in 20 alpha-hsd activity observed 48 h after olh without any effect on 3 beta-hsd the administration of p4 prevented the increase in intraluteal pgf2 alpha content induced by olh treatment and the increases in 20 alpha-hsd activity and intraluteal pgf2 alpha content observed in control animals on day 21 of the inhibition of pg biosynthesis also prevents the decrease in intraluteal and serum p4 level induced by these results provide good evidence of the important participation of intraluteal p4 and pgf2 alpha on the olh-induced luteolysis in pregnant we also found the p4 produced by the cl is in in the regulation of luteal pg the early decline in 3 beta-hsd activity and the consequent fall in intraluteal p4 may trigger the synthesis of pgs and thereafter the increase in luteal 20 alpha-hsd activity to establish
ethanol inhibition of nmda currents in acutely dissociated medial septum/diagonal band neurons from ethanol dependent the effect of acutely applied ethanol and the impact of chronic ethanol sufficient to induce tolerance and physical on n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor function were studied in acutely isolated neurons from the medial septum/diagonal band (ms/db) of adult rats using whole patch-clamp there was a small positive correlation for capacitance and current amplitude activated by 100 microm nmda for all cell membrane capacitance was significantly smaller for ethanol dependent (approximately 80-84%) than either naive or control therefore nmda-activated responses were normalized for capacitance (current pa/pf) across all three nmda-activated (30-1000 microm) responses were significantly larger in cells from control and ethanol dependent rats relative to those from in estimated maximal responses were significantly larger for ethanol dependent compared to either control or while ec50s and slopes were not significantly acute 60 mm ethanol significantly inhibited responses to 100 microm nmda in all three mean ethanol inhibition was 12-25% smaller after ethanol there was no evidence of acute tolerance to ethanol inhibition for any but examination of patterns of inhibition for individual neurons showed a few cells were resistant to ethanol or exhibited progressive loss of ethanol these results suggest that nmda receptor function in acutely isolated ms/db neurons is increased following in vivo chronic ethanol and shows resistance to acute ethanol inhibition suggesting nmda receptor-mediated cellular
reactivities of the s2 and s3 subsite residues of thrombin with the native and heparin-induced conformers of a pentasaccharide (ps) fragment of heparin capable of activating antithrombin (at) markedly accelerates the inhibition of factor xa by but has insignificant effect on inhibition of for inhibition of the bridging function of a longer polysaccharide chain is required to accelerate the to study the basis for the similar reactivity of thrombin with the native or heparin-activated conformers of several residues surrounding the active site pocket of thrombin were targeted for mutagenesis leu99 and the variant residues influencing the s2 and s3 subsite specificity of thrombin were replaced with tyr and the and trp60d residues forming part of the s2 specificity pocket were deleted from the b-insertion loop of the wild-type and leu99/glu192 --> tyr/gln kinetic studies indicated that the reactivities of all mutants with at were moderately or severely although heparin largely corrected the defect in it also markedly elevated the stoichiometries of inhibition with the ps also accelerated at inhibition of the mutants suggesting that the mutants are able to discriminate between the native and activated conformers of based on these results and the recent crystal structure determination of at in complex with a model for thrombin-at interaction is proposed in which the s2 and s3 subsite residues of thrombin are critical for recognition of the p2 and p3 residues of at in the native in the activated other residues are made accessible for interaction with the and the similar reactivity of thrombin with the native and heparin-activated conformers of at may be the results further suggest that the s2 and s3 subsite residues are crucial in controlling the partitioning of the thrombin-at intermediate into the alternative inhibitory or substrate pathways of the
inhibition of hepatitis c virus adsorption to peripheral blood mononuclear cells by dextran human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) can be infected in vitro with sera of hepatitis c virus (hcv)-infected we have treated pools of pbmc with dextran sulfate mw before infection with various hcv(+) when the cells were treated with dextran sulfate 10-3 hcv rna was no longer detectable after infection with all hcv genotypes when the cells incubated with dextran sulfate 10-3 m and 10-4 m were maintained in culture for 4 no significant hcv replication could be our data suggest that dextran sulfate inhibits the attachment of hcv to the cell since the hcv rna detection was similar to control cells when dextran sulfate was added after
inhibition of methotrexate-induced chromosomal damage by folinic acid in v79 methotrexate an anticancer is widely used in the treatment of it induces cytogenetic damage as well as cytostatic effects on a variety of cell folinic acid (leucovorin) is generally administered along with mtx as a rescue agent to decrease mtx-induced information regarding the inhibitory effect of folinic acid against cytogenetic damage caused by mtx is this study was conducted to assess the cytogenetic effect of mtx and its inhibition by folinic acid (fa) using the micronucleus and chromosomal aberration assays exponentially growing v79 cells were treated with mtx at five different concentrations (5-100 micrograms ml-1) with s9 microsomal fraction for 6 h and post-treated with two concentrations of fa (5 or 50 micrograms) for 40 results indicate that mtx alone induced a concentration-related increase in % micronucleated binucleated cells (mnbn) and % aberrant cells there was a decrease in nuclear division index (ndi) with increase in mtx the mitotic index (mi) also decreased in all concentrations of mtx the addition of fa at 50 micrograms ml-1 significantly reduced % mnbn (40-68%) and % abs inhibition was also seen at 5 micrograms fa (12 to 54% for mnbn and 20 to 61% for these results indicate that fa is capable of reducing the cytogenetic damage induced by mtx and appears to be an anticlastogenic
suppression of phospholipase c blocks gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase the potential effect of inhibition of phospholipase c on the response of gi-coupled receptors was investigated in neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid (ng108-15) the phospholipase c specific inhibitor which did not affect basal and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase time- and dose-dependently blocked delta-opioid receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase the ec50 microm) of which was consistent with that for inhibition of bradykinin-dependent phospholipase c activation (ec50 = 1 u73122 treatment also blocked functional responses of m4 muscarinic receptor and alpha2-adrenoceptor in ng108-15 cells and three opioid receptors delta and opioid receptor-like receptor (orl1)) in human neuroblastoma sk-n-sh 5-pyrrolidinedione an inactive analog of did not show any which suggests that the blockade by u73122 of gi-coupled receptor-mediated signaling is probably mediated through inhibition of phospholipase although a possible direct modification of g proteins can not be treatment with u73122 but not u73343 blocked the gtp-induced inhibition of adenylyl indicating blockade at the level of gi
iaps block apoptotic events induced by caspase-8 and cytochrome c by direct inhibition of distinct inhibitor of apoptosis (iap) gene products play an evolutionarily conserved role in regulating programmed cell death in diverse species ranging from insects to human ciap1 and ciap2 are direct inhibitors of at least two members of the caspase family of cell death caspase-3 and here we compared the mechanism by which iaps interfere with activation of caspase-3 and other effector caspases in cytosolic extracts where caspase activation was initiated by a proximal protease activated by ligation of tnf-family or by cytochrome which is released from mitochondria into the cytosol during these studies demonstrate that ciap1 and ciap2 can prevent the proteolytic processing of pro-caspases -6 and -7 by blocking the cytochrome c-induced activation of in these iap family proteins did not prevent caspase-8-induced proteolytic activation of they subsequently inhibited active caspase-3 thus blocking downstream apoptotic events such as further activation of these findings demonstrate that iaps can suppress different apoptotic pathways by inhibiting distinct caspases and identify pro-caspase-9 as a new target for iap-mediated inhibition of
integrin and cadherin synergy regulates contact inhibition of migration and motile integrin receptors play a central role in cell migration through their roles as adhesive receptors for both other cells and extracellular matrix in this we demonstrate that integrin and cadherin receptors coordinately regulate contact-mediated inhibition of cell in addition to promoting proliferation and cell ectopic expression of the alpha5 integrin in cultures of primary quail myoblasts promotes a striking contact-mediated inhibition of cell myoblasts ectopically expressing alpha5 integrin (alpha5 myoblasts) move normally when not in but upon they show inhibition of migration and motile activity extension and retraction of membrane as a these cells tend to grow in aggregates and do not migrate to close a this phenotype is also seen with ectopic expression of beta1 or activated fak (cd2 fak) and therefore appears to result from enhanced integrin-mediated the contact inhibition observed in the alpha5 myoblasts is mediated by whose expression is upregulated more than perturbation studies using low calcium antibody and ectopic expression of wild-type and mutant n-cadherins all implicate n-cadherin in the contact inhibition of ectopic expression of n-cadherin also produces cells that show inhibited migration upon they do not show suppressed motile suggesting that integrins and cadherins coordinately regulate motile these observations have potential importance to normal and pathologic processes during embryonic development and tumor
cross-talk between protein kinase c-alpha (pkc-alpha) and -delta pkc-alpha elevates the pkc-delta protein altering its mrna transcription and studies utilizing the overexpression of individual isoforms indicated that both pkc-alpha and -delta promote a number of biological including inhibition of dna synthesis associated with rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton in the murine b-cell lymphoma differentiation of the murine promyelocyte line and activation of map kinase in cho we postulated that these results reflect some form of cross-regulation between pkc-alpha and -delta rather than their functional in this we show that overexpression of pkc-alpha in baf3 and 32d leads to an elevation of the endogenous pkc-delta mrna and protein the elevated steady-state pkc-delta mrna level results from a combination of increased pkc-delta transcription and mrna upregulation of pkc-delta mrna by pkc-alpha occurs even after a selective depletion of the pkc-delta in phorbol ester-induced elevation of pkc-delta mrna and protein levels can be prevented by the pkc inhibitor an indication of the requirement for pkc kinase inhibition of new protein synthesis by cycloheximide showed that upregulation of pkc-delta as opposed to delayed downregulation of the pkc-delta is primarily responsible for the accumulation of this isoform by in parental baf3 and 32d cells and pkc-alpha pkc-alpha and pkc-delta are uniquely involved in while and pkc-mu are
effects of pharmacological inhibition of glutamate-uptake on ischaemia-induced glutamate efflux and anoxic depolarization it has been proposed that deficient glutamate by increasing the extracellular concentration of this excitatory may contribute to the pathophysiology of cerebral this study aimed to examine whether pharmacological inhibition of glutamate uptake altered the kinetics of ischaemia-induced glutamate and precipitated anoxic microdialysis was used for application of the glutamate-uptake inhibitor recording of the eeg and extracellular direct current (dc) potential with an electrode within the and continuous monitoring of changes in extracellular l-trans-pdc was applied locally from 8 min prior to cardiac arrest to the end of the recording l-trans-pdc mm) barely altered the time course of postmortem glutamate efflux in the only the maximum rate of efflux during the first exocytotic and the concentration reached at the end of this appeared slightly l-trans-pdc (5 mm) reduced significantly the delay between eeg silence and anoxic depolarization in the cerebral cortex +/- s +/- n = but not in the striatum and these effects contrast with the marked increase in dialysate glutamate that l-trans-pdc produces in all these three brain these data do not support the hypothesis that inhibition of glutamate uptake plays a critical early in cerebral a contribution of reversed glutamate uptake to the secondary ca2+-independent phase of ischaemia-induced glutamate efflux cannot be ruled
effects of a nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor on renal sodium handling and diluting capacity in inhibition of nitric oxide (no) synthesis has antinatriuretic and antidiuretic limited information is available on the role of no in tubular sodium transport in the human we studied nine sodium-replete males with clearance techniques during maximal ng-monomethyl-l-arginine 3 mg/kg priming dose plus 3 mg/kg/h) was infused for 3 to achieve steady-state inhibition of no data were compared with a time control the effects of l-nmma were quickly established and persisted through the entire infusion mean arterial pressure increased slightly from 85+/-3 to 91+/-3 mmhg renal plasma flow decreased and glomerular filtration rate large decreases in absolute sodium from 79+/-10 to 34+/-5 micromol/min and fractional sodium from to were associated with significant reductions in fractional lithium excretion and maximum urine flow minimal urine sodium concentration decreased from to mmol/l whereas minimal urine osmolality increased plasma renin aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide levels did not whereas urinary excretions of guanosine monophosphate and of nitrite plus nitrate decreased inhibition of endogenous no synthesis in humans to an extent that raises blood pressure only mildly causes that can be attributed to increases in sodium reabsorption both at proximal and distal nephron in renal diluting capacity the effects in the diluting segment have not been reported and may be due to medullary similar to that described for angiotensin
the roles of the bacteriophage t4 r genes in lysis inhibition and fine-structure a new seldom has the study of a set of genes contributed more to our understanding of molecular genetics than has the characterization of the rapid-lysis genes of bacteriophage for t4 rii mutants were used to define gene structure and mutagen effects at the molecular level and to help unravel the genetic the large-plaque morphology of these mutants reflects a block in expressing lysis inhibition the ability to delay lysis for several hours in response to sensing external related phages attacking the which is a unique and highly adaptive attribute of the t4 family of surprisingly little is known about the mechanism of or how the various r genes affect its we review the extensive old literature about the r genes and the lysis process and try to sort out the major players affecting lysis we confirm that superinfection can induce lysis inhibition even while infected cells are suggesting that the signal response is virtually instantaneous and thus probably the result of post-translational we identify the ri gene as orf based on sequence analysis of canonical ri the ri gene encodes a peptide of 97 amino acids (mr = pi = that probably is secreted into the periplasmic this gene is widely conserved among t-even we then present a model for postulating that ri is largely responsible for regulating the gpt holin protein in response to the evidence suggests that the riia and b genes are not directly involved in lysis when they are an alternate pathway for lysis develops which depends on the presence of genes from any of several possible prophages and is not sensitive to lysis
synergistic action of quercetin and genistein in human ovarian carcinoma ovarian carcinoma is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in women and there has been a steady increase in the age-adjusted cancer death rates in the past 25 years in the patients who become cisplatin resistant respond poorly to available cytotoxic discovering novel targets for ovarian carcinoma is an anticancer arrests the cell cycle at g1 and s phase a plant attacks the cell cycle at g2 and/or early m phases in most carcinoma quercetin and genistein block the phosphatidylinositol conversion to ip3 signal transduction pathway mainly by inhibiting 1-phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (pi ec and 1-phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (pip ec because each drug attacks a different phase of the cell cycle and reduces ip3 concentration by attacking different signal transduction we tested the hypothesis that the two drugs might be synergistic in human carcinoma in human ovarian carcinoma ovcar-5 cells in growth inhibition the ic50s for quercetin and genistein were (mean +/- se) 66 +/- and 32 +/- in clonogenic assays they were 15 +/- and 5 +/- when quercetin was added to the cultures of ovcar-5 cells followed 8 h later by synergism was observed in growth inhibition and clonogenic the synergistic action of quercetin and genistein may be of interest in clinical treatment of human ovarian
independence of dimethylamiloride-sensitive li+ efflux pathways and na+-li+ countertransport in human the in vivo function of the erythrocyte na+-li+ countertransport (slc) is whether slc may reflect an operational mode of the widespread na+-h+ exchanger (nhe) or may otherwise be expression of an independent membrane remains presently we explored the presence of (dma)-sensitive li+ pathways in human erythrocytes where the activity of the na+ na+-k+ cotransport and anion exchange were suitably a total of mm dma had no effect on slc as but gave a significant inhibition of li+ efflux into both na+ and na+-free this dma-sensitive li+ but not was significantly enhanced by hyperosmolar cell which is a characteristic feature of in dma-sensitive li+ possibly mediated by are present in erythrocytes and coexist with the this finding supports the notion that slc is independent of amiloride-sensitive copyright 1998 elsevier science
morphine administered in the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis inhibits nociceptive activities in the spinal trigeminal nucleus the present study investigates the effects of morphine microinjection into the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (sp5c) or the spinal trigeminal nucleus oralis (sp5o) on c-fiber-evoked activities of sp5o convergent after supramaximal percutaneous electrical stimulation in halothane-anesthetized when it was microinjected into the morphine microg in 25 microl) never depressed the c-fiber-evoked responses of sp5o convergent neurons (n = whereas these neurons were responsive to the inhibitory effects of systemic morphine (6 in a naloxone-reversible on the morphine microinjected into the sp5c produced a naloxone-reversible inhibition of the c-fiber-evoked responses of sp5o neurons (n = the magnitude and the time course of this effect varied according to the location of the injection after microinjection into the superficial laminae (n = a strong depressive effect of morphine (7 +/- 5% of control) on the c-fiber-evoked responses was apparent as soon as 5 min after the injection and could always be reversed by administered either intravenously mg/kg) or locally microg in microl) at the same site as after microinjection into deeper laminae a significant depressive effect (34 +/- 5% of control) of morphine could be detected only 20 min after the injection and was reversed only by intravenous administration of these results suggest that morphine exerts its antinociceptive action on sp5o convergent neurons by blocking the c-fiber inputs that relay in the sp5c substantia the mechanisms that underlie the activation of sp5o convergent neurons by c-fibers and the inhibition of c-fiber-evoked responses of sp5o convergent neurons by morphine microinjected into the sp5c are
antiproliferative effects of inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibition on decidualization in pseudopregnant the aim of this study was to assess the involvement in decidual proliferation of nitric oxide a regulator of many cellular that is synthesized from l-arginine by no the investigation was conducted on pseudopregnant (pg) rats in which the decidual cell the basis for the decidualization was surgically induced by uterine trauma on pg day groups of animals (n = 5) were pretreated with either 2 doses/day of n(g)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name) that inhibits no or twice daily doses of l-name plus l-arginine drug application times coincided with 3 hr after lights on or 3 hr before lights the two treatment regimens (pg days 1-4 or 5-8) respectively preceded or followed decidual animals were sacrificed at mid-light on pg day the day of maximal growth response to the deciduogenic time-dependent increases in both no synthase activity and decidual growth occurred mainly in the l-name produced reductions in endometrial and myometrial growth that were reversed by the combined l-name plus l-arginine these inhibitory effects by l-name were caused by only the pretraumal (pg days 1-4) circulating progesterone levels were similarly affected by this early treatment and may also contribute to the reduced decidual in serum along with the zinc alkaline phosphatase and the matrix metalloproteinases--prominent decidualization biomarkers--were all unaffected by either the pre- or post-decidual induction the study demonstrates that inducible no synthase/endogenous no may physiologically participate in uterine metabolism during the decidual cell by virtue of l-name inhibition of the decidual it appears that no synthase/no may influence decidual growth either by directly increasing uterine sensitivity to the deciduogenic stimulus or by indirectly affecting endometrial vascularity and subsequent availability of decidual
modulation of icam-1 expression by alpha-msh in human melanoma cells and a proopiomelanocortin (pomc)-derived is known to be produced in the the and melanoma tumors and to possess many biological mainly on melanocyte pigmentation and the melanocyte expresses adhesion including the latter has been reported to play a role in melanoma spread and associated metastatic we conducted a study in order to evaluate the possible effect of msh on icam-1 expression in human cultured malignant and normal our data show that alpha-msh inhibits icam-1 expression stimulated by tnf in a concentration-dependent both at the protein and gene expression ninety percent inhibition was obtained with 10 nm while 50% inhibition was achieved with 1 endogenous camp elevation with forskolin as well as an exogenous camp stable analogue (sp-camps) produced the same inhibitory a screening of malignant melanocytes showed that inhibition of icam-1 expression could be achieved only in those cells expressing detectable msh receptors and seemed to correlate with the number of binding in our data strongly suggest alpha-msh as a potent inhibitor of icam-1 expression in malignant melanocytes acting through msh receptor stimulation and subsequent camp

metabolism of the anticancer drug a new inhibitor of cyclin dependent in rat flavopiridol (flap) is a promising novel chemotherapeutic agent currently undergoing clinical phase i to examine hepatic metabolism and biliary disposition of flap we applied the isolated perfused rat liver besides flap two metabolites were detected by high performance liquid chromatography in bile and twenty-five min after flap (30 microm) addition to the perfusion biliary secretion of metabolite 1 and 2 reached a maximum of +/- and +/- biliary excretion of parent continuously increased for 60 min up to 406 +/- 134 pmol/g in the metabolite 1 was below detection limit and release of metabolite 2 was low +/- pmol/g after 60 enzymatic hydrolysis with mass spectroscopy and electron absorption spectroscopy revealed that both metabolites are monoglucuronides with the glucuronide in position 5 and 7 of the flavonoid the amount of metabolite 1 and metabolite 2 excreted into bile during the 60 min of perfusion was +/- +/- and +/- of flap cleared from the perfusate during 60 in contrast to the structurally similar flavonoids genistein and no inhibition of udp-glucuronyltransferase with methylumbelliferone as a substrate was observed indicating that different udp-glucuronyltransferase isoforms are involved in flap in we find that glucuronidation is the major mechanism of hepatic flap metabolites are mainly excreted into bile but also released into systemic the pharmacological and toxicological effects of these metabolites remain to be
control of pulsatile lh secretion during seasonal anoestrus in the the seasonality of reproductive activity in the ewe in temperate latitudes is controlled by its annual variations control the temporal organization of the sexual cycle by changing the activity of the gonadotrophic cyclic oestrous behaviour usually appears in the ewe at the end of summer or the beginning of autumn and finishes in winter or at the very beginning of seasonal anoestrus is characterized by the absence of ovulation and sexual during seasonal a decrease in lh pulse frequency is the inhibition of pulsatile lh secretion is maintained throughout the anoestrous season and is responsible for the low reproductive activity during this variation in the seasonal inhibition of lh pulsatility results from an increase in the negative feedback by oestradiol on lh pulse frequency during the long days of spring and the inhibition of lh secretion involves increased action of dopamine in the hypothalamus on the chain of nervous elements which controls gonadotrophic among the various dopaminergic the retrochiasmatic a15 nucleus is involved in the inhibitory control of lh pulsatility by oestradiol during the long day oestradiol increases the dopaminergic tone of the a15 nucleus in ovariectomized ewes during the long day in this the effect of oestradiol on the dopaminergic metabolism probably results from a local in the dopamine might also participate in the inhibition of gonadotrophin activity during other periods of reproductive
a role for the signal transduction protein pii in the control of nitrate/nitrite uptake in a in the cyanobacterium synechococcus strain pcc ammonium exerts a rapid and reversible inhibition of the nitrate and nitrite and the pii protein (glnb) is differentially phosphorylated depending on the intracellular n/c rna/dna as well as nitrate and nitrite uptake were carried out with the wild-type strain and a pii-null the transcriptional control by ammonium of the expression of the nir-nrt abcd-narb operon remained operative in the mutant in contrast to the wild-type the mutant took up nitrate and nitrite even in the presence of the wild-type phenotype was restored by insertion of a copy of the wild-type glnb gene in the genome of the pii-null these results indicate that the unphosphorylated form of pii is involved in the short-term inhibition by ammonium of the nitrate and nitrite uptake in synechococcus strain pcc
docosahexaenoic a constituent of fetal and neonatal inhibits nitric oxide production by murine macrophages stimulated by ifn gamma plus or by ifn gamma plus listeria murine macrophage activation is deficient in the fetus and the and in areas of the placenta perfused by the fetal fetal and neonatal serum concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (dha) are 150 or approximately 50-fold higher than in the we previously showed that dha inhibits activation of the gene for inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) in murine macrophages stimulated in vitro with interferon gamma (ifn gamma) plus lipopolysaccharide we have now pursued these observations in greater an assay system was developed which separated the stimulation of macrophages by ifn gamma plus and the actual production of nitric oxide it was found that macrophages do not produce no until they have been stimulated by ifn gamma plus lps for a period of 10 no is produced during the subsequent 10 even though ifn gamma plus lps are not longer if inhibited only during the initial 10 h dha did not inhibit the production of no by macrophages which had previously been stimulated by ifn gamma plus and were already producing it was also found that dha was less inhibitory if given prior to the ifn gamma plus lps in a dose-responsive dha inhibited the increased abundance of inos mrna by macrophages stimulated by ifn gamma plus no contributes to the host defense against listeria monocytogenes and other intracellular we therefore investigated the ability of dha to inhibit no production by macrophages stimulated by ifn gamma plus listeria monocytogenes in dha inhibited transcription of the inos gene and also the listeriocidal activity of activated inhibition of no production by dha may contribute to the increased susceptibility of the fetoplacental unit and neonate to intracellular
inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis aggravates hepatic oxidative stress and enhances superoxide dismutase inactivation in rats subjected to tourniquet the role of nitric oxide (no) on liver oxidative stress and tissue injury in rats subjected to tourniquet shock was this shock model differs from others in that injury is a consequence of remote organ liver oxidative stress becomes evident after hind limb as evidenced by the loss of total tissue by increases in tissue oxidized glutathione lipid peroxidation plasma aminotransferases (alanine aminotransferase (alt) and (aspartate aminotransferase and plasma and by a 36% loss in total superoxide dismutase (sod) portal blood flow is reduced by after 2 h of hind limb inhibition of no synthesis with nomega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester or l-arginine methyl ester increased mean arterial blood further reduced portal blood and aggravated liver injury as assessed by further loss in total increased lpo and gssg and further increases in plasma alt and total plasma nitrites were lower than in control and total tissue sod activity decreased by more than treatment with the no donor sodium nitroprusside reverted the decrease in portal blood flow and also reverted tissue thiol and gssg as well as the loss of alt and ast to plasma and of sod activity to levels comparable to untreated control shock as plasma nitrites were greater than in tourniquet control these data support the hypothesis that endogenous no formation protects the rat liver from the consequences of oxidative stress elicited by hind limb reperfusion in rats subjected to tourniquet
functional implications of nitric oxide produced by mitochondria in mitochondrial the effects of endogenous production of catalysed by the mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase on mitochondrial metabolism were the respiratory rates of intact mitochondria in state 4 were decreased by 40% and 28% with succinate and in the presence of l-arginine the o2 uptake with ng-methyl-l-arginine a competitive inhibitor of was the production of and the inhibition of the respiratory rates were dependent on the metabolic state in which mitochondria were production was probably supported by mitochondrial the latter maintained by the energy-dependent in addition to the decline in the respiratory an inhibition of atp synthesis was also observed (40-50%) following supplementation with the dependence of the respiratory rates of mitochondria in state 3 and cytochrome oxidase activities on o2 concentrations with either l-arg or nmma indicated that both processes were competitively inhibited by at the cytochrome oxidase this inhibition can be explained by the interaction of with cytochrome oxidase at the binuclear the role of as a physiological modulator of cytochrome oxidase is discussed in terms of cellular
differential inhibition of n and p/q ca2+ currents by 5-ht1a and 5-ht1d receptors in spinal neurons of xenopus in whole-cell patch clamp recordings made from non-sensory neurons acutely isolated from the spinal cord of xenopus (stage 40-42) two forms of inhibition of the high voltage-activated (hva) ca2+ currents were produced by one was voltage dependent and associated with both slowing of the activation kinetics and shifting of the voltage dependence of the hva this inhibition was relieved by strong depolarizing a second form of inhibition was neither associated with slowing of the activation kinetics nor relieved by depolarizing prepulses and was thus voltage in all neurons 5-ht (1 microm) reversibly reduced 34 +/- % (n = 102) of the hva ca2+ in about 40 % of the inhibition was totally voltage in another 5 the inhibition was totally voltage in the remaining inhibition was only partially (by around 40 %) relieved by a large depolarizing suggesting that in the inhibition consisted of both voltage-dependent and -independent by using selective channel we found that 5-ht acted on both n- and p/q-type whereas the inhibition of p/q-type currents was only voltage the inhibition of n-type currents had both voltage-dependent and -independent the effects of 5-ht on hva ca2+ currents were mediated by 5-ht1a and 5-ht1d the 5-ht1a receptors not only preferentially caused voltage-independent but did so by acting mainly on the omega-agatoxin-iva-sensitive ca2+ in the 5-ht1d receptor produced both voltage-dependent and -independent inhibition and was preferentially coupled to omega-conotoxin-gvia sensitive this complexity of modulation may allow fine tuning of transmitter release and calcium signalling in the spinal circuitry of xenopus
influence of aluminum on the regulation of pth- and pathways in the rat osteosarcoma cell line ros the role of hormonal status in the development of aluminum (al)-dependent renal which is characterized by reduced bone matrix still remains largely to address this we used the osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cell line ros to evaluate the role of al on parathyroid hormone (pth)- and d3 activities in these al (1 microm) caused an inhibition of basal and alkaline but only at low doses (< 1 nm) of the al partly inhibited basal osteocalcin (oc) secretion in ros cells (p < and the dose-dependent increase in oc release by these cells was also reduced by 1 microm al at low concentrations of the steroid (< or = 1 whereas high doses of (> or = 5 nm) totally prevented the inhibiting effects of al also had strong inhibitory actions on pth-dependent camp production by ros cells over the concentration range tested this inhibitory action of al was also observed for pth-related peptide- 50 nm) but not for isoproterenol-dependent (100 nm) camp to evaluate more fully the mechanism of this inhibition of camp we investigated the effect of al on g protein-dependent regulation of camp formation and on the activation of adenylate cyclase by cholera toxin 10 applied to cells for 4 h prior to pth enhanced camp production about 2-fold above pth alone (p < a process that was further stimulated by pertussis toxin 1 4 h) did not modify basal pth-dependent camp formation by ros pt treatment prevented the inhibitory effect of al on camp formation by these cells (p < the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by forskolin and 1 which bypasses g protein was not modified by indicating that al does not affect adenylate cyclase northern blot analysis of pth receptor mrna levels showed that al did not modify pth receptor message in ros western blot analyses of g protein subunits showed that al did not significantly alter gs alpha subunit in accordance with the results obtained for camp-dependent formation in response to in gi alpha-1 and gi alpha-2 subunits were decreased by al consistent with pt-restricted increases in camp formation in al-treated ros taken these results suggest that al has multiple actions in osteoblast-like ros the effects of al are modulated by hormonal control of the pathways al affects functions only when this steroid is al has large inhibitory effects on pth- and pthrp-dependent camp this last feature is related to the ability of al to alter the g protein transducing pathway for pth/pthrp-dependent formation of camp since it does not affect adenylate cyclase activity directly and does not affect the pth receptor message al has stronger deleterious effects in osteoblast-like cells with an already compromised status and can modulate specifically pth/pthrp-mediated camp formation at the postreceptor
a c-myc antisense oligonucleotide inhibits human retinal pigment epithelial cell the purpose of this work was to investigate if myc-dependent intracellular mitogenic pathway is active in cultures of human retinal pigment epithelial (hrpe) cells and whether myc antisense phosphorotioate oligonucleotides (c-myc-as-odn) are useful tools for inhibiting the proliferation of hrpe cultures of hrpe cells were established from adult human corneal these cells were positively stained for cytokeratins and myc mrna expression was determined by northern blot analysis and it was determined by means of immunofluorescence if myc was c-myc-as-odn effect on cell proliferation was estimated by evaluating the incorporation of into cellular cell number was estimated by using a tetrazolium bromide based colorimetric human rpe cells in culture expressed myc and myc mrna as well as prothymosin alpha mrna--a gene whose transcription is under myc control--indicating that myc-dependent intracellular mitogenic pathway is active in these in accordance with we found that blocking the expression of myc by the addition of c-myc-as-odn to the culture medium inhibited hrpe cell the effect of the c-myc-as-odn was found to be sequence specific (the use of a control oligonucleotide with the same sequence but in an opposite direction had no effect) and dose-dependent (4 microm was the lowest effective dose by using rt-pcr we found that the c-myc-as-odn inhibition of cell proliferation was related to a diminution in c-myc mrna and by immunofluorescence we detected a diminution in c-myc protein staining in rpe cells after 48 hr of treatment with growth inhibition remained for at least 5 days after addition of a single dose of the c-myc-as-odn to the we conclude that hrpe cell proliferation is under myc blocking the expression of myc by c-myc-as-odn inhibited hrpe cell these findings establish a rationale for investigating the potential use of a c-myc-as-odn as a novel therapeutical tool in the treatment of proliferative
and infant negativity as antecedents of externalizing problems and inhibition at age 3 differential susceptibility to rearing to examine the effects of infant negative emotionality and of mothering and fathering during the toddler years on 3-year-old externalizing problems and as well as explore the proposition that children vary in their susceptibility to rearing 125 caucasian boys from maritally intact families were results revealed that when infant negativity is measured with and discriminantly valid no relation obtains between it and externalizing problems (nor as hypothesized on the basis of prior parenting was a stronger predictor of externalizing problems and inhibition in the case of children who were highly negative as mothering proved a stronger predictor of externalizing problems and fathering of with more negative mothering in the 2nd and 3rd year forecasting higher cbcl-externalizing scores and less negative fathering in the 2nd and 3rd year and more positive fathering in the 2nd year forecasting more inhibition at age 3 implications of these findings for studies of parental influence are
effects of yja20379-4 on gastric helicobacter pylori growth and various gastric and duodenal lesions in effects of a newly synthesized antiulcer on gastric proton pump (h+/k+-atpase) helicobacter pylori pylori) gastric acid and gastro-duodenal were examined in comparison with those of yja20379-4 markedly inhibited the h+/k+-atpase activity in a concentration-dependent manner and the inhibitory effect was increased under a weak acidic the ic50 values were 32 and 81 microm at ph and the inhibition was completely antagonized by mm dithiothreitol in yja20379-4 showed a significant pylori activity determined by the agar dilution the value of minimum inhibitory concentration microg/ml) was at least 3 times more potent than that of in pylorus ligated yja20379-4 inhibited basal gastric acid secretion when administered by the intraduodenal route in experimental ulcer yja20379-4 administered by the oral route dose-dependently prevented the development of gastro-duodenal lesions in repeated administration of yja20379-4 promoted the healing of gastric ulcers induced by acetic on the basis of the data it is suggested that yja20379-4 has a wide spectrum of antiulcer and its mode of antiulcer actions is dependent on the inhibition of h+/k+-atpase activity and pylori growth and the enhancement of a mucosal yja20379-4 might prove to be a beneficial therapy for gastritis and peptic ulcer
tumorigenicity of sodium ascorbate in male sodium like other sodium salts such as and produces urinary alterations when fed at high doses to which results in mild superficial urothelial cytotoxicity and regeneration but not tumors in a standard 2-year sodium saccharin was shown to produce a low incidence of bladder tumors in rats if administered in a two-generation in the present we evaluated sodium ascorbate in a two-generation bioassay that involved feeding to the male and female parental f344 rats for 4 weeks before feeding the dams during gestation and and then feeding the weaned (at 28 days of age) male f1 generation rats for the remainder of their lifetime (up to 128 weeks of the dietary levels of and sodium ascorbate were at and sodium there was an increase in urinary bladder urothelial papillary and nodular hyperplasia and the induction of a few papillomas and there was a dose-responsive increase in renal pelvic calcification and hyperplasia and inhibition of the aging nephropathy of rats even at the level of 1% sodium because the short-term urothelial effects of sodium ascorbate in rats are inhibited by treatments producing urinary acidification to ph < we coadministered high doses of long-term nh4cl to groups of rats with or sodium ascorbate to evaluate the long-term the combination of sodium ascorbate plus nh4cl in the diet was and the group was terminated early during the course of the the group fed sodium ascorbate plus nh4cl showed complete inhibition of the urothelial effects of sodium ascorbate and significant inhibition of its renal we also demonstrated the presence of a calcium phosphate-containing urinary precipitate in rats fed sodium ascorbate at all in a dose-responsive the formation of the precipitate was inhibited by coadministration with the proliferative effects of sodium ascorbate on the male rat urinary tract in this study are similar to those seen with sodium saccharin when administered in a two-generation mechanistic information suggests that this is a rat-specific
inhibition of an established allergic response to ovalbumin in balb/c mice by killed mycobacterium allergic disorders are mediated by t lymphocytes secreting t helper 2 (th2) interleukin-4 (il-4) and interleukin-5 resulting in high levels of serum immunoglobulin e (ige) and recruitment of one of the treatment strategies is to downregulate the th2 component by inducing a t helper 1 (th1) response to the relevant because th1 and th2 cytokines are thought to be mutually in this we examined the effects of mycobacterium a potent inducer of th1 on allergic responses in a murine a single injection of vaccae into ovalbumin (ova)-preimmunized balb/c mice suppressed serum ige over a wide dose range 10(8) or 10(9) further using 10(7) vaccae injected showed that this treatment inhibited not only serum but also the potential for ovalbumin-induced il-5 production by spleen this non-specific ability of a mycobacterium to decrease th2 even when not presented together with the is in agreement with recent epidemiological studies on the impact of bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg) and of other potent th1 on the incidence of the suppression of serum ige and allergen-specific il-5 synthesis by vaccae suggest that this organism is likely to have clinical application in the immunotherapy of
chimeric scfv/gamma receptor-mediated t-cell lysis of tumor cells is coregulated by adhesion and accessory adhesion and accessory molecules play a critical role in t-cell activation and effector function in general and in tumor cell recognition and lysis in we investigated the contribution of cd54 and cd58 molecules in t lymphocyte-tumor cell interactions mediated by chimeric immunoglobulin the chimeric receptor is composed of a single chain antibody binding site and a gamma-chain signal transducing molecule t lymphocytes expressing such scfv/gamma receptors recognize the g250 ag on renal cell carcinoma (rcc) in an major histocompatibility complex (mhc)-unrestricted manner and exert rcc selective a coregulatory role for cd3 and cd11a/cd18 molecules in scfv/gamma-mediated cytolysis was demonstrated using monoclonal antibody (mab)-induced inhibition of scfv/gamma-mediated the inhibition of lysis was not due to inhibition of cytotoxic t lymphocyte (ctl)-target cell conjugation but rather to a post-conjugate signaling binding of cd54 and cd58 mabs to the rcc did not inhibit cytolysis of rcc cells that expressed high levels of both cd54 and the g250 antigen (ag) whereas cytolysis of rcc expressing intermediate levels of cd54 and g250 ag (sk-rc-17 was partly inhibited by the cd54 binding of low concentrations of g250 mab to rcc (a75) rendered these cells sensitive to cd54 mab demonstrating a direct functional relation between g250 ag expression level and adhesion taken our findings indicate a coregulatory role for cd3 and cd11a/cd18 molecules in the scfv/gamma-mediated cytolysis of tumor cells and show that the requirement of cd11a/cd18-cd54 interactions is dependent on the level of free this make these gene-transduced t lymphocytes attractive tools for adoptive immunogene therapy of
small molecule inhibitor of hiv-1 cell fusion blocks chemokine receptor-mediated the intersection of the hiv and the chemokine fields began with the observation that hiv entry into cells could be blocked by certain subsequent work showed that hiv entry is dependent on the presence of specific chemokine these observations led us to evaluate a series of ureido analogs of distamycin previously reported to block hiv entry into cells in for chemokine antagonist one of the distamycin napthalenedisulfonic acid] hexasodium salt (nsc is shown here to inhibit syncytia formation and cell mechanistic studies showed that this inhibition was not due to conformational changes in gp120-gp41 induced by target cell cd4 and chemokine co-receptor and was therefore not due to interference with binding of additional mechanistic studies demonstrated that nsc 651016 inhibited chemokine binding to specific chemokine induced cxcr4 and ccr5 receptor and inhibited chemokine-induced chemotaxis by macrophage inflammatory protein and stromal-derived factor-1alpha but not monocyte chemotactic we describe a novel compound that inhibits in vivo replication of hiv-1 by down-regulation of these data lead us to propose that nsc 651016 may have in vivo anti-inflammatory
dibucaine displaceable sarcolemmal ca2+ fraction in guinea-pig cardiac in previous work we found that ca2+ bound to the internal leaflet of sarcolemma of the neonatal cultured rat cardiomyocytes may be displaced by a local dibucaine this resulted in inhibition of na/ca now we found that the dbc displaceable ca2+ fraction may be demonstrated also in enzymatically isolated cardiomyocytes of adult guinea only cell length was used as an index of the free sarcoplasmic ca2+ concentration since we found that dbc is fluorescent when irradiated with uv the wave length overlapping that of indo 1 dbc mm) induced a contracture whose amplitude ranged from 30%-100% of that of the electrically stimulated blocking of na/ca exchange with mm or 0ca2+ solution did not affect the amplitude nor the time course of the caffeine (15 mm) superfused during exposure of the cell to dbc initiated contraction which relaxed despite continued caffeine dbc also initiated contracture in cells pretreated with a blocker of sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+ dbc did not initiate contracture in skinned myocytes and decreased their sensitivity to these results suggest that dbc displaces ca2+ from sarcolemma and that the displacement results in inhibition of na/ca inhibition may be overcome by high subsarcolemmal ca2+ concentration induced by its sr release with dbc rapidly blocked sodium and calcium currents in voltage clamped calcium current recovered within about a minute upon washout of whereas recovery of sodium current started after about 8 min and was completed within about 12 rapid depolarisation from a holding potential of -80 mv to 0 or +20 mv potentiated the response of the cell to this suggests that the ca2+ fraction which is displaced by dbc is distinct from that released by depolarisation and therefore does not contribute to activation of a electrically stimulated
adaptation of the human pancreas to inhibition of luminal proteolytic background & feedback regulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion is well established in and their pancreases are able to adapt to intraduodenal inhibition of pancreatic enzymes by proteinase inhibitors such as camostate schwarz in this we addressed whether similar adaptive changes occur in the human pancreas after 4 weeks of 2 g/day camostate at the end and 2 weeks after 4-week camostate treatment (four times 500 mg pancreatic changes were analyzed with the use of a secretin-cerulein a test-meal cholecystokinin plasma and standardized ultrasonographic investigations of the duodenal trypsin output after secretion stimulation was significantly increased p < and duodenal bicarbonate output decreased 22% (p < after 4 weeks of camostate the size of the pancreatic head (vertical) increased 8% (p < at week 4 and decreased to pretreatment values 2 weeks after treatment (week the other three diameters measured (head and tail) showed a similar stimulated cholecystokinin plasma levels 15 minutes after application of a standard test meal increased 62% (p < the human pancreas adapts to oral application of the proteinase inhibitor these findings support the theory that feedback control of the exocrine pancreas operates in
genetically engineered single-chain fvs of human immunoglobulin against hepatitis c virus nucleocapsid protein derived from universal phage display specific single-chain fvs (scfvs) of human immunoglobulin that specifically recognized the recombinant hepatitis c virus (hcv) nucleocapsid protein were isolated from a large phage display antibody this universal library of genetically engineered filamentous phagemids displayed random pairings of the variable regions of both human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin in the scfv specific clones were isolated by affinity selection with purified recombinant hcv protein fused to glutathione-s-transferase the gst-specific clones were excluded by blocking the phagemid library with gst prior to the after 4 rounds of the hcv-reactive clones were enriched by a factor of about 4% and 9% of the clones from rounds 4 and specifically reacted to the hcv portion of the fusion protein in an enzyme the specificity was confirmed by specific binding inhibition with plasma from an hcv-infected nucleotide sequence analysis of 3 hcv-specific clones indicated that all 3 clones contained an almost identical vh gene sequence which was derived from the vh3 germline gene these clones had different vl gene sequences of the lambda there were some differences between nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the hcv-specific scfv genes and those of the closest matched germline indicating the presence of somatic this study illustrated the feasibility of using antibody engineering technology with the universal phage display library to isolate human antibodies with predefined specificity to important microbial pathogen which may be useful for future therapeutic
growth inhibition and cytotoxicity induced by bowman-birk inhibitor concentrate in cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer bowman-birk inhibitor (bbi) is a soybean-derived anticarcinogenic protease inhibitor that was shown to potentiate the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in our previous to assess the potential of bbi as a sensitizing agent for the chemotherapy of cisplatin-resistant we evaluated the effects of a soybean concentrate enriched in bbi (known as bbi concentrate or bbic) on cell growth and clonogenic survival of a human ovarian cancer cell and its cisplatin-resistant and the presence of bbi and bbic in the cell medium reduced the clonogenic survival of the and c200 cells in a dose-dependent manner and enhanced cisplatin-induced growth inhibition and/or bbic alone showed greater inhibitory effects on growth in the cisplatin-resistant cell these results suggest that bbi and bbic could be useful agents for the treatment of especially with in tumors resistant to this important anticancer
physical association between cd155 and cd44 in human regulation of cd44-mediated binding to hyaluronan is critical in normal and diseased immune cell in earlier work by others (shepley and 1301 anti-cd44 mab blocked poliovirus binding to cd155 (the poliovirus receptor) in hela suggesting that cd155 and cd44 may be physically we present evidence that cd155 and cd44 are physically associated in human in co-modulation experiments in u937 monocytic cd155 and cd44 reciprocally in primary human cd 155 syn-capped with in immunofluorescence flow cytometric anti cd44 mab inhibited up to 94% of binding by anti-cd155 mab which blocks poliovirus binding to this inhibition was specific for culturing monocytes increased the extent of in mab against a novel molecule that is related to cd was inhibited by anti-cd44 in a dose-dependent but not by these data support the interpretation that cd155 (and related proteins) are physically associated with cd44 on monocyte cell although the current study does not address functional we speculate that this interaction may have a role in regulating monocyte cd44 ligand binding which may be critical in pathological processes such as tumor metastasis and
ionic mechanisms underlying human atrial action potential insights from a mathematical the mechanisms underlying many important properties of the human atrial action potential (ap) are poorly using specific formulations of the and ca2+ currents based on data recorded from human atrial along with representations of and background we developed a mathematical model of the the model ap resembles aps recorded from human atrial samples and responds to rate l-type ca2+ current na+/ca2+ exchanger and variations in transient outward current amplitude in a fashion similar to experimental rate-dependent adaptation of ap an important determinant of susceptibility to atrial was attributable to incomplete l-type ca2+ current recovery from inactivation and incomplete delayed rectifier current deactivation at rapid experimental observations of variable ap morphology could be accounted for by changes in transient outward current as suggested we conclude that this mathematical model of the human atrial ap reproduces a variety of observed ap behaviors and provides insights into the mechanisms of clinically important ap
physiological concentrations of melatonin inhibit the norepinephrine-induced activation of prostaglandin e2 and cyclic amp production in rat a mechanism involving inhibiton of nitric oxide in this we summarize the results of in vitro studies showing that physiological concentrations of melatonin inhibit the norepinephrine-induced activation of prostaglandin e2 (pge2) and cyclic amp production in rat medial basal hypothalamus a concentration of melatonin as low as 1 which is roughly equivalent to the nocturnal serum physiological concentration of the hormone in the significantly inhibit pge2 and cyclic amp production in the the suppressive effect of melatonin may be mediated by an inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (nos) since the stimulatory effect of sodium nitroprusside a spontaneous generator of was not prevented by melatonin also inhibited nos activity in rat mbh in a dose-dependent the results suggest the existence of a new or an ancillary means by which melatonin may regulate the physiology of the hypothalamus-pituitary
activated granulocytes oxidize the endogenous stem cell inhibitory peptide pglu-glu-asp-cys-lys (peedck) to the stimulatory a redox-mediated mechanism for demand-induced hematopoietic we have previously shown that the pentapeptide pglu-glu-asp-cys-lys which is associated with mature maintains pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (colony-forming units-spleen [cfu-s]) in a quiescent state under physiological it is also known that its oxidation the disulfide-bonded homodimer is a growth factor for cfu-s in in this paper we report on the combined actions of the monomer and dimer in inducing rapid changes in stem cell proliferation in a single injection of 20 microg/kg synthetic dimer into mice stimulated cfu-s proliferation (60% in s-phase after 9-11 hours) and population stimulated cfu-s traversed one cell with an estimated s-phase time of and then become quiescent proliferation of cfu-s in response to dimer showed no sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of monomeric whereas cfu-s proliferation did display sensitivity to inhibition after injection of cytosine arabinoside or products of mature granulocytes undergoing an oxidative burst reaction rapidly oxidized monomeric peedck to the the suppressive effect of endogenous peedck monomer on stem cell proliferation was thus converted within minutes to a stimulatory signal because many in vivo situations infection) requiring increased hematopoiesis involve granulocyte and macrophage the formation of dimer from endogenous peedck monomer may provide an almost instantaneous demand-induced emergency signal for increasing stem cell proliferation and blood cell
inhibition of human immunodeficiency type 1 virus replication in monocytic u-937 cells by superinfection with chlamydia the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of infection of monocytic cells with both the human immunodeficiency type 1 virus (hiv-1) and chlamydia trachomatis on the replication of each u-937 chronically infected with hiv-1 (strain either induced to differentiate into immature macrophage-like cells by 32 pm 12-o-tetradecanol phorbol-13-acetate or were superinfected with trachomatis serovar both hiv-1 infection and differentiation rendered the u-937 cells highly susceptible to trachomatis lytic differentiation and superinfection of hiv-1-infected cells with trachomatis both affected cell viability and reduced viral production in rt activity was one tenth the original value after differentiation of hiv-1-infected one twentieth the original value after superinfection with and one hundredth the original value after differentiation and superinfection with

chronic treatment of human fibroblasts cultures with diacylglycerol induces down-regulation of p53 functional we found that many spontaneous human tumors exhibit increased levels of endocellular diacylglycerol (dag) which is synthesized de novo as a byproduct of it has been shown that dag mimics phorbol esters as a full tumor promoter in mouse skin a short term dag treatment activates protein kinase c while a long term treatment down-regulates we show here that chronic treatment of human fibroblast with dag induces p53 down-regulation and inhibition of p53 functional and protection from uv-induced as pkc phosphorylation is necessary for p53 functional we propose that chronic dag treatment mimics the same event occurring in vivo for the effect of glycolysis in tumor
adenoviral-mediated inhibition of g beta gamma signaling limits the hyperplastic response in experimental vein vein graft intimal hyperplasia is associated with changes in g protein the carboxyl terminus of the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase-1 (beta arkct) is known to inhibit g beta gamma-mediated mitogen-activated signaling this study examines the effects of adenoviral-mediated beta arkct infection on the development of intimal hyperplasia in vein new zealand white rabbits underwent bypass grafting of the carotid artery with the jugular vein grafts were infected with adenoviral vectors encoding for beta arkct (n = beta-galactosidase (n = or empty viral constructs (n = in control vein grafting was performed without infection (n = the efficacy of beta arkct infection in vein grafts was verified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain x-gal staining of beta-galactosidase-infected vein grafts demonstrated the transgene in cells throughout the vessel adenoviral infection of vein grafts without gene transfer did not alter wall thicknesses or sensitivities to contractile compared with control beta arkct reduced intimal thickness by 36% (p < and medial thickness by 24% (p < compared with empty viral beta arkct-infected vein grafts also demonstrated increased sensitivity in response to contractile these results show that inhibition of g beta gamma signaling with adenoviral-mediated beta arkct in vivo infection effectively modifies the structural and functional hyperplastic abnormalities in vein
inhibition of lung surfactant secretion by a specific inhibitor of the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase a role of ca(2+)- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camk ii) in lung surfactant secretion was evaluated using a specific inhibitor of camk kn-62 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of ca2+ iononphore a23187-stimulated phosphatidylcholine (pc) secretion from cultured alveolar type ii concentration effecting 50% inhibition was approximately 4 kn-62 only slightly influenced pc secretion from type ii cells stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate terbutaline and atp that are known to increase surfactant secretion via the protein kinase c and protein kinase a kn-62 also inhibited the activity of camk ii in type ii a 55 kda protein was detected in type ii cells by western blot analysis using an antibody against the beta-subunit of camk the results suggest that camk ii participates in a23187-stimulated lung surfactant
evidence that protein kinase cepsilon mediates phorbol ester inhibition of calphostin c- and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced apoptosis in u937 histiocytic lymphoma protein kinase c (pkc) such as the tumor-promoting phorbol have been reported to protect several cell lines from apoptosis induced by a variety of recent evidence suggests that pkcepsilon is involved in protection of cardiac myocytes from hypoxia-induced cell death and (1997) we investigated the protective effects of the phorbol ester 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (tpa) on u937 histiocytic lymphoma cells induced to undergo apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) or by the specific pkc inhibitor calphostin u937 cells were transiently permeabilized with a peptide (epsilonv1-2) derived from the v1 region of pkcepsilon that has been reported to specifically block translocation of the epsilonv1-2 peptide blocked the inhibitory effect of tpa on both tnf-alpha- and calphostin c-induced a scrambled version of epsilonv1-2 and a peptide reported to inhibit pkcbeta translocation (betac2-4) had no effect on the ability of tpa to inhibit these results suggest that pkcepsilon is required for the protective effect of tpa in tnf-alpha- and calphostin c-induced calphostin c reduced membrane-associated pkcepsilon activity and suggesting that pkcepsilon may play an important role in leukemic cell
effects of ltd4 on human airway smooth muscle cell matrix and contraction in differential sensitivity to cysteinyl leukotriene receptor the cysteinyl leukotrienes (cyslts) mimic many of the features of asthma and are implicated in its is known about the effects of the cyslts on airways in this study the effects of leukotriene d4 (ltd4) on human airway smooth muscle (hasm) cell proliferation and expression of extracellular matrix proteins were ltd4 microm) alone had no effect on dna synthesis in markedly augmented proliferation induced by the epidermal growth factor 1 the potentiating effect of ltd4 (1 microm) on egf-induced dna synthesis was abolished by pranlukast (1 microm) or pobilukast (30 but unaffected by zafirlukast (1 in pranlukast (pkb = pobilukast (pkb = and zafirlukast (pkb = had equivalent potencies for inhibition of ltd4-induced contraction in human ltd4 or 10 microm) did not increase the total messenger rna expression of the extracellular matrix proteins (pro-alpha[i] type i or alpha1[iv] type iv and and did not influence tumor growth factor-beta (10 ng/ml)-induced effects on the expression of these proteins in hasm these data indicate that ltd4 augments growth factor-induced hasm proliferation but does not alter the expression of various extracellular matrix the observed differences in sensitivity to the antagonists suggests that the former phenomenon may be mediated by a cyslt receptor distinct from that which mediates ltd4-induced hasm these results provide preliminary evidence that cyslts may play a role in airways remodeling in
