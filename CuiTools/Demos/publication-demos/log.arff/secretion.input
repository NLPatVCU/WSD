interleukin-12- and interleukin-2-stimulated release of interferon-gamma by uterine cd56++ large granular lymphocytes is amplified by decidual numerous studies have suggested that interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) exhibits an inhibitory effect on conceptus development during and recent investigations have shown that decidual cd16- large granular lymphocytes (lgl) contain mrna for we have investigated the influence of exogenous interleukin-12 (il-12) and interleukin-2 (il-2) on ifn-gamma secretion by cultivated lgl and macrophages isolated from first trimester human the effect of decidual macrophages on ifn-gamma secretion by lgl was also assessed using co-incubation neither il-12 nor il-2 stimulated the secretion of ifn-gamma by decidual il-12 but not il-2 stimulated the release of ifn-gamma by il-2 acted synergistically with il-12 to enhance the release of ifn-gamma by unstimulated and il-12- and il-2-stimulated lgl incubated with macrophages exhibited a marked increase in secretion of ifn-gamma compared to those in this effect was also seen when the lgl and macrophages were separated by a semi-permeable the results suggest that interactions between decidual lgl and possibly mediated by soluble could play a role in regulating ifn-gamma secretion at the materno-fetal interface and thus contribute to the control of invasion by the
nonenzymatic glycation of type i collagen modifies interaction with umr 201-10b preosteoblastic advanced glycation endproduct whose formation is accelerated on long lived extracellular matrix proteins in is implicated in diabetic complications in various type i collagen is the predominant matrix protein of bone and plays an important role in bone cell-matrix we have previously reported the accelerated accumulation of age collagen in bone tissue in diabetes mellitus in which reduced bone mineral density was in when cultures of mature primary rat osteoblasts were plated onto an in vitro age-modified collagen they showed altered cell in terms of alkaline phosphatase (alp) osteocalcin and nodule formation (j bone miner res to determine whether age collagen might also affect differentiation of we compared the effects of plating the preosteoblastic umr 201-10b cell line onto age-modified collagen with plating onto unmodified the latter had been shown previously to promote differentiation of umr 201 we have also explored whether these effects might be partly mediated by the transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta) growth of umr 201-10b cells on a type i collagen substrate significantly inhibited cell growth and retinoic acid (ra)-induced upregulation of alp compared to cells on these inhibitory effects were reduced by prior glycation of in a dose-dependent manner with respect to age unmodified collagen stimulated production of osteopontin which was reduced by age modification to levels attained in cells on growth on control collagen inhibited tgf-beta type ii receptor binding in 10b while this inhibition was reduced by age these data suggest that glycation of collagen interferes with specific interaction(s) between umr 201-10b cells and based on our previous results in umr 201 these results would be compatible with the notion that glycated collagen has reduced ability to promote differentiation of preosteoblasts to mature these data further suggest that collagen-mediated events in these cells may be at least in part mediated by regulation of the tgf-beta receptor

a novel heregulin isoform that is an autocrine growth factor for the human breast cancer cell a novel neuregulin termed was cloned and characterized from the human breast cancer cell as observed with other is a product of alternative mrna splicing of the neuregulin gamma-hrg contains the egf-like and immunoglobulin-like domains that are commonly found in other family but lacks a transmembrane and cytoplasmic the new isoform possesses a unique n-terminal region that includes a hydrophobic domain that may function as a secretion a purified recombinant version of gamma-hrg competes for binding to soluble erbb3- and erbb4-igg fusion proteins with affinities similar to those observed for gamma-hrg has a wide distribution in mesenchymal or neuronal tissues but in contrast to other it is not present in liver and small expression of gamma-hrg with its cognate erbb3 and erbb2 suggested that the growth of the mda-mb-175 cell line might be a result of the autocrine stimulation of a growth factor signaling treatment of mda-mb-175 cells with an anti-erbb2 monoclonal antibody that interferes with the ligand-dependent formation of erbb2-erbb3 heterodimer complexes shows a strong growth inhibitory effect on this cell incubation with a receptor-igg fusion protein that neutralizes secreted also inhibits cell these data suggest that the secretion of gamma-hrg by mda-mb-175 cells leads to the formation of a constitutively active receptor complex and stimulates the growth of these cells in an autocrine
n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein contains high and low affinity atp-binding sites that are functionally n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (nsf) has been shown to be involved in numerous intracellular membrane fusion events of both the regulated and constitutive secretory sequence analysis indicates that the nsf subunit contains two nucleotide-binding both with the classical walker a and b in this we examine the nucleotide binding properties of the homotrimer contains three high affinity atp-binding sites with kd = 30-40 nm for atp and kd = 2 microm for this class of binding sites did not bind or a second class of lower affinity nucleotide binding sites with a kd = 15-20 microm was also using various mutant forms of the high affinity nucleotide-binding sites were localized to the d2 domains and the low affinity sites were localized to the d1 functionally it is these lower affinity sites in d1 that are crucial for nsf nucleotide concentration greatly affected the ability of nsf to interact with (soluble nsf attachment protein-snap receptor) suggesting that only when the d1 domain atp-binding sites are occupied does nsf bind to the
macrophages promote prosclerotic responses in cultured rat mesangial a mechanism for the initiation of glomerulosclerosis is the final outcome of a number of different causes of glomerular during which the structures of the glomerulus are obliterated by extracellular accumulating evidence suggests that infiltrating macrophages play a pivotal role in the progression to the present study defines the role played by macrophages at both cellular and molecular levels in the initiation of the sclerotic process in cultured rat mesangial macrophage-conditioned medium (mpcm) generated from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages upregulated mesangial cell fibronectin production in a dose- and time-dependent independently of cell immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled 35s-fibronectin confirmed that the matrix protein was synthesized de the genes for fibronectin and the matrix proteins laminin and collagen iv were also found to be upregulated +/- +/- and +/- over respectively (p < macrophage modulation of matrix turnover was suggested by an upregulation of both transin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 gene transforming growth factor (tgf) platelet-derived growth tumor necrosis factor (tnf) or interleukin (il)-1beta could not be detected in the mpcm per tgfbeta1 and platelet-derived growth factor ab were found to be secreted into mesangial cell culture secretion was augmented +/- and +/- respectively (both p < in response to northern blot analysis demonstrated that protein secretion had been preceded by upregulation of the genes for these cytokines +/- [p < and +/- [p < incubation of mpcm with either neutralizing antibody or the growth factor receptor antagonist suramin demonstrated that tgfbeta1 played a although role in mpcm-stimulated fibronectin in this study provides compelling evidence for a direct role of macrophages in the progression to
effects of nitroprusside and nicorandil on catecholamine secretion and calcium mobilization in cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin the effects of nitroprusside and nicorandil on catecholamine secretion and free intracellular ca2+ ([ca2+]i) mobilization in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were studied to evaluate the role of the nitric oxide (no)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cgmp) pathway in the regulation of a [ca2+]i-dependent secretory these effects were compared with those of a typical voltage-dependent ca2+ channel carbachol produced a rapid increase followed by a sustained increase of [ca2+]i (ca2+ transient) in cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin both nitroprusside and nicorandil accelerated the decrease in [ca2+]i without changing the peak values of the initial [ca2+]i increase of ca2+ these did not affect carbachol-induced catecholamine suggesting that secretion is related to the initial [ca2+]i increase and not to a late sustained [ca2+]i nifedipine reduced the peak and duration of carbachol-induced [ca2+]i increases and decreased the secretion of diethylamine/no an no and dibutyryl-cgmp produced similar changes in ca2+ transient and did not alter catecholamine suggesting that the effects of nitroprusside and nicorandil were mediated by the no/cgmp these results indicated that the pattern of ca2+ especially the initial increase in is important in secretion of
identification of genes controlling growth polarity in the budding yeast saccharomyces a possible role of n-glycosylation and involvement of the exocyst the regulation of secretion polarity and cell surface growth during the cell cycle is critical for proper morphogenesis and viability of saccharomyces a shift from isotropic cell surface growth to polarized growth is necessary for bud emergence and a repolarization of secretion to the bud neck is necessary for cell although alterations in the actin cytoskeleton have been implicated in these changes in secretion clearly other cellular systems involved in secretion are likely to be targets of cell cycle to investigate mechanisms coupling cell cycle progression to changes in secretion polarity in parallel with and downstream of regulation of actin we implemented a screen for mutants defective specifically in polarized growth but with normal actin cytoskeleton these mutants fell into three those partially defective in those linked to specific defects in the and a third class neither defective in glycosylation nor linked to the these results raise the possibility that changes in n-linked glycosylation may be involved in a signal linking cell cycle progression and secretion polarity and that the exocyst may have regulatory functions in coupling the secretory machinery to the polarized actin
signals transduced through the cd4 molecule interfere with tcr/cd3-mediated ras activation leading to t cell it has been previously demonstrated that the occupancy of cd4 molecules by the hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 results in marked inhibition of t cell receptor-cd3 complex (tcr/cd3) activation-induced il-2 to elucidate the mechanism of inhibitory effects of gp160 on t cell we have investigated the intracellular biochemical events and biological output in response to anti-cd3 mab activation of purified peripheral blood cd4+ t cells from healthy donors with and without prior exposure to hiv-1 pretreatment with gp160 resulted in marked inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of ras and tnf-alpha secretion in anti-cd3 mab activated cd4+ t and a subset of cd4+ cells underwent activation-induced cell the data presented here provide insight into the mechanism by which the interaction of hiv-1 envelope glycoproteins with cd4 molecules may alter tcr/cd3-activation-induced signal transduction resulting in anergy and apoptosis with consequent functional deficiency of cd4+ t copyright 1997 academic

effects of antimitotic agents on secretion and detergent extractibility of adrenal nicotinic acetylcholine evidence exists that associations of adrenal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs) with the cytoskeleton play an important role in signal transduction pathways by maintaining these receptors in a functional these studies were designed to explore this possibility and elucidate the mechanism by which antimitotic agents inhibit activation of adrenal functional studies demonstrated that and demecolcine inhibited nachr-stimulated catecholamine release noncompetitively and in a concentration-dependent with ic50 values of 3 5 8 and 19 (9-39) detergent extraction experiments indicated that approximately 36% of adrenal nachrs were associated with the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal when chromaffin cells were first treated with antimitotic agents and then detergent a significant reduction occurred in the population of adrenal nachrs associated with the detergent-insoluble these studies support an association of adrenal nachrs with microtubules and suggest that the mechanism by which the antimitotic drugs interfere with the signal transduction pathway is by inducing dissociation of nachrs from the microtubular
how do cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mutations produce lung in recent several functions of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator have been yet the pathophysiology of the pulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis remains at the cellular functions of this protein include regulation of chloride and sodium transport at the cell membrane and in intracellular regulation of protein and posttranslational processing of elucidation of these functions has led to several hypotheses to account for how defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator produce pulmonary but a clear understanding of the pathophysiologic links between the cellular functions of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and organ dysfunction has been hampered by the lack of ideal model current evidence suggests that defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator lead to alterations in periciliary fluid mucus mucin and apical membrane protein in these alterations impair mucociliary clearance and promote bacterial which then leads to chronic airway inflammation and the development of
helix-loop-helix motif in gnrh associated peptide is critical for negative regulation of prolactin the gnrh associated prolactin inhibiting factor (gap) reveals the signature sequence associated with the helix-loop-helix structural a number of different peptide fragments of gap were synthesized and analysed by circular dichroism and by an in vivo assay for prolactin secretion inhibiting peptides corresponding to the two individual alpha-helices and a 44-residue peptide comprising the entire helix-loop-helix motif show significant helical propensity in circular dichroism a peptide corresponding to the loop sequence shows no helical the peptide corresponding to helix-loop-helix motif was found to inhibit prolactin secretion and augment circulating levels of gonadotropins in the in vivo other shorter peptides did not show such the activity profile of the 44-residue peptide was biphasic and very similar to that of the recombinant the prolactin inhibiting activity of this factor is defined by its helix-loop-helix motif as in the case of the transcription factors of developmental the structural features of a homology-based model of gap in complex with a ubiquitous hlh-type developmental gene are consistent with the structural requirements of the negative regulation of transcription by helix-loop-helix
human cystatin c forms an inactive dimer during intracellular trafficking in transfected cho to define the cellular processing of human cystatin c as well as to lay the groundwork for investigating its contribution to lcelandic hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis we have characterized the and extracellular fate of human cystatin c in transfected chinese hamster ovary (cho) it is constitutively secreted with an intracellular half-life of 72 gel filtration of cell lysates revealed the presence of three cystatin c immunoreactive an 11 kda species corresponding to monomeric cystatin a 33 kda complex that is most likely dimeric cystatin c and immunoreactive > or = 70 whose composition is intracellular monomeric cystatin c is functionally active as a cysteine protease while the dimer is medium from the transfected cho cells contained only active monomeric cystatin c indicating that the cystatin c formed during intracellular is converted to monomer at or before cells in which exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (er) was blocked with brefeldin a contained the 33 kda indicating that cystatin c dimerization occurs in the after removal of brefeldin there was a large increase in intracellular monomer suggesting that dimer dissociation occurs later in the secretion after exiting the er but prior to release from the extracellular monomeric cystatin c was found to be internalized into lysosomes where it again presumably as a consequence of the low ph of late as a cystatin c would be prevented from inhibiting the lysosomal cysteine these results reveal a novel transient by which cystatin c is inactivated during the early part of its trafficking through the secretory pathway and then reactivated prior to its uptake by the cell also leads to its redimerization in the lysosomal
immunolocalization of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid cytochrome p450 17 and cytochrome p450 aromatase in the equine corpus luteum of dioestrus and early the onset of equine chorionic gonadotrophin (ecg) secretion in pregnant mares is associated with an increase in luteal androgen and oestrogen the luteal cell type(s) responsible for the increased production of androgens and oestrogens has not been identified in the equine corpus in this we examined the pattern of expression of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 cytochrome p450 17 (p450(17 alpha)) and cytochrome p450 aromatase (p450arom) by immunohistochemistry in equine luteal tissue collected during dioestrus (days n = 4) and early before (days n = 4) and after (days n = 4) the onset of endogenous ecg all luteal cells expressed 3 p450(17 alpha) and the distribution of 3 p450(17 alpha) and p450arom did not differ with stage of the reproductive the intensity of immunohistochemical staining for 3 beta-hsd did not appear to differ with reproductive in the intensity of immunostaining for p450(17 alpha) increased after the onset of ecg the intensity of immunostaining for p450arom increased during pregnancy before the onset of ecg secretion and diminished after the onset of ecg secretion to the intensity seen in dioestrous corpora this finding suggests that androgen and oestrogen production is not compartmentalized within the equine corpus both large and small luteal cells express the steroidogenic enzymes necessary for oestrogen and the intensity of immunostaining for p450(17 alpha) and p450arom appears to be
neurotrophin release by implications for activity-dependent neuronal secreted in an activity-dependent are thought to be involved in the activity-dependent refinement of synaptic here we demonstrate that in hippocampal neurons and the rat pheochromocytoma cell line pc12 application of exogenous neurotrophins induces secretion of an effect that is mediated by the activation of tyrosine kinase neurotrophin receptors like activity-dependent secretion of neurotrophin-induced neurotrophin secretion requires mobilization of calcium from intracellular because neurotrophins are likely to be released from both dendrites and neurotrophin-induced neurotrophin release represents a potential positive feedback contributing to the reinforcement and stabilization of synaptic
influence of residual c-peptide secretion on nocturnal serum tsh peak in well-controlled diabetic several alterations in hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid (hpt) function have been described in diabetes mellitus and have been attributed to metabolic the present study was performed in order to establish whether residual endogenous insulin secretion in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm) may play a role in the control of hpt the nocturnal (2230 h-0200 h) serum tsh the tsh response to trh (200 microgram as an bolus) and serum free thyroid hormone levels were evaluated in c-peptide positive (cpp) (subjects with residual detectable endogenous pancreatic beta-cell activity) and c-peptide negative (cpn) patients both before and after optimization of metabolic status by 3 days of treatment with continuous subcutaneous insulin and in normal tsh response to trh and serum free thyroid hormone levels were assessed in the twenty male diabetic patients hospitalized to achieve a better control of hyperglycaemia were subdivided into 10 cpp 33 +/- years (mean +/- body mass index +/- and 10 cpn 32 +/- +/- nine normal men +/- +/- served as the nocturnal serum tsh peak was measured by dividing the highest night-time tsh value by the next morning tsh value and then multiplying by serum tsh levels were measured in samples taken just before (time 0) and 30 after trh serum free thyroid hormone levels were measured in samples taken at time 0 of the trh before improvement of cpp and cpn patients showed similar alterations in hpt serum free t3 levels and tsh responses to trh were lower than the nocturnal tsh surge was correction of hyperglycaemia normalized all examined hpt parameters in cpp whereas normalization in serum free t3 levels and pituitary tsh responsiveness to trh in cpn patients was not accompanied by restoration of the nocturnal tsh these data indicate that the absence of residual pancreatic beta-cell function in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is associated with neuroendocrine dysfunction in the regulation of circadian tsh which is not reversible after restoration of good glycaemic
reconstitution of high affinity ige receptor-mediated secretion by transfecting protein tyrosine kinase to study the role of the focal adhesion tyrosine kinase (fak) in receptor-mediated we transfected fak cdna into a variant (3b6) of the rbl-2h3 mast cell this 3b6 cell line expressed low levels of fak and was defective in high affinity ige receptor (fcepsilonri) but not ca2+ ionophore-mediated fcepsilonri-mediated secretion was reconstituted after transfection of wild-type histamine release was also enhanced by the stable expression of two mutants of a kinase-inactive form in which the atp binding site lys-454 was replaced by arg or a mutant in which the autophosphorylation site tyr-397 was replaced by the catalytic activity and the autophosphorylation site of fak are not essential for fcepsilonri aggregation increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of both mutants of fak to the same extent as wild-type tyrosine kinases activated by fcepsilonri aggregation are phosphorylating fak and some of these phosphorylation sites are other than these results strongly suggest that fak plays a role in fcepsilonri-induced secretion by functioning as an adapter or linker
elevated calcium and activation of trypsinogen in rat pancreatic acute pancreatitis associated with hypercalcaemia has been described in humans and experimental it has been demonstrated that calcium dose dependently accelerates trypsinogen and it is generally believed that ectopic activation of digestive enzymes is an early event in the pathophysiology of acute aims and trypsinogen activation peptide (tap) was measured in isolated rat pancreatic acini exposed to elevated extracellular calcium in order to investigate the association between calcium and trypsinogen activation in living tap was determined in the culture medium either before (extracellular compartment) or after (intracellular compartment) cell neither secretory stimulation nor elevated calcium alone caused an increase in tap maximal cerulein or carbachol stimulation superimposed on high medium significantly increased intracellular trypsinogen activation this increase was inhibited by either ng-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-nmma) or acinar cell morphology and function remained intact as demonstrated by electron microscopy and secretagogue dose-response these results support the hypothesis that increased intracellular trypsinogen activation is an early step in the pathogenesis of hypercalcaemia induced the model may have a bearing on other types of pancreatitis as elevated cytosolic calcium is thought to be an early event in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis in
leptin inhibits in vitro hypothalamic somatostatin secretion and somatostatin mrna the product of the ob is a recently discovered hormone secreted by adipocytes that regulates food intake and energy the site of action of leptin is likely to be the since this area is important in the control of food intake and leptin receptor mrna is particularly abundant in this in order to further unravel the mechanisms by which leptin we have studied the effect of leptin on in vitro somatostatin synthesis and leptin administration to fetal rat neurones in monolayer culture led to a time dependent decrease in basal somatostatin secretion and somatostatin mrna the maximal effect being observed with 6x10(-8) m leptin after 24 h leptin completely blunted 10(-7) m neuropeptide y-induced increase in somatostatin secretion and somatostatin mrna levels as well as 10(-3) m (bu)2-camp and 10(-6) m a23187-induced somatostatin leptin (3x10(-8) m m) also inhibited low glucose mm) induced-somatostatin secretion in perifused adult this data indicates that leptin can influence the neuroendocrine system by regulating hypothalamic somatostatin gene
multi-responsiveness of single anterior pituitary cells to hypothalamic-releasing a cellular basis for paradoxical the classic view for hypothalamic regulation of anterior pituitary (ap) hormone secretion holds that release of each ap hormone is controlled specifically by a corresponding hypothalamic-releasing hormone in this binding of a given hrh growth and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormones) to specific receptors in its target cell increases the concentration of cytosolic ca2+ thereby selectively stimulating the release of the appropriate responses of ap cells to the four well-established hrhs have been observed repeatedly with both in vivo and in vitro raising the possibility of functional overlap between the different ap cell to explore this we evaluated the effects of hrhs on [ca2+]i in single ap cells identified immunocytochemically by the hormone they we found that each of the five major ap cell types contained discrete subpopulations that were able to respond to several the relative abundance of these multi-responsive cells was 59% for 33% for and in the range of 47-55% for and analysis of prolactin release from single living cells revealed that each of the four hrhs tested were able to induce hormone release from a discrete lactotrope the size of which corresponded closely to that in which [ca2+]i changes were induced by the same when viewed as a our diverse functional measurements of multi-responsiveness suggest that hypothalamic control of pituitary function is more complicated than previously they provide a cellular basis for the so-called behavior of pituitary cells to hypothalamic hypophysiotropic

decreased nocturnal secretion of melatonin in drug-free no change after subchronic treatment with to evaluate the biosynthetic activity of the pineal gland in the circadian rhythm of plasma melatonin was investigated in 9 drug-free chronic schizophrenics and in matched healthy in 7 of the the 24-hour secretory pattern of the pineal hormone was reassessed after 10 weeks of treatment with antipsychotic in drug-free the nocturnal increase in plasma melatonin levels was significantly blunted as compared to healthy subjects (p < chronic treatment with antipsychotic drugs significantly improved psychotic but did not change the secretory pattern of these data show that the biosynthetic activity of the pineal gland is impaired in chronic schizophrenia and that successful treatment with antipsychotic drugs does not go parallel with changes in the production of
lack of linkage between the corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh) gene and bipolar affective corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh) plays a key role in the regulation of the stress abnormalities in crh secretion have been documented in both the depression and manic phases of bipolar disorder in the present we investigated genetic linkage between the crh gene and bpd in 22 a highly short tandem repeat (str) polymorphism adjacent to the crh gene on human chromosomal region 8q13 was used to examine affected sibling pair (asp) and the likelihood-based disequilibrium tests revealed nonsignificant we conclude that the crh gene is not linked to if genes involved in the regulation of stress response are indeed linked to the search should be directed towards those that regulate crh secretion or its effects on target
somatostatin receptor (sstr) subtype-selective analogues differentially suppress in vitro growth hormone and prolactin in human pituitary novel potential therapy for functional pituitary we have shown somatostatin receptor (sstr) subtype-specific regulation of growth hormone thyroid-stimulating and prolactin (prl) secretion in human fetal pituitary where gh and thyroid-stimulating hormone are mediated by both sstr2 and whereas sstr2 preferentially mediates prl we now tested sstr subtype-selective analogues in primary human gh- and prl-secreting pituitary adenoma analogue affinities determined by membrane radioligand binding in cells stably expressing human sstr forms were either sstr2 or analogues preferential either for including and novel compounds with improved affinity for or new sstr5-selective compounds suppressed gh in tumor cell cultures (up to 44% of p < novel analogues from both groups were 30-40% more potent than octreotide and lanreotide in suppressing gh (p < heterologous analogue combinations containing both sstr2- and sstr5-selective compounds were more potent in decreasing gh than analogues used alone (p < or than combinations of compounds specific for the same receptor subtype (p < in sstr2-selective analogues did not suppress prl release from six cultured prolactinomas new sstr5-selective analogues suppressed in vitro prl secretion p < in four of six these results suggest that both sstr2 and sstr5 are involved in gh regulation in somatotroph adenoma whereas sstr5 exclusively regulates prl secretion from prolactinoma somatostatin analogues with improved selective binding affinity for these receptor subtypes may be effective in the treatment of either gh- or prl-secreting
mechanisms for de novo biogenesis of an apical membrane compartment in groups of simple epithelial cells surrounded by extracellular in open monolayers of epithelial cells grown in the apical membrane domain forms on the free cell surface that faces the culture in the apical lumenal compartment arises within groups of cells that do not have a free cell we designed in vitro culture using small colonies of mdck cells overlaid with in which formation of the apical membrane must occur de novo by remodeling existing membrane domains that are contacted by other cells or extracellular within 12 hours of collagen the apical membrane glycoprotein gp135 is removed from the free cell while lateral membrane proteins remain at sites of cell-cell lumenal containing gp135 and the apically secreted protein formed within these cell-cell adherens junction alpha- and beta-catenins) and tight junction (zo-1) proteins were localized on the lateral membrane adjacent but excluded from the gp135-positive lumenal each lumen represents a newly formed apical compartment on the lateral the golgi complex (alpha-mannosidase ii and golgi centrosomes (gamma-tubulin) and microtubules reorient to a cytoplasmic position adjacent to the newly-forming apical lumenal addition of nocodazole or brefeldin a inhibits apical lumen these results demonstrate that simple epithelial cells form an apical lumenal compartment de novo through initial and then sorting of apical and basal-lateral membrane proteins at sites of cell-cell in apical lumen formation requires an intact microtubule microtubule-dependent reorientation of the golgi complex and secretory and fully functional protein delivery from the golgi complex to the forming apical cell
cortisol and tgf-beta inhibit secretion of platelet-activating factor-acetylhydrolase in a monocyte-macrophage model system [corrected] [published erratum appears in mol hum reprod 1998 recent studies have suggested that platelet activating factor (paf) plays an important role in various reproductive including implantation and and that the local concentration of paf is modulated by paf-acetylhydrolase a potent paf in this we investigated the possible effects of various bioactive which are present at high concentrations in the human pregnant on paf-ah secretion from decidual macrophages using a monocyte-macrophage model human myelocytic leukaemia cells by treatment with 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate hl-60 cells were transformed to macrophage-like which secreted paf-ah into the culture medium time- and after treatment with 10(-8) m the effects of various substances on the secretion of paf-ah were among the substances cortisol and tgf-beta suppressed paf-ah secretion from tpa-stimulated hl-60 cells in a significant and dose-dependent epidermal growth and brain natriuretic peptide had no significant effect on paf-ah secretion from tpa-stimulated hl-60 these results suggest that local paf concentrations in the pregnant uterus might be at least by cortisol and thus these substances may play a role in the initiation of parturition via regulation of local paf

the proteinase-antiproteinase theory of a speculative analysis of recent advances into the pathogenesis of this review concerns the reasons why only an estimated 10-15% of patients with alpha-1-antitrypsin (a1at) deficiency develop the destructive lung disease known as the arguments presented revolve around the proteinase-antiproteinase balance in the of the epithelial space of the attention is focused on the balance between destructive enzymes such as neutrophil elastase and protective proteins such as secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor human elastase inhibitor (hei) and when neutrophil elastase is already attached to the elastin fibres the smaller molecules slpi and elafin appear to be better inhibitors of this enzyme than larger inhibitors such as a1at and slpi and elafin may provide the first line of defence against proteinase attack from neutrophil in trying to explain the variability in the clinical expression of a1at-deficiency and the development of the importance of changes to slpi and elafin molecules induced by smoking and/or oxygen free radicals has been it is possible that emphysema only develops in patients who have slpi/elafin deficiency as well as a1at
the involvement of the gh/igf-i axis in the regulation of secretory activity by bovine oviduct epithelial the aim of this study was to investigate the role of the gh/igf-i system in the control of secretory activity by oviductal the effects of gh 100 and 1000 ng/ml medium) on igf-i as well as the action of gh and igf-i 100 ng/ml medium) on camp and prostaglandin f alpha (pgf) secretion by cultured bovine oviduct epithelial cells were it was observed that gh at all doses tested significantly (p < increased igf-i both gh and igf-i significantly stimulated camp production by oviductal on the other pgf release was significantly (p < inhibited by both gh and igf-i at all concentrations our results demonstrate (1) oviductal cells can produce pgf camp and (2) production of pgf alpha is under inhibitory regulation by gh and (3) gh/igf can activate camp-dependent intracellular which might be the mediators of gh/igf-i action on oviductal these observations confirm the involvement of gh/igf-i system in control of oviductal prostaglandin and cyclic nucleotide
attaining dominance in distinguishing dominant from challenger follicles in this study provides the first report of local suppression of follicle growth in vivo by the dominant follicle in analyses were focused on antral follicles > or =6 mm in classified as dominant (ovulatory) and challenger non-ovulatory) we examined antral follicle interactions and location in the ovary in the follicular phase of ovulatory cycles in individual antral follicles (> or =2 mm) were identified and monitored using a developed by the incorporating mapping and computer modelling from ultrasound imaging of the results showed that antral follicle development was not restricted to a particular location in the the apparent randomization of location may provide a developmental advantage for the population of challenger follicles peaked at mid follicular suggesting a period when the ovarian environment was supportive of larger antral follicle as ovulation date challenger follicles did not attain the visible characteristics of mid-level large smooth antral round dominant follicles subsequently appeared to reduce the number of neighbouring challenger the results strongly suggest that a paracrine secretion of the dominant follicle was the source of this localized this process may provide increased nutrient level and space at a critical growth stage for dominant
immunolocalization of hsp60 in legionella one of the most abundant proteins synthesized by legionella particularly during growth in a variety of eukaryotic host is a member of the groel family of molecular the present study was initiated in response to a growing number of reports suggesting that for some including hsp60 may exist in extracytoplasmic immunolocalization techniques with hsp60-specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were used to define the subcellular location and distribution of hsp60 in pneumophila grown in or in vivo inside of hela for comparative purposes escherichia expressing recombinant pneumophila was in contrast to where hsp60 was localized exclusively in the in pneumophila hsp60 was predominantly associated with the cell conforming to a distribution pattern typical of surface molecules that included the major outer membrane protein omps and heat-shocked pneumophila organisms exhibited decreased overall levels of cell-associated hsp60 epitopes and increased relative levels of surface suggesting that hsp60 was released by stressed putative secretion of hsp60 by pneumophila was further indicated by the accumulation of hsp60 in the endosomal between replicating intracellular these results are consistent with an extracytoplasmic location for hsp60 in pneumophila and further suggest both the existence of a novel secretion mechanism (not present in coli) and a potential role in
il-1 beta and il-6 in mouse parotid acinar characterization of and and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-6 have not been established in normal exocrine gland secretory parotid glands and isolated acinar cells prepared from balb/c mice were homogenized for rna isolation and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction il-1 beta and il-6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas) were done on supernatants prepared from mouse parotid acinar cell (mpac) preparations unstimulated or stimulated between 0 and 10 min with 10(-5) m norepinephrine at 37 degrees mpacs were fixed in frozen sectioned for light and electron and labeled with antibodies to il-1 beta and mouse specific riboprobes to il-1 and il-6 were used for in situ rt-pcr yielded the expected il-1 (336-bp) and il-6 (614-bp) mrna by stimulated mpacs showed a significant increase in il-1 beta (p < and il-6 (p < release into supernatants by 10 min that paralleled the time course of amylase in situ hybridization showed the presence of transcripts for il-1 and il-6 in glandular epithelial gold-labeled il-1 beta and il-6 were significantly higher (p < in granules than in the nucleus and this study shows that mpacs synthesize il-1 beta and il-6 and release these cytokines from their granules after alpha- and beta-adrenergic
plasmalogens effectively reduce the surface tension of surfactant-like phospholipid the alkenyl-acyl subclass of phosphatidylethanolamine (ptdetn) and phosphatidylcholine (plasmalogens) are minor components of alveolar plasmalogens promote and stabilize hexagonal structures of in another study and science it was shown that polymorphic phase behavior may have an important role in the effective functioning of pulmonary we hypothesized that surface properties of phospholipid mixtures that contain plasmalogens are superior to plasmalogen-free the effect of plasmalogens on surface tension of surfactant-like phospholipid mixtures (70 mol% dipalmitoyl 10 mol% and 20 mol% ptdetn) was using the pulsating bubble we show that an increasing amount of ethanolamine plasmalogens [plasmenylethanolamine (plsetn) results in reduction of surface tension (0 mol% plsetn +/- 2 mol% +/- 4 mol% 36 +/- 6 mol% +/- and 8 mol% +/- by means of the captive bubble minimal surface tension reached with 8 mol% plsetn was even lower +/- with regard to morphological studies and cell clofibrate treatment of rats might increase the plasmalogen content of alveolar in the present we could not show that synthesis and secretion of plasmalogens are affected by clofibrate
gefarnate stimulates secretion of mucin-like glycoproteins by corneal epithelium in vitro and protects corneal epithelium from desiccation in the effect of drugs for gastritis and gastric ulcer (ecabet and troxipide) on the secretion of mucin-like glycoproteins from rat cornea were investigated in vitro and on a rabbit dry eye model in for the studies in cultured rat cornea sections (3 mm diameter) were incubated with radiolabeled sodium and then incubated for 30 min in the presence of one of the the culture media were reacted with dolichos biflorus agglutinate and the radioactivity of dba-bound mucin-like glycoproteins was a cytotoxicity assay confirmed that mucin-like glycoproteins had not leaked from damaged for studies in eye drop vehicle or drops containing gefarnate were instilled in the eyes of nine anesthetized and then the eyes were kept open with specula for two these rabbits and two control rabbits not subjected to ocular drying were and their eyes were enucleated and stained with methylene corneal epithelial damage from desiccation was evaluated based on the extent of methylene blue among the four kinds of drugs for gastritis and gastric only gefarnate significantly increased the mucin-like glycoprotein secretion from cultured rat corneas in this stimulatory effect of gefarnate was in the instillation of gefarnate reduced corneal epithelial damage from desiccation in a dose-dependent these results suggest that gefarnate reduces desiccation of corneal perhaps by stimulating secretion of mucin-like glycoproteins from corneal
immunostimulatory sequence-dependent production of potentially harmful or useful certain bacterial immunostimulatory dna sequences containing unmethylated cpg motifs stimulate antigen-presenting cells (apc) to express a full complement of costimulatory molecules and to produce cytokines including interleukin (il)-12 and tumor necrosis factor while il-12 is key to their t helper cell (th)1-promoting adjuvant secretion of toxic levels of tnf-alpha is harmful in that it promotes toxic given the beneficial as well as harmful consequences of we investigated the possibility of identifying dna cpg oligodeoxynucleotides (odn) which differentially activate il-12 versus tnf-alpha cytokine production in we describe an dna sequence with these while its potential to induce il-12 is its ability to trigger tnf-alpha release is strongly curtailed both in vitro and in dna could be segregated into lethal and non-lethal in a mouse toxic shock the non-toxic dna was useful as an thus allowing cytotoxic t cell responses to the soluble protein ovalbumin and conferring a resistant th 1 phenotype to balb/c mice lethally infected with leishmania this cpg motif may thus be prototypic for a useful immunostimulating dna sequence that lacks harmful side
[interrelationship between human cytomegalovirus infection and human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) infection is frequently associated with aids patients and immunocompromised recipients of organ the progression of hcmv infection is related to a complex interrelation of virus replication with the host immune including soluble and cellular a interleukin-8 is essentially involved in neutrophil-mediated tissue several chemokine receptors are co-receptor for hiv we investigated the effects of il-8 on hcmv replication in human embryonic mrc-5 il-8 augmented both infectious virus production and replication of with concomitant increases in the levels of both the hcmv pp71 genome and the synthesis of the hcmv late the enhancing effect of il-8 was observed at concentration from ng to 10 ng of showing a dose-response relationship similar to that observed in the neutrophil chemotactic activity of il-8 did not enhance the growth of mrc-5 indicating that il-8 enhanced hcmv replication and virus production without affecting the proliferation of host we also found that hcmv selectively induced transcripts of cxcr-1 in fibroblasts by but significant numbers of binding sites could not be detected on hcmv infected cells by using 125i-labeled il-8 may enhance hcmv replication in fibroblasts through interaction with small number of hcmv infection induced il-8 gene transcription in a human monocytic cell leading to il-8 it is unlikely that hcmv infection enhanced il-8 production indirectly by inducing the production of some soluble because virus-free filtrated hcmv or uv-irradiated hcmv infected supernatants failed to induce il-8 the functional analysis of the il-8 gene revealed that both ap-1 and nf-kb factor-binding element were involved in conferring the responsiveness to electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that the formation of ap-1 and nf-kb complex was observed upon hcmv these results suggest that il-8 produced upon hcmv may aggravate hcmv infection by enhancing its il-8 and cxcr-1 might be a novel target for intervention therapy for opportunistic hcmv
an antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide to m-calpain mrna inhibits secretion from alveolar epithelial type ii we investigated the effect of translational suppression of m-calpain on [3h]-phosphatidylcholine (pc) secretion utilising an antisense oligodexoyribonucleotide (oligo) directed against mrna encoding m-calpain catalytic two types of sense (s) and antisense to a portion of exon 12 of rat m-calpain catalytic subunit mrna were constitutive secretion was decreased by 23% by as-oligo (1 microm) while s-oligo (1 microm) had no tpa-stimulated secretion was inhibited about 50-60% by as-oligo (1-3 microm) and the inhibition was while s-oligo (1 microm) only inhibited about 10% of tpa-stimulated northern and western blot analyses revealed that the as-oligo treatment reduced m-calpain mrna and protein levels by 32% and the data indicate that antisense strategy is effective in suppressing calpain expression and type ii cell
effects of octreotide on glycaemic glucose hepatic glucose production and counterregulatory hormones secretion in type 1 and type 2 insulin treated diabetic we studied the effects of continuous subcutaneous infusion of octreotide (100 micrograms/day for 5 days) on glycaemic counterregulatory hormones hepatic glucose production (hgp) and glucose disposal during an euglycaemic clamp in 7 c-peptide-negative type 1 diabetic patients and 7 c-peptide positive insulin-treated type 2 diabetic in type but not type 2 diabetic octreotide significantly reduced glycaemic values (p < and also diminished hgp during an euglycaemic clamp (p < insulin stimulated global glucose uptake remained igfbp-3 were significantly lowered by octreotide in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients whereas cortisol and epinephrine remained moreover in type 2 diabetic patients both basal (p < and after-meal (p < c-peptide secretion was reduced by these data point to different metabolic effects of octreotide in type 1 versus type 2 diabetic patients with the drug only being able to reduce glycaemic values and hgp in the former but not in the latter the failure of octreotide to diminish glycaemic values and hgp in type 2 diabetic patients in spite of its ability to lower gh and glucagon may probably depend on temporary blockage of residual endogenous insulin secretion induced by octreotide
secretory acetylcholinesterase of setaria cervi microfilariae and its antigenic cross-reactivity with wuchereria setaria a bovine filarial secretes acetylcholinesterase during in vitro a significant amount of enzyme activity was detected both in culture media and somatic extracts of different developmental stages of the the microfilarial stage showed a higher level of ache activity than adult with females being considerably more active than the secretory enzyme from microfilariae preferentially utilized acetylthiocholine iodide as substrate and showed two electrophoretically distinct isoforms in native secretory enzyme was purified from the excretory/secretory products of microfilariae using edrophonium chloride linked to epoxy-activated analysis of purified acetylcholinesterase by sds-page revealed the existence of two proteins of 75kd and 45kd under nonreducing these secretory enzymes are antigenic and cross-reactive with wuchereria bancrofti-infected asymptomatic microfilaraemic human sera when tested by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and the secretory ache(s) from cervi microfilariae may be utilized for diagnosis of early filarial
augmentation of th1 and th2 effector cd4 responses by il-1 and the role of antigen-presenting cell (apc)-derived cytokines in t cell activation is still highly purified cd4 t cell populations of the naive and short-term th1 and th2 effector subsets were stimulation from anti-cd3 in the absence of apc was used to analyze directly t occurring cell-mediated and the requirement for co-signaling was addressed using exogenous il-1 and tnf each enhanced proliferation and il-2 secretion from naive although il-6 was most active in this peak were obtained with il-1 or tnf in combination with il-6 resulting in up to 11-fold increases in il-2 enhanced naive t cell responses were only observed with anti-cd3 and suggesting that co-signaling through surface-bound receptors was required to initiate il-2 although the cytokines enhanced naive little effect was seen on differentiation into effector il-6 or in partially suppressed effectors secreting but did not promote generation of effectors secreting in contrast to reports on cloned cell tnf and il-1 had enhancing activities on all cytokines elicited from already generated th1 and th2 effector again combinations of tnf and il-1 were most effective and generally required cd28 induced responses with preexisting effector cells were far less than with naive cells and predominantly directed at augmenting ifn-gamma and il-5 secretion rather than il-2 and these studies show that apc-derived cytokines can promote t cell responses directly but largely after co-stimulation from accessory molecule that the effect is not specific for one t cell subset or and that the naive t cell is the main target of
ovine brain natriuretic peptide in cardiac tissues and effects of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure on tissue concentration and molecular whereas numerous studies have examined the cardiac tissue content and secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide the response of brain natriuretic peptide (bnp) in states of experimental cardiac overload is less well our recent partial cloning of the ovine bnp gene has enabled us to study changes in cardiac tissue together with tissue and circulating molecular forms of anp and in response to cardiac overload induced by rapid ventricular pacing (n = 7) and aortic coarctation (n = in normal although highest levels of bnp were found in atrial tissue (15-fold those of the the bnp/anp concentration ratio in the ventricles was 10- to 20-fold higher than the ratio calculated for atrial compared with normal significant depletion of both anp and bnp concentrations within the left ventricle occurred after rapid ventricular size exclusion and reverse phase hplc analysis of atrial and ventricular tissue extracts from normal and overloaded sheep showed a single peak of high molecular weight bnp consistent with the probnp in immunoreactive bnp extracted from plasma drawn from the coronary sinus was all low molecular weight further analysis of plasma bnp using ion exchange hplc disclosed at least 3 distinct immunoreactive peaks consistent with ovine bnp forms 26-29 amino acid residues in these findings show that bnp is stored as the prohormone in sheep cardiac tissues and that complete processing to mature forms occurs at the time of the capacity to process the prohormone at secretion is not impaired by chronic heart
intracellular transport and secretion of salivary intracellular transport and secretion of salivary proteins are major activities of salivary acinar while the major intracellular pathway followed by salivary proteins following their synthesis has been described there is only limited understanding of how this process is regulated at the molecular studies of salivary especially proline-rich expressed in an endocrine cell line have begun to provide insight regarding intermolecular interactions during transport and the role played by structural signals during intracellular analysis of the secretion of newly synthesized salivary proteins in parotid tissue has shown that there are multiple pathways of discharge from acinar while granule exocytosis is the major at least two other pathways that export salivary proteins have been found to originate from maturing secretion these pathways may contribute to other acinar cell including secretion of proteins in the absence of acute stimulation and support of the secretory process for fluid and
an antigen valence theory to explain the evolution and organization of the humoral immune the three modes of antibody t independent (ti) and t dependent (td) are conserved among vertebrate species suggesting an important role for each in protection against i use an artificial to argue that the three modes of antibody production represent layers that evolved to deal optimally with antigens of different the apparently more sophisticated td response has not superseded the natural and ti components of the humoral immune the characteristic differences in somatic mutation and memory displayed by each antibody layer are appropriate for their targeted range of surface it is also suggested that the td and ti activation arms are at the extremes of a with signal integration of antigen and t cell-derived signals contributing to b cell decisions about isotype proliferation and secretion that minimize the time to
a phogrin-aequorin chimaera to image free ca2+ in the vicinity of secretory microdomains of high ca2+ concentration ([ca2+]) may be critical to the control of intracellular processes such as secretion and metabolism without compromising other cell to explore changes in [ca2+] in the outer mantle (< 30 nm deep) that surrounds the surface of dense-core secretory we have designed a recombinant chimaera between the granule protein phogrin and when expressed in populations of insulin-secreting min6 or phaeochromocytoma pc12 the chimaera was targeted to secretory granules as the recombinant protein reported a similar [ca2+] at the granule surface to that in the bulk measured with untargeted this was the case both at rest (-ca2+- = 80-120 nm) and after stimulation with agents that provoke ca2+ entry or ca2+ mobilization from intracellular and during activated thus depolarization of min6 cell populations with high k+ increased [ca2+] both in the bulk cytosol and close to the granules to 4 with near-identical kinetics of increase and stimulation of pc12 cells with atp provoked an increase in -ca2+- in either domain to these data argue in min6 and pc12 neuroendocrine cells (i) significant mobilization of ca2+ from most secretory granules probably does not occur during activated ca2+ influx or mobilization of internal ca2+ and (ii) agonist-stimulated ca2+-dependent secretion can occur without development of a large gradient of [ca2+] between the surface of most secretory vesicles and the rest of the
gonadotropin secretion and development of ovarian follicles during oestrous cycles in heifers treated with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone the hypothesis tested was that reduced lhrh stimulation of the anterior pituitary would lead to attenuated development of ovarian follicles as a result of reduced gonadotropin secretion during oestrous cycles of twenty heifers were randomly assigned to be treated ( n = 5/treatment) with an antagonist to lhrh (lhrh-ant) 1) from day 2 to 7 (day 0 = behavioural 2) day 7 to 3) day 12 to 4) or serve as untreated control lhrh-ant suppressed lh pulses of heifers in all treatment groups from treatment initiation through day 17 as compared with untreated control heifers [peters et luteinizing hormone has a role in development of fully functional corpora lutea (cl) but is not required to maintain cl function in 51 (1994) circulating concentration of fsh from day 8 to 10 of the oestrous cycle did not increase in heifers treated with lhrh-ant from day 2 to 7 or day 7 to there was increased (p < fsh from day 8 to 10 of the oestrous cycle in heifers treated with lhrh-ant from day 12 to 17 and control compared with control heifers treated with lhrh-ant from the day 2 to 7 had suppressed (p < size and persistence of the first and second dominant ovarian heifers treated with lhrh-ant from day 7 to 12 had suppressed size (p < and tended (p < to have a shorter persistence of the second dominant ovarian follicle compared with control heifers treated with lhrh-ant from day 12 to 17 had a similar (p > size and persistence of dominant ovarian follicles but had reduced (p < numbers of large follicles compared with control heifers treated with lhrh-ant from day 2 to 7 had lower (p < concentrations of 17 beta-oestradiol during the treatment period and tended (p < to have lower concentrations of 17 beta-oestradiol from day 7 to 12 of the oestrous cycle compared with control heifers treated with lhrh-ant from day 7 to 12 or day 12 to 17 had similar (p > circulating lh concentrations of l7 beta-oestradiol compared with control reduced lhrh stimulation of the pituitary from day 2 to 12 of the oestrous cycle and the resulting modulation in circulating lh and fsh led to suppressed ovarian follicular development and oestradiol after day 12 of the oestrous reduced lhrh stimulation of the anterior pituitary did not lead to altered ovarian follicular development to the extent as reduced lhrh stimulation before day 12 although pulsatile release of lh was similarly suppressed by treatment with the
testosterone pharmacokinetics after application of an investigational transdermal system in hypogonadal this placebo three-treatment crossover study in 19 hypogonadal men (27-82 years of age) evaluated dose proportionality of serum testosterone concentrations with application of one or two investigational transdermal testosterone systems for application to the arm or testosterone in vivo kinetics profiles were determined using a recently developed numerical deconvolution method that estimates drug absorption at different time intervals and/or drug disposition model after application of the investigational transdermal the mean serum and free testosterone concentrations were elevated to normal treatment allowed approximation of the normal circadian pattern of endogenous testosterone and the increase in serum testosterone concentrations was proportional to the surface area of systems the investigational transdermal system provided effective testosterone replacement therapy as judged by pharmacokinetic
endometrial responsiveness to oxytocin during diestrus and early pregnancy in pigs is not controlled solely by changes in oxytocin receptor population these studies were performed to test the hypotheses 1) endometrial responsiveness to oxytocin (ot) in pig endometrium is associated with changes in ot receptor (otr) population density resulting from corresponding regulation of otr gene 2) endometrial responsiveness to ot is controlled solely through a mechanism involving changes in otr population and 3) otr population density and endometrial responsiveness to ot differ between diestrus and early pregnancy in in experiment otr population density and dissociation constant (kd) in cyclic pigs were constant on days 10-16 but increased (p < between days 10 and 12 of pregnancy before decreasing (p < through day ot induced phosphoinositide (pi) hydrolysis and prostaglandin (pg) f2 alpha secretion in cyclic pigs only on day 16 (p < and during pregnancy only on day 12 (p < activation of g protein by aluminum fluoride (aif4-) treatment maximally stimulated (p < pi hydrolysis and pgf2 alpha secretion in cyclic pigs on all indicating that downstream from the the pgf2 alpha secretory pathway was fully during pi hydrolysis and pgf2 alpha secretion in response to aif4- decreased (p < on days 14 compared to days 10 and and aif4- did not stimulate pgf2 alpha release on day in experiment abundance of otr mrna in cyclic pigs decreased between days 0 and 5 before increasing between days 5 and 12 (p < but it was higher (p < on days 10-15 of pregnancy than on equivalent days in cyclic these results indicate that control of pgf2 alpha secretion in cyclic pigs appeared to occur primarily at the level of otr coupling to g protein because changes in otr number were not associated with increased sensitivity to ot or g-protein activation by during control was exerted at multiple which included the g phospholipase and subsequent aspects of the secretory the present study also indicated that endometrium was responsive to ot during luteolysis in cyclic pigs but not during corpus luteum maintenance in pregnant
increased expression of the secretory na+-k+-2cl- cotransporter with differentiation of a human intestinal cell we studied the expression of the secretory na(+)-k(+)- 2cl- cotransporter during epithelial differentiation using the clonal human adenocarcinoma cell line differentiation of ht29-18 cells was accompanied by up to 7-fold increases in cotransporter protein approximately 3-fold increases in cotransporter mrna and approximately increases in cotransporter functional no apparent change in cotransporter mrna stability was observed with suggesting that these effects may be due to differences in mrna transcription confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that undifferentiated cells grew in multilayers and exhibited a apparently unlocalized membrane labeling by anti-na(+)-k(+)-2cl- cotransporter in differentiated cells grew in monolayers with strong cotransporter labeling localized to the basal and lateral taken together with previous studies demonstrating that expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator is also increased following ht29-18 cell our results suggest that these cells provide a promising model for studying epithelial differentiation to a cl- secretory
bradykinin-induced responses in a coaxial bioassay system composed of rat anococcygeus muscle and guinea pig epithelium-dependent effects of bradykinin (bk) were investigated in a coaxial bioassay system which consisted of guinea pig trachea as donor organ and rat anococcygeus muscle as test bk (10(-9) to 10(-5) m) produced concentration-dependent relaxations on the phenylephrine (3 x 10(-6) m)-precontracted rat anococcygeus muscle mounted relaxations decreased significantly when muscle was mounted in epithelium-intact there was also a significant difference between the relaxations obtained in the muscle within epithelium-intact and epithelium-denuded trachea (at 10(-7) to 10(-5) m capsaicin (10(-5) m) pretreatment did not change bk (10(-9) to 10(-5) m)-induced relaxations in each preparation compared with vehicle indomethacin (10(-6) m) in combination with thiorphan (10(-5) m) and atropine (10(-6) m) did not affect the bk-induced relaxations of the muscle within capsaicin-pretreated epithelium-intact or denuded cgs 8515 (a specific 5-lipoxygenase 10(-6) m) did not change bk (10(-5) m)-induced relaxation on the muscle and caused an increase of bk-induced relaxation on the muscle within epithelium-intact trachea compared with that obtained without cgs results showed that epithelial or nonepithelial factors were capable of modulating the responsiveness of rat anococcygeus muscle to the decreased relaxation by bk in anococcygeus muscle did not occur by the release of cyclooxygenase products or tachykinins from tracheal but it may have occurred by the contractile action of lipoxygenase product secreted by nonepithelial in bk might stimulate the secretion of an epithelium-derived inhibitory factor from the
parafusin is a membrane and vesicle associated protein that cycles at in the unicellular eukaryote paramecium stimulation of exocytosis leads to ca2+ activation of an alpha glc-1-phosphodiesterase that dephosphoglucosylates the phosphoglycoprotein parafusin this process fails in exo mutant nd9 and also in the absence of ca2+ influx upon stimulation suggesting that pfus dephosphoglucosylation may be causally related to to further corroborate the hypothesis that pfus is involved in the molecular events in we used laser confocal scanning microscopy and a pfus specific peptide antibody to perform localization studies of pfus in wild type (wt) and mutant in unstimulated wt pfus was associated both with the exocytic site of the cell membrane and with the membrane of the dense core secretory localization at these two sites was shown to be independent of each other since the exocytosis mutant (exo-) in which docking of its vesicles is still showed cell membrane immunofluorescence and immunoblotting of isolated intact secretory vesicles also revealed pfus upon stimulation of pfus dissociated from both the dense core secretory vesicles and the cell membrane in a ca(2+)-dependent during recovery of exocytic pfus reassociated with the newly formed secretory vesicles in the cytoplasm prior to their docking at the exocytic immunoblot analysis of pfus during this time showed no changes in levels of the stimulation of exocytosis in wt in mg2+ buffer or in the exo- temperature sensitive mutant (nd9) at the non-permissive temperature did not lead to dissociation of the we conclude that pfus is a novel critical component whose cycling probably participates in the molecular exocytic fusion machinery in these
influence of feed restriction during lactation on gonadotropic hormones and ovarian development in primiparous effects of nutritional deficit during lactation on secretion of gonadotropic hormones and ovarian follicular populations around weaning were investigated in 24 primiparous crossbred sows were allocated to receive close to ad libitum intakes (h) or approximately 50% of this amount (l) during a 28-d serial blood samples were collected 1 d before weaning in the hours following weaning and 1 d after their ovaries were removed on the day of weaning or 2 d later (w+2) and subjected to macroscopic and histological mean and basal lh concentrations were not influenced by the level of frequency of lh pulses was reduced in l sows and vs and pulses/6 h at d and w+1 p < mean and basal concentrations of lh were influenced by the day of being significantly increased within hours following mean fsh concentrations were influenced neither by the level of feeding nor by the day of at the ovaries from l sows were lighter and had smaller follicles and fewer follicles > or = 4 mm (p < values of these macroscopic characteristics increased after weaning ( p < at the percentage of healthy follicles was higher in the first class (< 1 mm) and lower in the second class (1 to mm) in l compared to h sows (p < whatever the day of igf-i concentrations in follicular fluid tended to be lower in l than in h these results indicate that feed restriction during lactation inhibits lh pulsatility and ovarian
interferon gamma induces differential upregulation of alpha and beta chemokine secretion in colonic epithelial cell production of chemoattractant factors by the intestinal epithelium may contribute to mucosal infiltration by inflammatory cells in inflammatory bowel secretion of the alpha chemokine interleukin 8 a neutrophil has been widely but little is known about epithelial secretion of beta which are preferentially involved in recruiting to investigate the profiles of alpha and beta chemokine secretion in colonic cell lines and their differential modulation by interferon gamma a product of activated t lymphocytes and natural killer methods and a model of the ct secretory crypt exhibited a parallel secretion of the alpha chemokines il-8 and gro which could be markedly upregulated by tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and il-1 these cells showed no significant expression of the beta chemokines rantes (regulated upon activation t cell expressed and mip-1 alpha (macrophage inflammatory protein 1 and mcp-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein 1) under these but ifn-gamma in combination with tnf-alpha caused a dose dependent induction of rantes and mcp-1 this was accompanied by a marked increase of rantes in ifn-gamma had no significant effect on tnf-alpha stimulated il-8 caco-2 with features more typical of villus absorptive were relatively poor secretors of alpha chemokines but secreted high levels of mcp-1 in response to il-1 ifn-gamma did not influence alpha or beta chemokine secretion in these these studies suggest that intestinal epithelial cells may produce chemokines capable of attracting both neutrophils and the ability of ifn-gamma to activate the expression of beta chemokines preferentially could facilitate the development of chronic inflammatory
retinoid receptors expression in human term involvement of rxr alpha in retinoid induced-hcg to investigate the role of retinoids on human placental development and we characterized the spatial distribution of retinoid receptors in human term chorionic in situ hybridization with 35s labeled sense and antisense probes for the gamma and specifically detected only rar alpha and rxr both rar alpha and rxr alpha mrna were preferentially expressed in the trophoblast cell this syncytiotrophoblast expression was confirmed by immunohistochemical analyses using anti-rar alpha and rxr alpha using trophoblast cells in we then studied the effect on hcg secretion of microm ra physiological forms and of selective rar alpha and rxr alpha synthetic only rxr alpha specific ligands such as physiological 9-cis ra and synthetic ro 25-7386 stimulated hcg secretion these results suggest an important role for rxr alpha in human placental development and
relaxin inhibits the pulsatile release of oxytocin but increases basal concentrations of hormone in lactating the effects of porcine relaxin were examined in lactating rats to clarify the actions of relaxin on basal levels and the pulsatile release of oxytocin during baseline plasma oxytocin concentrations were pm in unsuckled they were significantly increased in rats after the onset of suckling pm) compared with unsuckled oxytocin concentrations were increased further during reflex milk ejection treatment with porcine relaxin (5 microg in ml saline) caused a significant (p < increase in plasma oxytocin compared with pretreatment concentrations or saline injection in all three frequent blood samples were taken before and during milk ejection to confirm pulsatile oxytocin associated with reflex milk short-lived (5-10-sec) pulses with peak concentrations of oxytocin pm were observed shortly before or at the time of the peak rise in intramammary pressure associated with reflex milk relaxin (5 microg completely suppressed the pulsatile release of these data suggest that relaxin increases basal secretion of oxytocin but inhibits the pulsatile secretion associated with reflex milk
experimental studies on the bacterial product cantastim derived from pseudomonas suppression of lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor are the lipid components we previously reported that the bacterial immunomodulator cantastim inhibited the lps-induced tnf-alpha production in murine macrophages both in vivo and in in this we compared the activity of cantastim with that of two phospholipids (cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine) which are among the components of its lipid we noticed a significant reduction in the production of tnf-alpha upon stimulation with lps in murine peritoneal macrophages pretreated for at least 3 h with cantastim or cantastim was active at much lower concentrations than preliminary experiments with partially deacylated cantastim indicated some decrease of tnf-alpha further studies are necessary to clarify this while cantastim and its partially deacylated derivative could trigger the tnf-alpha secretion in murine individual phospholipids did based on these we concluded that cantastim could induce the tnf-alpha suppression by multiple including the induction of regulatory cytokines such as il-10 and cd14 receptor
identification of two regions in apolipoprotein b100 that are exposed on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum protease protection assays of apolipoprotein b100 (apob) in digitonin-permeabilized hepg2 cells indicated that multiple domains of apob are exposed to the cytosol through an extensive portion of the secretory the intracellular orientation of apob in the secretory pathway was confirmed by immunocytochemistry using antibodies recognizing specific domains of apob in streptolysin-o (stp-o)- and saponin-permeabilized hepg2 lumenal epitopes on marker proteins in secretory pathway compartments and galactosyltransferase) were not stained by antibodies in stp-o-treated but were brightly stained in saponin-treated confirming that internal membranes were not perforated in stp-o-treated an anti-apob peptide antibody (b4) recognizing amino acids 3221-3240 caused intense staining in close proximity to the nuclear and less intensely throughout the secretory pathway in stp-o-permeabilized staining with this antibody was similar in stp-o- and saponin-treated indicating that this epitope in apob is exposed to the cytosol at the site of apob synthesis and throughout most of the remaining secretory similar results indicating a cytosolic orientation were obtained with monoclonal antibody which recognizes amino acids 690-797 (79-91 kd) in two polyclonal antibodies made to human ldl and two monoclonal antibodies recognizing amino acids 1878-2148 and 3214-3506 (b1b6) in apob did not produce a strong reticular signal for apob in stp-o-treated the anti-ldl and b1b6 antibodies produced almost identical punctate patterns in stp-o-treated cells that overlapped with a membrane marker for these observations suggest that the b1b6 epitope of apob is exposed on the surface of the the results identify two specific regions in apob that are exposed to the cytosol in the secretory
enhancement of type iv collagenases by highly metastatic variants of ht1080 fibrosarcoma cells established by a transendothelial invasion system in a novel in vitro invasion assay system was established in this in which the invasion of tumor cells after interaction with endothelial cells could be two variant cell lines fp-21) were established from parental ht1080 cells using this assay fp-10 and fp-21 cells had higher invasive and metastatic potential than the parental cells both in vitro and in the activity of anchorage-independent proliferation and the adhesion to the huvec monolayer of fp-10 and fp-21 was greater than the parental the secretion of type iv collagenase (both mmp-2 and mmp-9) was also increased more significantly by the variant cells than by the parental and the expression of upa mrna was higher in fp-10 and treatment of variant cells with human timp-2 remarkably suppressed the increment of the in vitro invasion to the same level as parental these results suggest that this in vitro transendothelial invasion system accelerates multiple mechanisms of the metastasis by especially the production of type iv it can thus provide a useful model of tumor
expression and secretion of beta-galactosidase in saccharomyces cerevisiae using the signal sequences of the major yeast glycosylphosphatidylinositol-containing new secretory signals and strategies can be attempted to improve the secretion of heterologous proteins of biotechnological interest which encounter difficulties being exported in the ggpi gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae codes for a 125 kda glycoprotein transported through the secretory pathway and anchored to the plasma membrane by means of a the regions coding for the secretory signal or also for the first 46 amino acids were tested for efficiency in secretion by fusion to the lacz gene of escherichia coli resulting in the synthesis of the endoplasmic reticulum-targeted 1-22- and 1-68-ggpip/beta-gal a cytoplasmic form was also the 1-22 beta gal is partially transported to the cell surface and in the medium in an unglycosylated the 1-68 beta gal is completely retained in the intracellular membranes and is n-glycosylated in the ggpip the amount of hybrid protein produced is similar and independent from its targeted suggesting that translocation through endoplasmic reticulum is not a limiting whereas the amount of active enzyme is from 50 to 80% lower for the endoplasmic reticulum forms compared with the cytoplasmic bip/kar2p putative precursor is accumulated in cells expressing the endoplasmic reticulum-targeted forms but not in those producing the cytosolic beta-galactosidase or over-expressing an endogenous secretory glycosylation and abnormal folding rather than over-expression are among the factors responsible for the decreased activity and exit of beta-galactosidase from the endoplasmic reticulum and for induction of the results obtained indicate that the sole secretory signal of ggpip is suitable to drive secretion of foreign products with complex folding and point to the importance of the endoplasmic reticulum quality control in the secretion of heterologous proteins in
inter-regulated balance between gelatinases and tissue inhibitor (timp-1) in isolated human leukocyte infiltration inside glomeruli necessitates basement membrane collagen breakdown and leads to cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis during the repair process as observed in the course of acute vasculitis and acute graft two matrix mmp-2 and mmp-9 are expressed and co-secreted in balance with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (timp-1) by activated neutrophils as well as by glomerular cells and are aimed to control basement membrane collage using a conventional double mesh sieving pure populations of glomeruli were isolated from fresh human cortex specimen and maintained in short-term zymography and immunoblotting of conditioned serum-free media revealed glomerular mmp-9 and timp-1 secretion and activity while reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification of cellular rna demonstrated glomerular transcripts coding for these enzymes and their when purified neutrophils were allowed to adhere onto transwell apparatus in contact with glomerular neutrophil 92 kda gelatinase seemed apparently inhibited mainly because the production of timp-1 was enhanced on both sides of the glomerular 72 kda and 92 kda gelatinases were activated shortly (1 to 6 h) after neutrophils had interacted with glomeruli and furthermore upon activation by inflammatory or vasoactive mediators such as decreased neutrophil mmp-9 activity together with reduced mmp-9 mrna levels and protracted timp-1 transcription and secretion during cell-cell interaction could participate to cell detachment from degraded basement membranes and to increased collagen deposition leading to glomerulosclerosis after initial glomerular injury by inflammatory

pkc isoforms and other signaling proteins involved in surfactant secretion in developing rat type ii we previously reported that there is a developmental increase in surfactant secretion in response to p2y2 purinoceptor utp does not stimulate secretion in type ii cells from 1- or 2-day-old there is a small response to utp in cells from 4-day-old and the response increases with increasing age second messenger formation in response to p2y2 agonists has a similar developmental we have investigated whether the failure to respond to p2y2 agonists is due to a deficiency in the p2y2 receptor or in downstream signaling we compared type ii cells from adult and 1- to 2-day-old rats with respect to expression of the p2y2 receptor gene and the levels of phospholipase c-beta (plc-beta) and protein kinase c (pkc) isomers and of the alpha-subunit of the gtp-binding protein we measured gene expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and protein levels by we identified and and gqalpha in adult and newborn type ii and -lambda and and -beta4 were not present in adult or newborn type ii expression of the p2y2 receptor gene was essentially the same in newborn and adult the levels of and -zeta in newborn type ii cells were only 43-57% those of adult the level of pkc-theta also tended to be lower in the newborn there was little difference between newborn and adult type ii cells in the levels of and and these data suggest that the lack of response of early newborn type ii cells to p2y2 agonists is not due to a lack of expression of the receptor gene but possibly to insufficient amounts of one or more of the or zeta pkc
galanin inhibits glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion through pertussis toxin-sensitive g protein and atp-dependent potassium channels in rat ileal the neuropeptide galanin is widely distributed in the gastrointestinal tract and exerts several inhibitory especially on intestinal motility and on insulin release from pancreatic the presence of galanin fibres not only in the myenteric and submucosal plexus but also in the prompted us to investigate the regulatory role of and its mechanism of on the secretion of the insulinotropic hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 rat ileal cells were dispersed through mechanical vibration followed by moderate exposure to dnase i and and enriched for l-cells by counterflow a 6- to 7-fold enrichment in glp-1 cell content was registered after as compared with the crude cell preparation (929 +/- 81 vs 138 +/- 14 fmol/10(6) l-cells then accounted for 4-5% of the total cell bombesin induced a time-(15-240 min) and dose- nm-1 microm) dependent release of glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide 100 forskolin (10 microm) and the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate 1 microm) each stimulated glp-1 secretion over a 1-h incubation galanin nm) induced a dose-dependent inhibition of bombesin- and of gip-stimulated glp-1 release (mean inhibition of 90% with 100 nm galanin also dose-dependently inhibited forskolin-induced glp-1 secretion (74% of inhibition with 100 nm but not tpa-stimulated hormone pretreatment of cells with 200 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 3 or incubation with the atp-sensitive k+ channel blocker disopyramide (200 prevented the inhibition by galanin of bombesin- and gip-stimulated glp-1 these studies indicate that intestinal secretion of glp-1 is negatively controlled by that acts through receptors coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive g protein and involves atp-dependent k+
growth hormone- and testosterone-dependent regulation of glutathione transferase subunit a5 in rat the class alpha glutathione s-transferase (gst) subunit a5 is expressed in the livers of young male and female after sexual this protein is no longer detectable in the livers of male but is still expressed in female we have previously demonstrated that the sexually dimorphic secretion of growth hormone regulates the levels of certain class mu gsts in rat and this study was designed to investigate the hormonal regulation of control and hypophysectomized rats of both sexes were used to study the role of growth hormone in the regulation of hepatic and the influence of testosterone on the expression of this same subunit was investigated in intact females and castrated liver cytosols were subjected to sds/page and immunoblotting using antibodies directed towards rat and to affinity purification on glutathione-sepharose followed by reverse-phase hplc in order to quantify the relative levels of m1 and m2 these analyses revealed that the expression of rgsta5 regulated by both growth hormone and
the caulobacter crescentus paracrystalline s-layer protein is secreted by an abc transporter (type i) secretion caulobacter crescentus is a gram-negative bacterium that produces a two-dimensional crystalline array on its surface composed of a single 98-kda secretion of rsaa to the cell surface relies on an uncleaved c-terminal secretion in this we identify two genes encoding components of the rsaa secretion these components are part of a type i secretion system involving an abc transporter these lying immediately of were found by screening a tn5 transposon library for the loss of rsaa transport and characterizing the transposon-interrupted the two proteins presumably encoded by these genes were found to have significant sequence similarity to abc transporter and membrane fusion proteins of other type i secretion the greatest sequence similarity was found to the alkaline protease (apra) transport system of pseudomonas aeruginosa and the metalloprotease (prtb) transport system of erwinia the prtb and apra genes were introduced into and their products were secreted by the rsaa transport defects in the s-layer protein transport system led to the loss of this heterologous this is the first report of an s-layer protein secreted by a type i secretion unlike other type i secretion the rsaa transport system secretes large amounts of its substrate protein (it is estimated that rsaa accounts for 10 to 12% of the total cell such levels are expected for bacterial s-layer proteins but are higher than for any other known type i secretion
lysophosphatidyl a chemotactic factor for monocytes/t-lymphocytes is elevated in inflammatory processes have been hypothesized to mediate some of the clinical sequelae associated with the peritoneal fluid (pf) of women with endometriosis is known to contain more inflammatory cells and their associated and growth this work provides strong evidence for oxidative stress in the pf of women with 1) the low density lipoprotein (ldl) isolated from the pf of subjects with endometriosis shows a small but detectable increase in electrophoretic mobility compatible with mildly oxidized ldl compared with ldl isolated from the plasma of the same subjects and pf of 2) isolated pf-ldl of endometriosis subjects is more readily oxidized in vitro than pf-ldl of or ldl isolated from 3) vitamin e content is significantly lower in endometriosis pf compared with and compared with plasma of women with endometriosis and no difference is seen between plasma and pf of control 4) the ratio of phosphatidylcholine/lyso phosphatidylcholine (ptd/lyso ptdcho) in the pf of endometriosis subjects is significantly lower compared with pf of taken these data provide strong evidence for a pro-oxidant environment in the peritoneal cavity of women with lyso a product derived from phospholipase a2 action on peroxidized phosphatidylcholine and a potent chemotactic factor for monocytes and is elevated in we hypothesize that the increased presence of lipid peroxidation products in the pf of endometriosis subjects at least account for the recruitment of the increase in macrophage the secretion of monocyte--macrophage-derived and the endometrial growth-promoting activity associated with
presenilin-1 mutations associated with familial disease do not disrupt protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi mutations in genes encoding presenilin-1 (ps1) and presenilin-2 (ps2) have been linked to familial forms of disease cells expressing mutant presenilins produce elevated levels of the major amyloid peptide found in ad the mechanism whereby this occurs remains but the localization of presenilins to endoplasmic reticulum (er) and golgi compartments has suggested that they may function in intracellular trafficking pathways involved in processing beta-amyloid precursor proteins to test this we coexpressed or ps1(l286v) in hek293 cells together with the ldl a classic glycoprotein marker that undergoes post-translational o-glycosylation in the golgi pulse-chase analysis of the receptor indicated that mutant presenilins had no effect on er-->golgi similar results were obtained when the studies were carried out with cells expressing the swedish variant of app (swapp751) instead of the ldl secretion of the soluble exodomain polypeptide fragments of swapp751 that arise from alpha-secretase and beta-secretase cleavage was not markedly affected by the ps1 despite the lack of discernible effect of the ps1 mutants on trafficking of proteins through the golgi they caused a substantial increase in the proportion of abeta42 relative to total abeta in the culture the results suggest that mutant forms of ps1 cause elevated production of abeta42 by a mechanism that is independent of a major disruption of exocytic trafficking of
interleukin-1beta regulates pituitary follistatin and inhibin/activin betab mrna levels and attenuates fsh secretion in response to activins and follistatins regulate all levels of the reproductive including the pituitary where they stimulate and inhibit fsh gonadotropes are known to express inhibin/activin betab and activin-b (betabbetab) functions as an autocrine modulator of fsh by the mrna for the activin-binding is present in most pituitary cells and folliculo-stellate cells may be the major source of the protein secreted by the anterior interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) is one of several cytokines known to also influence the reproductive il-1beta inhibits the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (hpg) axis by suppressing gnrh and gonadal steroid because several pituitary cell including follistatin-producing folliculo-stellate are targets of cytokine effects on gonadotrope function were evaluated using cultured rat anterior pituitary activin-a to 1 24h) increased basal fsh secretion approximately il-1beta to nm) by itself had no effect on basal fsh il-1beta attenuated fsh secretion in response to all concentrations of these results suggest that the cytokine might stimulate the local production of a such as that antagonizes the action of rnase protection analysis indicated that il-1beta to 5 nm) stimulated follistatin and inhibin/activin betab mrna accumulation in a time-dependent these in vitro effects of il-1beta were blocked by the specific il-1 receptor antagonist (il-lra) and were not mimicked by either rhil-6 or lipopolysaccharide treatment of intact male rats with lps (50 which increases plasma il-1beta and induces il-1beta expression in many including the produced similar time-dependent increases in pituitary follistatin and inhibin/activin subunit mrna these results suggest that il-1beta can modulate gonadotrope responses to activins by influencing the local balance of activin-b and follistatin within the
induction of primary immune responses by allogeneic human dissection of the cell types required for ifngamma secretion and non-professional antigen-presenting cells (apc) have a limited ability to activate t lymphocytes during normal and auto-immune myoblasts could play an important role as apc in the etiology of autoimmune myasthenia gravis and as well as during muscle graft we examined the role of different component cell subsets in the response of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) to allogeneic treatment of myoblasts with tnfalpha or ifngamma led to the expression of a range of immunostimulatory molecules including mhc class i and and cd95 but not b7 family whole cultured with allogeneic secreted and were proliferation and ifngamma secretion were largely dependent on the presence of cd4+ but neither cd4+ nor cd8+ t cells were responsible for which was mediated by mhc class ii+ non-t mononuclear purified cd4+ lymphocytes co-cultured with allogeneic myoblasts required co-stimulation with anti-cd28 antibodies for proliferation and ifngamma which only induced a low level of ifngamma secretion by cd8+ lymphocytes and did not induce cytotoxic these results suggest that human myoblasts can act as antigen-presenting cells for naive t but only with additional
handling of doxorubicin by the llc-pk1 kidney epithelial cell the characteristics of doxorubicin handling have been studied in the cultured kidney epithelial cell line which has structure and function similar to those of renal tubular cells and expresses the uptake of doxorubicin by llc-pk1 cells was time reaching a steady state at about 4 and reduced at low the initial uptake was the efflux of doxorubicin from llc-pk1 cells was also temperature dependent even at 37 degrees a significant percentage of the drug remained associated with the cells after 180 which suggests a strong cellular and the fluorescence microscopy revealed that the drug was concentrated in intracellular substances that are substrates for such as vincristine and significantly increased doxorubicin concentrations in llc-pk1 similar results were obtained with the metabolic inhibitors sodium metavanadate and on the other the uptake was not affected by the classic organic cation transport drugs decynium 22 or decynium nor by the organic anion drug these results indicate in llc-pk1 doxorubicin enters by passive is trapped in intracellular organelles and then is extruded from cells by a mechanism that probably involves on the substances that interfere with the renal organic cation or anion secretory system have no effect on doxorubicin net accumulation in these
potential use of cytokine therapy in newly hatched chickens are highly susceptible to infection during the first 2 weeks of the utilisation of cytokines as therapeutic agents in livestock in particular has become more feasible with the recent cloning of cytokine genes and the progression of new technologies such as live we have constructed a live recombinant fowlpox virus (fpv) that expresses chicken myelomonocytic growth factor administration of fp/cmgf to chicks resulted in a marked and sustained increase in the number of circulating blood monocytes as well as an increase in their state of as measured by enhanced phagocytic activity and elevated production of nitric we have recently cloned the gene for chicken interferon-gamma recombinant chifn-gamma was capable of protecting chick fibroblasts from undergoing virus-mediated lysis and induced nitrite secretion from chicken macrophages in preliminary vaccination trials have indicated that co-administration of chifn-gamma with antigen (sheep red blood cells) resulted in enhanced secondary (igg) antibody responses and allowed a 10-fold lower dose of antigen to be administration of chifn-gamma resulted in enhanced weight gain in chicks and improved their resistance to disease the ability of cytokines to combat infection and enhance vaccine efficacy makes them excellent candidates as a therapeutic agents and
a limited renal injury may cause a permanent form of neurogenic we have shown that an acute injury to the kidney produced by an intrarenal injection of phenol causes an immediate increase in blood pressure and in norepinephrine (ne) secretion from the posterior the studies suggest that in this model afferent impulses from the kidney to central integrative structures in the brain may be responsible for the increase in blood to further evaluate whether a renal injury caused by the intrarenal injection of phenol leads to a permanent elevation of blood pressure and whether this is mediated by increased sympathetic nervous system we examined the chronic effects (4 weeks) of an intrarenal injection of 50 microl of 10% phenol on blood pressure and ne secretion from the posterior systolic blood pressure increased from 128 +/- to 176 +/- mm hg (p < 4 weeks after receiving the intrarenal injection of but it did not change in rats that received the vehicle (128 +/- and 135 +/- mm hg) and in rats that were subjected to renal denervation (127 +/- and 124 +/- mm the secretion of ne from the posterior hypothalamic nuclei was greater (p < in rats that received phenol (253 +/- pg/ml) than in controls (158 +/- pg/ml) and denervated rats (170 +/- these studies have shown that a limited injury to one kidney may cause a permanent elevation of blood pressure and this is associated with increased sympathetic nervous system
[changes in systemic and local immunity in patients with acute and chronic purulent sinusitis in response to regional lymphotropic immunostimulating we studied the effects of regional lymphotropic immunostimulating therapy on alterations in immunoglobulins levels both in blood serum and paranasal sinuses mucosal secretion in patients with acute and chronic purulent solutions of lidase and novocain were administered into the area of the submaxillary lymph the effect was compared to that obtained after subcutaneous administration of tactivin and conventional no reliable alterations in systemic humoral immunity in response to lymphotropic immunostimulating therapy was reported in acute while in chronic sinusitis an increase in initially low iga regional lymphotropic administration of tactivin promoted a pronounced decrease in the initially elevated levels of iga and igg in the secretion of paranasal mucosa in acute purulent and an increase of basaline lowered a fall in the igg concentration in chronic purulent this is indicative of effectiveness of this method of immunostimulator administration on local immunological reactivity of the mucous

a novel organ culture method to study the function of human odontoblasts in gelatinase expression by odontoblasts is differentially regulated by odontoblasts cannot be cultured by traditional cell culture thus restricting in vitro here we present an organ culture method for human odonto-blasts that utilizes the pulp chamber as a culture crowns of human third molars were pulp was gently and the odontoblasts attached to and in the walls of the pulp chambers were cultured in serum-free opti-mem or f12 medium containing 10% pulp tissues were cultured cell content and morphology were analyzed by and the removed pulps were examined by light proteins secreted into the medium with or without tgf-beta1 supplementation were metabolically labeled with and the total protein content was assessed by tca precipitation and to assess the role of gelatinolytic enzymes on dentin matrix we used enzymography to analyze the effect of tgf-beta1 on gelatinase a and b sem revealed odontoblasts in pulp chambers after 5 days of with only few or no and no alterations in the odontoblast cell morphology or differences between the cells cultured in serum-free and serum-containing rarely were any odontoblasts present in pulp radiolabeling revealed protein synthesis and secretion until day 6 in both the odontoblast and pulp with no marked differences between tgf-beta1-treated and control the level of gelatinase a remained constant up to 7 while gelatinase b expression was always low and decreased with time in gelatinase b levels were markedly increased upon tgf-beta1 treatment of cells and remained high to day the results suggest that this method provides a novel technique for the study of human odontoblasts in vitro and that odontoblasts can be cultured even in serum-free
effect of chronic amylase inhibition on pancreatic growth and acinar cell secretory function in wheat amylase inhibitor (wai) was given to growing rats to determine whether chronic inhibition of intraluminal amylase activity alters pancreatic pancreatic enzyme and secretory responsiveness to cholecystokinin octapeptide (cck-op) and for 21 days 13 rats were fed amylase inhibitor (ai) as of the weight of their 13 were pair-fed controls and 12 were controls with free access to food amylase and lipase secretion was measured from isolated pancreatic acini in response to cck-op (10(-12)-10(-8) m) and carbachol (10(-8)-10(-3) ai and pfc rats had similar food intakes and weight pancreatic and contents of enzymes and but these measurements were significantly reduced compared to those of fac dna contents per milligram of pancreas and per gram of body weight and amylase/dna and trypsin/dna were similar among all lipase/dna and chymotrypsin/dna in ai rats were the same as in pfc rats but significantly lower than in fac in response to amylase secretion was similar in all three but in response to carbachol amylase secretion was significantly less in ai compared to pfc and fac lipase secretion increased in response to cck-op in ai compared to pfc and fac rats but was similar in all three groups in response to long-term inhibition of intraluminal amylase activity suppresses pancreatic growth and content of enzymes and rna by reducing food intake and weight gain and also decreases acinar cell secretion of amylase in response to carbachol and increases lipase secretion in response to
enhancement of long-term testosterone secretion and steroidogenic enzyme expression in human leydig cells by co-culture with human sertoli cell-enriched we have shown previously that long-term testosterone which decreases when human leydig cells are cultured increases when purified human leydig and sertoli cells are cultured in this human leydig cell functions were studied further during in vitro either alone or with human sertoli on a basal membrane derived from bovine corneal endothelial the secretion of testosterone increased during the first week of co-culture and remained elevated up to day 12 of in one prolonged testosterone secretion decreased progressively after day 12 after 1 month of was at a level similar to that observed during the first 48 after culture for 48 testosterone secretion in the co-culture was enhanced by 162 +/- 5% (p < compared with values observed when leydig cells were cultured alone +/- ng/10(6) leydig cells/48 mean +/- this change was associated with increase in mrna levels for 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase delta 5-delta 4-isomerase +/- cytochrome p450c17 +/- cytochrome p450scc +/- and cytochrome p450 aromatase +/- when leydig cells were co-cultured with sertoli cells (p < for each igf-i mrna levels were higher +/- for kb and +/- for kb transcripts) in the leydig-sertoli cell co-cultures than the sum of the levels in leydig and in sertoli cells cultured both basal and hcg-induced testosterone secretion were enhanced by treatment of the co-culture with human recombinant fsh (50 for basal testosterone this increase amounted to 163 +/- 5% compared with leydig cells cultured alone (p < and by 112 +/- 4% compared with non-fsh treated co-cultures (p < for hcg-stimulated testosterone secretion this increase was 220 +/- 12% compared with leydig cells cultured alone (p < and 132 +/- 8% compared with non-fsh treated co-cultures (p < this study confirms the enhancement of long-term testosterone secretion by adult human leydig cells by co-culture with adult human sertoli cells and shows that this effect is associated with an enhancement of the expression of several steroidogenic it might be as in other through increased production of igf-i by
human immune cells mediate catecholamine secretion from adrenal chromaffin to determine the ability of human mononuclear cells to produce factors that cause catecholamine secretion from adrenomedullary chromaffin to determine conditions that stimulate mononuclear cells to produce such and to compare these results with catecholamine secretion in response to the cytokines interleukin (il)-1 and prospective study using in vitro university research human mononuclear cells and porcine chromaffin circulating human mononuclear cells were isolated and cultured overnight in rpmi cell-free media from these cultures (conditioned media) were then tested for the ability to cause epinephrine secretion from porcine chromaffin mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin or by mixing cells from two different individuals while suppression was tested with catecholamine secretion in response to il-1 and il-2 (50 and 500 or nicotinic agonist dimethylphenylpiperazinium (10 which mimics the action of was tested for measurements and main isolated porcine chromaffin cells had stable catecholamine content at the time of secretion and catecholamine release from cells into the media was measured using electrochemical detection after high-performance liquid chromatography catecholamine secretion was expressed as a percentage of the total cellular epinephrine secretion due to human conditioned media was +/- compared with +/- for control media (p < and +/- for dimethylphenylpiperazinium (p < epinephrine secretion with conditioned media from mixed cells (mixed leukocyte reaction) was +/- which was higher than the epinephrine secretion caused by media from a single donor +/- p < pretreatment with dexamethasone inhibited the formation of bioactive products from mixed mononuclear cell cytokines il-1 and il-2 did not stimulate chromaffin cell epinephrine secretion above background release with control media in all norepinephrine secretion was similar to that of and results are included in all factors released from human immune cells can mediate epinephrine and norepinephrine release from adrenomedullary cells through a nonneural such immune cell factor release can be modulated by immunostimulation and steroid release of such factors in vivo may contribute to increased circulating epinephrine in response to infectious challenge and may be an important factor in the critically ill
inhibition of lpl expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages is dependent on ldl oxidation a key role for the regulation of macrophage lipoprotein lipase (lpl) secretion and mrna expression by atherogenic lipoproteins is of critical relevance to foam cell lpl is present in arterial lesions and constitutes a bridging ligand between and cell thus favoring macrophage lipoprotein uptake and lipid we investigated the effects of native and of oxidized lipoproteins on the expression of lpl in an in vitro human monocyte-macrophage exposure of mature macrophages (day 12) to highly copper-oxidized human low density lipoprotein (ldl) (100 microg protein per milliliter) led to marked reduction in the expression of lpl activity and mrna level native acetylated and ldl oxidized for <6 hours were without the reduction in lpl activity became significant at a threshold of 6 hours of ldl oxidation among the biologically active sterols formed during ldl only 7beta-hydroxycholesterol (5 microg/ml) induced a minor reduction in macrophage lpl whereas 25-hydroxycholesterol was without by whose ldl content increased in parallel with the degree of induced significant reductions in lpl activity and mrna levels at concentrations of 2 to 20 micromol/l (-34% to our results demonstrate that highly oxidized ldl (>6-hour oxidation) exerts negative feedback on lpl secretion in human monocytes-macrophages via a reduction in mrna by native ldl and mildly oxidized ldl (<6-hour oxidation) did not exert a feedback effect on lpl we speculate that the content of lysophosphatidylcholine to a lesser of 7beta-hydroxycholesterol in oxidized ldls is responsible for the downregulation of lpl activity and mrna abundance in human monocyte-derived macrophages and may therefore modulate lpl-mediated pathways of lipoprotein uptake during conversion of macrophages to foam
the time course of follicle-stimulating hormone suppression by recombinant human inhibin a in the adult male rhesus monkey (macaca in higher fsh secretion appears to be regulated by a control system consistent with that described by the classical inhibin the purpose of the present experiment was to examine the time course of action to suppress fsh secretion in the intact adult male rhesus to this five adult males implanted with indwelling venous catheters and exhibiting typical episodic patterns of lh and testosterone (t) secretion received a 4-day infusion of recombinant human (rh) inhibin a (832 ng/h x kg) after a 4-week by vehicle infusion of similar changes in circulating fsh concentrations during the inhibin and vehicle infusions were determined using a sensitive homologous macaque whereas enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were employed to track inhibin inhibin and inhibin pro-alpha-c levels during the normal pulsatile activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-leydig cell axis was confirmed by monitoring changes in circulating concentrations of lh and t in 12-h windows of sequential blood collection (1200-2400 every 20 min) and after the rh inhibin a and vehicle although infusion of rh inhibin which led to a 12 ng/ml square wave increment in circulating levels of this inhibin produced a marked decline in circulating fsh significant suppression of the secretion of this gonadotropin was not manifest until 54 h after initiation of the despite the marked decline in fsh secretion during the last 24 h of the 4-day infusion of recombinant circulating inhibin b and pro-alpha-c concentrations were maintained at preinfusion control levels (1 the finding that imposition of an exaggerated circulating inhibin signal led to suppression of fsh secretion in the male monkey only after 2 days of exposure to the hormone indicates that in this species the feedback action of testicular inhibin on fsh secretion is heavily as the decrease in fsh did not lead to changes in native inhibin it seems reasonable to propose that the fsh-inhibin feedback loop that governs testicular function in higher primates operates with considerable hysteresis at both the pituitary and gonadal the failure of dramatically elevated inhibin a levels to influence the pulsatile secretion of lh in the monkey reinforces the idea that in this species the pituitary action of testicular inhibin is specific for fsh and does not involve modulation of gnrh receptor
prostaglandin e2 in the salivary glands of the female amblyomma americanum calcium mobilization and a cholera prostaglandin e2 (pge2) specific receptor has been identified in the plasma membrane fraction of tick salivary in the present we report that stimulation of dispersed salivary glands of the lone star tick amblyomma americanum with 1 nm to 10 microm pge2 increased the intracellular concentration of inositol trisphosphate (ip3) in a dose-dependent incubation of dispersed tissue with 1 nm to 10 microm pge2 also stimulated release of 45ca2+ from preloaded pge2 (10 microm) did not stimulate an influx of the pge2 receptor in the salivary glands appears to activate a phosphoinositide phospholipase c signalling pathway to increase formation of intracellular ip3 mobilize ca2+ from intracellular incubation of dispersed salivary glands with 1 nm to 1 microm pge2 stimulated secretion of anticoagulant but not at < 1 nm or > 1 microm in the mammalian pge2 ep1 receptor antagonist ah-6809 affected secretion of anticoagulant by dispersed salivary gland tissue at a low concentration supporting the hypothesis that the pge2 receptor in tick salivary glands is we propose that a major function for pge2 in tick salivary glands is to mobilize ca2+ and stimulate secretion (exocytosis) of bioactive proteins into the saliva during
imidazoles suppress rat testosterone secretion and testicular interstitial fluid formation in the aim of these studies was to examine the effects of imidazoles on testosterone secretion and testicular interstitial fluid (tif) formation through measurement of serum serum tif and tif 4-methylimidazole and an oral imidazole antifungal caused dose-dependent decreases in testosterone secretion and tif and 4-mi decreased lh 4-mi decreased testosterone secretion 1-6 h after increased testosterone at 8-16 decreased lh secretion at 4 decreased tif volumes at 1-8 and slightly increased tif volumes at 24 4-mi blocked the stimulatory effects of hcg on testosterone secretion and prevented an expected increase in lh secretion after the 4-mi-induced decrease in testosterone 4-mi also reversed the effects of three other stimulants of testosterone secretion that presumably act through three different testicular regulatory an excitatory amino ng-nitro-l-arginine methyl a nitric oxide synthase and an opioid these results support the hypothesis that imidazoles inhibit testicular function and male reproductive function through inhibition of testosterone tif and lh secretion regulatory
absence of photoperiodic modulation of gonadotrophin secretion in hpd rams following chronic pulsatile infusion of hypothalamo-pituitary disconnected soay rams (hpd rams) were treated chronically with a pulsatile infusion of gnrh (250 ng/2 h) for 10 weeks to reactivate the pituitary-gonadal axis under long days ld group n=8) and short days sd group the aim was to establish whether photoperiod modulates the secretion of gonadotrophins (presumably through the daily melatonin signal) by an action at the level of the pituitary the treatment of the hpd rams with gnrh induced a long-term increase in the peripheral blood concentrations of lh and growth of the testes and reappearance of the androgen-dependent sexual skin there were parallel changes in the pulsatile fluctuations in the blood concentrations of lh and the pituitary responsiveness to gnrh and the testicular responsiveness to a standardized injection of as observed previously in normal intact rams during reactivation of the reproductive axis induced by a switch from long to short there were no significant differences in any of the reproductive parameters between the ld and sd hpd although the blood concentrations of prolactin were significantly higher in the ld and gnrh provoked a chronic increase in the blood concentrations of particularly in the sd the results support the conclusion that (i) melatonin does not act within the pituitary gland to mediate effects of photoperiod on gnrh-induced gonadotrophin and (ii) changes in prolactin secretion which result from the local action of melatonin in the pituitary gland do not affect gonadotrophin secretion in the
correlation between electrophysiological phenomena and transport of macromolecules in intestinal this review discuss some recent findings in the study of the regulation of the permeability of the intestinal epithelial comparison of electrical phenomena and transport of macromolecules suggests that secretory activity and increased transepithelial transport of macromolecules are related when secretion is mediated by the ca2+ and pkc dependent the transport of the macromolecules is via the transcellular and via the paracellular the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium may be diminished during nervous (acetylcholine)- and immuno-(histamine) mediated it is hypothesised that some bacterial toxins may also induce ca2+ and pkc dependent secretion and thereby can reduce the epithelial the camp and cgmp mediated which can be recognised by their long-lasting transepithelial potential are not coupled to increased transepithelial transport of some forms of secretory diarrhea may therefore be related to the development of food-allergy or
lysergic acid diethylamide (lsd) is a partial agonist of d2 dopaminergic receptors and it potentiates dopamine-mediated prolactin secretion in lactotrophs in the hallucinogenic effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (lsd) have mainly been attributed to the interaction of this drug with the serotoninergic but it seems more likely that they are the result of the complex interactions of the drug with both the serotoninergic and dopaminergic the aim of the present study was to investigate the functional actions of lsd at dopaminergic receptors using prolactin secretion by primary cultures of rat pituitary cells as a lsd produced a dose-dependent inhibition of prolactin secretion in vitro with an ic50 at this action was antagonized by spiperone but not by skf83566 or which indicates that lsd has a specific effect on d2 dopaminergic the maximum inhibition of prolactin secretion achieved by lsd was lower than that by dopamine (60% versus the fact that lsd at 10(-8)-10(-6) m antagonized the inhibitory effect of dopamine (10(-7) m) and bromocriptine (10(-11) m) suggests that lsd acts as a partial agonist at d2 receptors on lactotrophs in lsd at 10(-13)-10(-10) the concentrations which are 10-1000-fold lower than those required to induce direct inhibition on pituitary prolactin potentiated the dopamine m)-mediated prolactin secretion by pituitary cells in these results suggest that lsd not only interacts with dopaminergic receptors but also has a unique capacity for modulating dopaminergic these findings may offer new insights into the hallucinogenic effect of
human endothelial cell storage a novel intracellular site for isoforms of the endothelin-converting we have previously shown endothelin (et)-like immunoreactive staining in weibel-palade storage granules that are an integral component of the regulated secretory pathway in endothelial these structures degranulate after chemical or mechanical stimuli that result in cytosolic calcium we therefore investigated whether the regulated pathway might be an intracellular site involved in the cleavage of big et-1 to the biologically active peptide et-1 by determining the ultrastructural localization of endothelin-converting enzyme a low level of ece-like immunoreactivity was detected on the cell surface of human umbilical vein and coronary artery endothelial cells by scanning electron exogenous big et-1 was added to permeabilized and nonpermeabilized cultured human umbilical vein endothelial and ece activity was measured by the detection of et-like immunoreactivity in the culture a marked increase in ece activity was observed in permeabilized indicating that ece may also be expressed in intracellular confocal microscopy revealed intense immunofluorescence staining for big et-1 and the 2 isoforms of ece-1 (ece-1alpha and ece-1beta) in the perinuclear region and in weibel-palade bodies of the human umbilical vein endothelial stimulated degranulation of storage granules by the calcium ionophore a23187 caused release of et into the culture the findings of this study indicate that big et-1 is processed to the mature vasoactive peptide by eces located within endothelial storage we hypothesize that this activity may be important in the regulated mobilization of et in human endothelial
direct actions of gonadal steroid hormones on fsh secretion and expression in the infantile female fsh-beta mrna is dramatically regulated in the infantile female rat anterior elevated plasma levels of fsh correspond with increased fsh-beta mrna levels which peak on pnd the source of this regulation does not appear to be since the administration of a potent gnrh antagonist does not suppress fsh-beta mrna we have examined the effects of the gonadal steroid estrogen and on the maintenance of gonadotropin secretion and gene expression both in vivo and in androgen and estrogen action was blocked in vivo with the specific receptor flutamide (150 microg) and tamoxifen (200 administration of antagonists during two different three day time-periods of infantile life [postnatal day (pnd) 8-11 and pnd 11-14] resulted in differing effects on both fsh and lh secretion as well as on fsh-beta and lh-beta mrna flutamide and tamoxifen treatment both suppressed fsh secretion at either age examined (p < lh secretion was suppressed by both treatments but only at the younger of the two ages (p < in contrast to its effects on fsh tamoxifen suppressed fsh-beta mrna levels in the later group lh-beta mrna levels were suppressed by but only in the younger age group (p < the direct effects of steroid hormones on infantile pituitary gonadotrophs were examined in vitro by incubating cells with dihydrotestosterone propionate 10(-8) m) or 17beta-estradiol 10(-8) both dht and e treatment stimulated fsh secretion when measured 48 h later (p < there were no effects on lh fsh-beta mrna levels were also stimulated by dht at 48 h (p < estradiol treatment transiently increased fsh-beta mrna levels at 2 and 6 h following treatment (p < but not at 48 lh-beta levels were suppressed by dht treatment (p < and e transiently elevated lh-beta mrna levels at 2 h (p < taken together these studies indicate that gonadotrophs from infantile female rats are capable of responding directly to steroid and may play a role in the selective stimulation of fsh secretion and expression in
insulin down-regulates angiotensinogen gene expression and angiotensinogen secretion in cultured adipose adipose tissue is an important source of angiotensinogen (at) after since an association exists between body mass and the role of insulin on the regulation of at gene expression and at secretion was examined in cultured ob1771 and 3t3-f442a adipose within a physiological range of concentrations (1-17 insulin exerted a negative effect on the abundance of at mrna and the secretion of alterations of insulin-resistance by treatment of adipose cells with tnf-alpha or the thiazolidinedione brl49653 led respectively to a decrease or an increase in the potency of insulin to down-regulate at gene whereas maximal inhibition by insulin increased from 30% in tnfalpha-treated cells to 60% in brl49653-treated these results suggest that a potential link between insulin resistance and high blood pressure may exist by means of increased at secretion from adipose especially in obese copyright 1998 academic
