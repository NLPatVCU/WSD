differential modes of nuclear localization signal (nls) recognition by three distinct classes of nls the targeting of karyophilic proteins to nuclear pores is mediated via the formation of a nuclear pore-targeting through the interaction of nuclear localization signal (nls) with its nls a novel human was identified from a yeast two-hybrid system with dna helicase this study demonstrates that qip1 is a novel third class of nls receptor that efficiently recognizes the nls of the helicase the data obtained in this study show that the specific interaction between qip1 and the nls of the helicase q1 requires its upstream sequence of the minimal essential by using purified recombinant proteins alone in the digitonin-permeabilized cell-free transport it was demonstrated that the two known human nls rch1 and are able to transport all the tested nls substrates into the while qip1 most efficiently transports the helicase q1-nls which contain its upstream sequence in so far as we have examined the in hela cell crude it was found that endogenous rch1 binds to all the tested nls while the binding of endogenous npi-1 is restricted to only some despite the fact that npi-1 itself shows binding activity to a variety of these results indicate that at least three structurally and functionally distinct nls receptors exist in the human single cell and suggest that the nuclear import of karyophilic proteins may be controlled in a complex manner at the nls recognition step by the existence of a variety of nls receptors with various specificities to each
characterization of diadenosine polyphosphate transport into chromaffin granules from adrenal the transport of diadenosine polyphosphates into chromaffin granules from bovine adrenal medulla has been studied by using the radiolabeled substrate [3h]ap5a and the fluorescent substrate analog epsilon-(ap(n)a) the vesicular concentration increase was time dependent and the substrates were not metabolized to any extent during the transport the saturation curve indicates the existence of kinetic and allosteric cooperativity during ap(n)a (diadenosine polyphosphates) transport and could be the result of the presence of various affinity states of the transporter with k values of 16 +/- 1 microm and 75 +/- 6 and corresponding hill numbers of 2 and when epsilon-(ap4a) was the the saturation studies for [3h]ap5a were performed in a broader concentration in this case a three-step curve was obtained with k values of 16 +/- 2 125 +/- 9 and 545 +/- 11 the corresponding hill numbers were and this kinetic behavior can be explained on the basis of a mnemonic as already demonstrated for the vesicular transport of the nonhydrolyzable adenine nucleotide atpgammas and inhibited the diadenosine polyphosphate transport at concentrations in the millimolar ap(n)a transport was also inhibited by the p2 receptor antagonist the mitochondrial atp/adp exchange inhibitor the proton translocator and

characterization and regulation of taurine transport in human intestinal we characterized the taurine transport system in human intestinal caco-2 cells and showed that it is subject to adaptive the activity of taurine transport in caco-2 cells was evaluated by means of an na+- and cl(-)-dependent high-affinity transport the characteristics of which were similar to those of the beta-amino acid-specific taurine transport system previously described for various the activity of taurine transport was down-regulated on culturing in taurine-containing this taurine-induced down-regulation was dependent on both the incubation time with taurine and the concentration of hypotaurine and beta-alanine were also capable of inducing this adaptive whereas alpha-amino acids and gamma-aminoisobutyric acid were kinetic analysis of control and taurine-treated cells suggested that the down-regulation was associated with a decrease in the maximal velocity of taurine transport and also with a decrease in the affinity of the taurine cycloheximide treatment weakened the taurine-induced the mrna level of the taurine transporter (htau type) in taurine-treated cells was markedly decreased compared with in control these results indicate that a complex regulatory mechanism is involved in this characterization and regulation of taurine transport in human intestinal we characterized the taurine transport system in human intestinal caco-2 cells and showed that it is subject to adaptive the activity of taurine transport in caco-2 cells was evaluated by means of an na+- and cl(-)-dependent high-affinity transport the characteristics of which were similar to those of the beta-amino acid-specific taurine transport system previously described for various the activity of taurine transport was down-regulated on culturing in taurine-containing this taurine-induced down-regulation was dependent on both the incubation time with taurine and the concentration of hypotaurine and beta-alanine were also capable of inducing this adaptive whereas alpha-amino acids and gamma-aminoisobutyric acid were kinetic analysis of control and taurine-treated cells suggested that the down-regulation was associated with a decrease in the maximal velocity of taurine transport and also with a decrease in the affinity of the taurine cycloheximide treatment weakened the taurine-induced the mrna level of the taurine transporter (htau type) in taurine-treated cells was markedly decreased compared with in control these results indicate that a complex regulatory mechanism is involved in this
effect of osmolality and myo-inositol deprivation on the transport properties of myo-inositol in primary astrocyte myo-inositol uptake measured in primary astrocyte cultures was saturable in the presence of na+ with a km of 13-18 microm and a vmax of nmoles/mg protein/hour in myo-inositol-fed indicating a high affinity transport in myo-inositol-deprived km was about 53 microm with a vmax of nmoles/mg decreasing osmolality decreased the vmax to about nmoles/mg protein/hour whereas increasing osmolality increased vmax about while kms were essentially unchanged in myo-inositol fed in cells deprived of vmax decreased in hypotonic medium and increased in hypertonic medium almost but with more than a doubling of the km regardless of the glucose (25 mm) inhibited myo-inositol uptake 51% whereas the other hexoses used inhibited uptake much our findings indicate that myo-inositol uptake in astrocytes occurs through an efficient carrier-mediated na(+)-dependent co-transport system that is different from that of glucose and its kinetic properties are affected by myo-inositol availability and osmotic
deficient muscle carnitine transport in primary carnitine primary carnitine deficiency is associated with deficient blood and tissue carnitine the clinical syndrome is dominated by heart and skeletal muscle and the clinical response to oral carnitine supplementation is carnitine uptake has been shown to be defective in cultured skin fibroblasts and leukocytes obtained from patients with this we report a new case of primary carnitine deficiency and offer direct evidence consistent with an impairment of carnitine uptake in differentiating muscle the patient presented with severe and progressive cardiomyopathy and moderate proximal limb plasma and muscle carnitine levels were very and the maximal rate of carnitine transport in cultured fibroblasts was an asymptomatic sister with intermediate levels of carnitine in plasma showed partially deficient carnitine uptake in indicating the condition improved dramatically with oral carnitine further studies were performed in cultured muscle cells at different stages of which demonstrated deficient maximal rates of carnitine our findings are consistent with the concept that primary carnitine deficiency is the result of a generalized defect involving carnitine transport across tissue
segmental difference of water and electrolyte transport in rat colon in the segmental difference of water and electrolyte transport in the rat colon was studied in the proximal and distal colon segments were perfused separately but simultaneously at a constant rate with physiological and net movements of sodium and chloride were the effects of osmolality and sodium concentration of perfusate were the effect of a sodium channel blocker on the net transport of water and electrolytes was also studied in each colon the net absorption of sodium and chloride correlated with the sodium concentration and osmolality of the perfusion solution in both colon segments and were dominant in the distal colon segment in each compared with that in the proximal colon the concentrations of three electrolytes in the collected fluid were almost the same as those of the perfusion solutions in both segments and these results indicated that water was transported isotonically through the colon a specific sodium ion channel inhibited net water and sodium absorption by and in the proximal colon segment and by and in the distal colon these results suggest the existence of an electrogenic sodium transport mechanism and a paracellular pathway in normal not treated with corticosteroids or sodium-depleted food) rats which has not been detected in in vitro studies with both apical and basolateral membrane
changes in calcium transport in mammalian sperm mitochondria and plasma membranes caused by 780 nm background and regulation of intracellular ca2+ concentrations are very important in control of sperm motility and acrosome it was shown previously that low-power lasers in the visible and near-infrared range alter ca2+ uptake by sperm in the present work the effect of a 780 nm diode laser on ca2+ uptake by sperm mitochondria and isolated plasma membrane vesicles is study design/materials and digitonin-treated spermatozoa and plasma membrane vesicles were irradiated with a 780-nm diode laser at various powers and energy and ca2+ uptake was measured by the filtration it was found that 780-nm irradiation inhibits ca2+ uptake by the mitochondria but stimulates ca2+ binding by sperm plasma membrane the effect of light on ca2+ uptake by plasma membrane vesicles in the absence of atp was much larger than that measured in the presence of addition of ca2+ ionophore decreased the ca2+ uptake by the irradiated membranes in the presence of atp but enhanced it significantly in the absence of 780 nm light inhibits ca2+ uptake by sperm mitochondria and enhances ca2+ binding to sperm plasma

new evidence for two mhc class ii-restricted antigen presentation pathways by overexpression of a small g exogenous ags may be presented by mhc class ii molecules through two distinct pathways distinguished by their sensitivity to drugs that inhibit the protein using this we previously showed that the subunits ig-alpha and associated to b cell ag targeted ags either to newly synthesized or to preexisting pools of mhc class ii to further characterize these two ag presentation we altered the intra-golgi transport of newly synthesized mhc class ii by stably in b mutants of a small g protein involved in the intra-golgi overexpression of gtp-bound rab6 (q72l) mutant proteins reduced the cell surface arrival of mhc class ii molecules and consequently slowed down ag presentation dependent upon newly synthesized class ii in this mutant had no effect on ag presentation dependent upon preexisting pools of class ii and the overexpression of an inactive gdp-bound form of rab6 (t27n) did not affect any ag presentation mhc class ii-restricted ag presentation pathways can therefore be distinguished by their sensitivity to the overexpression of proteins modifying the intracellular transport of newly synthesized class ii

brownian dynamics study of ion transport in the vestibule of membrane brownian dynamics simulations have been carried out to study the transport of ions in a vestibular which offers a more realistic shape for membrane channels than cylindrical we consider a torus-shaped for which the analytical solution of equation is the system is composed of the toroidal with length and radius of the constricted region of 80 a and 4 and two reservoirs containing 50 sodium ions and 50 chloride the positions of each of these ions executing brownian motion under the influence of a stochastic force and a systematic electric force are determined at discrete time steps of 50 fs for up to all of the systematic forces acting on an ion due to the other an external electric fixed charges in the channel and the image charges induced at the water-protein boundary are explicitly included in the we find that the repulsive dielectric force arising from the induced surface charges plays a dominant role in channel it expels an ion from the vestibule when it is deliberately put in even in the presence of an applied electric potential of 100 an ion cannot overcome this repulsive force and permeate the only when dipoles of a favorable orientation are placed along the sides of the transmembrane segment can an ion traverse the channel under the influence of a membrane when the strength of the dipoles is further an ion becomes detained in a potential and the driving force provided by the applied field is not sufficient to drive the ion out of the the trajectory of an ion navigating across the channel mostly remains close to the central axis of the pore we discuss the implications of these findings for the transport of ions across the

deletion of algk in mucoid pseudomonas aeruginosa blocks alginate polymer formation and results in uronic acid chronic pulmonary infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common and serious problem in patients with cystic fibrosis the aeruginosa isolates from these patients typically have a mucoid colony morphology due to overproduction of the exopolysaccharide which contributes to the persistence of the organisms in the cf most of the alginate biosynthetic genes are clustered in the algd located at 34 min on the alginate biosynthesis begins with the formation of an activated which is known to occur via the products of the and algd polymannuronate forms in the but the gene products involved in mannuronate translocation across the inner membrane and its polymerization are not one locus of the operon which remained uncharacterized was a new gene called algk between alg44 and we sequenced algk from the mucoid cf isolate frd1 and expressed it in escherichia which revealed a polypeptide of the predicted size (52 the sequence of algk showed an apparent signal peptide characteristic of a algk-phoa fusion proteins were constructed and shown to be indicating that algk has a periplasmic subcellular to test the phenotype of an the algk coding sequence was replaced with a nonpolar gentamicin resistance cassette to avoid polar effects on genes downstream of algk that are essential for polymer the algkdelta mutant was demonstrating that algk was required for alginate algk- mutants demonstrated a small-colony phenotype on l suggesting that the loss of algk also caused a growth the mutant phenotypes were complemented by a plasmid expressing algk in when the algkdelta mutation was placed in an where alga was not expressed due to polar transposon the growth defect was not algk- mutants appeared to accumulate a toxic extracellular and we hypothesized that this could be an unpolymerized alginate high levels of low-molecular-weight uronic acid were produced by the algk- when algk- culture supernatants were subjected to high levels of uronic acids diffused out of the dialysis and no uronic acids were detectable after extensive in the mucoid wild-type strain produced only polymerized uronic acids whereas the algkdelta mutant produced no uronic the alginate pathway in an algk- mutant was blocked after transport but at a step before suggesting that algk plays an important role in the polymerization of mannuronate to
uptake of long chain fatty acids by human placental choriocarcinoma (bewo) role of plasma membrane fatty acid-binding in order to understand the mechanisms by which fatty acids are taken up by the the uptake of and docosahexaenoic acids by cultured human placental choriocarcinoma (bewo) cells was fatty acid uptake by bewo cells was temperature-dependent and exhibited saturable oleic acid was taken up least and docosahexaenoic acid most by these competitive studies of fatty acid uptake by bewo cells also indicated preferential uptake compared with oleic acid in the order of docosahexaenoic arachidonic and linoleic western blot analysis demonstrated that bewo cells express a protein immunoreactive with antibodies to the human placental plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein pre-treatment of bewo cells with these antibodies inhibited most of the uptake of docosahexaenoic (64%) and arachidonic acids (68%) whereas oleic acid uptake was inhibited only 32% compared with the controls treated with preimmune these results clearly demonstrate that the pfabppm may be involved in the preferential uptake of essential fatty acids (efa) and their long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (lcpufa) by these studies on the distribution of radiolabeled fatty acids in the cellular lipids of bewo cells showed that docosahexaenoic acid was incorporated mainly in the triacylglycerol followed by the phospholipid whereas for arachidonic acid the reverse was the preferential incorporation of docosahexaenoic acid into triacylglycerol suggests that triacylglycerol may play an important role in the placental transport of docosahexaenoic acid to the fetal together these results demonstrate the preferential uptake of efa/lcpufa by bewo cells that is most probably mediated via the we thus propose that the p-fabppm may be involved in the sequestration of maternal plasma lcpufa by the
na+ influx and na(+)-k+ pump activation during short-term exposure of cardiac myocytes to to examine the effect of aldosterone on sarcolemmal na+ we measured ouabain-sensitive electrogenic na(+)-k+ pump current (ip) in voltage-clamped ventricular myocytes and intracellular na+ activity (alpha ina) in right ventricular papillary aldosterone (10 nm) induced an increase in both ip and the rate of rise of alpha ina during na(+)-k+ pump blockade with the fast-acting cardiac steroid the aldosterone-induced increase in ip and rate of rise of alpha ina was eliminated by suggesting that aldosterone activates na+ influx through the na(+)-k(+)-2cl- to obtain independent support for the and cl- concentrations in the superfusate and solution of pipettes used to voltage clamp myocytes were set at levels designed to abolish the inward electrochemical driving force for the na(+)-k(+)-2cl- this eliminated the aldosterone-induced increase in we conclude that in vitro exposure of cardiac myocytes to aldosterone activates the na(+)-k(+)-2cl- cotransporter to enhance na+ influx and stimulate the na(+)-k+
hco3- absorption in rabbit outer medullary collecting role of luminal carbonic membrane-bound luminal carbonic anhydrase (ca) by catalyzing the dehydration of carbonic acid into co2 plus facilitates h+ secretion in the renal outer medullary collecting duct from the inner stripe to examine the role of ca iv on h+ we measured net hco3- transport in perfused omcdi segments and examined the effect on transport of two extracellular ca benzolamide and aminobenzolamide coupled to a nontoxic polyoxyethylene bis(acetic acid) [synthesized and kindly provided by conroy and maren and these agents would inhibit only the luminal ca dose titration curves for net hco3- flux were performed for each basal hco3- absorptive flux was 12 in control segments and significantly increased to 16 in segments from 3-day acid-treated the concentrations of benzolamide and f-3500 that inhibited hco3- absorption by 50% were approximately and approximately 5 similar to the ki for ca iv inhibition by these agents and and adding exogenous ca to the inhibitor in the perfusate nearly restored basal hco3- suggesting that cytosolic ca ii was not inhibited by these impermeant in omcdi segments from acidotic the concentrations of benzolamide and f-3500 that inhibited hco3- absorption by 50% were 50 and 500 > 100 times the ki for ca iv inhibition and for inhibition of hco3- transport in control in the doses of extracellular ca inhibitors that inhibited approximately 50% of ca iv activity also comparably inhibited hco3- indicating that h+ secretion depends in part on the availability of luminal ca iv acidosis substantially decreased the sensitivity of hco3- transport to ca
effect of a lysine-enriched diet on l-lysine transport by the brush-border membrane of the chicken the influx of l-lysine into apical vesicles from the chicken jejunum occurs through two one with low michaelis constant (k(m)) and features of system and the other with relatively high k(m) for l-lysine and with properties of system in the present study the effect of a lysine-enriched diet containing 68 g l-lysine/kg dietary control animals 48 g/kg) on l-lysine uptake through both transport systems was results show that 1) lysine enrichment had no effect on either body weight or the efficiency of food 2) in lys-fed the mediated l-lysine influx was best fitted to the two-system model with y+ and 3) in the presence of an na+ total l-lysine uptake is significantly higher in lys-fed animals than in control birds (about 40% 4) lys diet increases 6-fold (kscn gradient) and 12-fold (nascn gradient) and maximum velocity (vmax) by 6- and the effects of lys enrichment on the y(+)-like system are only observed on the vmax and in the presence of a na+ gradient (30% 5) na+ is involved in the activation of the transport process in the lys-fed but there is no correlation between external na+ concentration and l-lysine in both and y(+)-like transport systems are upregulated by dietary lysine but with different kinetic the high-capacity y(+)-like carrier shows a vmax increase without changes in whereas the low-capacity system shows an increase in vmax as well as in the
juxtaglomerular cell complex in the regulation of renal salt luminal nacl concentration at the macula densa (md) has the two established effects of regulating glomerular arteriolar resistance and renin tubuloglomerular feedback the inverse relationship between md nacl concentration and glomerular filtration rate stabilizes distal salt delivery and thereby nacl excretion in response to random perturbations unrelated to changes in body salt control of vasomotor tone by tgf is exerted primarily by nacl transport-dependent changes in local adenosine during long-lasting perturbations of md nacl control of renin secretion becomes the dominant function of the the potentially maladaptive effect of tgf under chronic conditions is prevented by tgf permitting adjustments in gfr to tgf adaptation is mechanistically coupled to the end point targeted by chronic deviations in md the rate of local and systemic angiotensin ii md control of renin secretion is the result of the coordinated action of local mediators that include nitric oxide synthase (nos) and cyclooxygenase (cox) thus vascular smooth muscle cell activation during high md transport and granular cell activation during low md transport is achieved by different extracellular the coordinated regulation of nos i and cox-2 expression in md cells and of renin expression in granular cells suggests that control of juxtaglomerular regulation of gene transcription or mrna metabolism may be another consequence of a chronic alteration in md nacl
genetics of renal mechanisms of primary the role of to summarize data concerning the identification of adducin as a gene in the milan hypertensive strain of rats a genetic model of essential and in human essential the sequence of events from renal function to cell membrane ion transports and finally to the molecular defect has been established in mhs this led to the identification of polymorphisms in the cytoskeletal protein these polymorphisms are involved in blood pressure regulation in these a linkage and an association study on caucasian populations support the involvement of adducin in human hypertension a polymorphism of alpha-adducin gene is significantly associated with human in both in humans and in adducin polymorphisms affect kidney function by modulating the overall capacity of tubular epithelial cells to transport adducin polymorphisms account for only a portion of hypertension both in humans and therefore additive or epistatic interactions with other genes involved in renal sodium handling need to be
regulation of the glial na+-dependent glutamate transporters by cyclic amp analogs and sodium-dependent transport into astrocytes is critical for maintaining the extracellular concentrations of glutamate below toxic levels in the central nervous in this the expression of the glial glutamate transporters glt-1 and glast was studied in primary cultures derived from cortical in primary glast protein levels were approximately one half of those observed in cortical but glt-1 protein was present at very low levels compared with cortical maintenance of these astrocytes in medium supplemented with dibutyryl-camp (dbcamp) caused a dramatic change in cell increased glt-1 and glast mrna levels approximately increased glast protein approximately and increased glt-1 protein these increases in protein expression were accompanied by 2-fold increases in the vmax and km values for na+-dependent l-[3h]glutamate transport although glt-1 is sensitive to inhibition by dihydrokainate in heterologous expression no dihydrokainate sensitivity was observed in astrocyte cultures that expressed biotinylation with a membrane-impermeant separation of the biotinylated/cell surface and subsequent western blotting demonstrated that both glt-1 and glast were present at the cell coculturing of astrocytes with neurons also induced expression of which colocalized with the glial specific glial fibrillary acidic neurons induced a small increase in glast several studies were performed to examine the mechanism by which neurons regulate expression of the glial three different protein kinase a (pka) antagonists did not block the effect of neurons on glial expression of glt-1 but the addition of dbcamp to mixed cultures of neurons and astrocytes did not cause glt-1 protein to increase this suggests that neurons do not regulate glt-1 by activation of pka but that neurons and dbcamp regulate glt-1 protein through convergent as was observed with the increases in glast protein observed in cocultures were not blocked by pka but unlike the addition of dbcamp to mixed cultures of neurons and astrocytes caused glast protein to increase approximately neurons separated from astrocytes with a semipermeable membrane increased glt-1 indicating that the effect of neurons was mediated by a diffusible treatment of cocultures with high concentrations of either n-methyl-d-aspartate or glutamate killed the caused glt-1 protein to and caused glast protein to these studies suggest that glt-1 and glast protein are regulated independently in astrocyte cultures and that a diffusible molecule secreted by neurons induces expression of glt-1 in
mechanism of prostaglandin e2 transport across the plasma membrane of hela cells and xenopus oocytes expressing the prostaglandin transporter we recently identified a novel prostaglandin transporter called pgt and (1995) science based on initial functional we have hypothesized that pgt might mediate the release of newly synthesized prostaglandins epithelial transport of or metabolic clearance of here we examined the mechanism of pgt transport as expressed in hela cells and xenopus using isotopic pg influx and efflux in both native hela cells and cell membranes were poorly permeable to in in oocytes injected with pgt the pg influx permeability coefficient was 90-157 times that of oocytes injected with the rank order substrate profile was pgf2alpha approximately pge2 > txb2 >> 6 pg influx displayed an overshoot with rapid accumulation of tracer followed by a gradual return to based on estimated oocyte the pgt-mediated accumulation of pge2 reached steady state at intra-oocyte concentrations 25-fold higher than the external the accumulation of pg was not due to intracellular binding or pgt-mediated uptake was atp- and but not and was inhibited by disulfonic niflumic and the thiol reactive anion mtses [3h]pge2 efflux from pgt-transfected hela cells was stimulated by external (trans) pge2 in a dose-dependent fashion and was inhibited by bromcresol green and membrane depolarization inhibited uptake of consistent with a model of net outward movement of negative charge during the translocation these findings suggest that pgt mediates [3h]pge2 accumulation via electrogenic anion
modulation of bicarbonate secretion in rabbit the role of surface epithelial bicarbonate secretion protects the proximal duodenum from acid peptic cyclic adenosine monophosphate and calcium serve as intracellular mediators of intestinal experiments were performed to examine whether calcium participates in duodenal bicarbonate stripped duodenal mucosa from rabbits was studied in ussing hco3- transport was stimulated by the calcium ionophore vasoactive intestinal prostaglandin dibutyryl-cyclic adenosine and electrical field a23187 stimulated hco3- secretion and tetrodotoxin failed to inhibit this the calcium-channel blocker verapamil abolished hco3- secretion stimulated by vasoactive intestinal and electrical field but failed to alter prostaglandin e2- or dibutyryl-cyclic adenosine monophosphate-stimulated hco3- calcium is likely required during stimulation of duodenal epithelial hco3- transport by vasoactive intestinal and electrical field prostaglandin e2 and dibutyryl-cyclic adenosine monophosphate appear to activate duodenal hco3- secretion by a calcium-independent
dip5p mediates high-affinity and high-capacity transport of l-glutamate and l-aspartate in saccharomyces genes encoding homologues of known amino-acid permeases were deleted in a strain also deficient in the general amino-acid the uptake capacity of the mutants was investigated for several l-alpha-amino deletion of a gene denoted dip5 results in the loss of l-aspartate and l-glutamate the dip5 mutation caused a several hundred-fold reduction of uptake of the two amino both in cells grown on proline as a nitrogen source and in cells grown on dip5-dependent uptake of l-aspartate and l-glutamate was somewhat lower in ammonium-grown cells than in proline-grown transcriptional regulation is at least partially responsible for this as shown by assaying the dip5 promoter fused to this suggests that the promoter is subject to nitrogen catabolite transport of a few other amino acids was moderately affected by dip5 but was not competed by l-aspartate in the dip5 parental transport of these amino acids is therefore unlikely to be mediated by our results suggest that dip5 encodes an amino-acid permease with a high transport capacity and a high affinity for l-glutamate and with a kt of about 50 microm for
stealth pla-peg nanoparticles as protein carriers for nasal the aim of the study was to encapsulate a model protein tetanus toxoid within hydrophobic (pla) and surface hydrophilic (pla-peg) nanoparticles and to evaluate the potential of these colloidal carriers for the transport of proteins through the nasal tt-loaded prepared by a modified water-in-oil-in-water solvent evaporation were characterized in their zeta potential and nanoparticles were also assayed in vitro for their ability to deliver active antigen for extended periods of 125i-tt-loaded nanoparticles were administered intranasally to rats and the amount of radioactivity recovered in the blood lymph nodes and other relevant tissues was monitored for up to 48 pla and pla-peg nanoparticles had a similar particle size (137-156 nm) and negative surface but differed in their surface pla were more hydrophobic than pla-peg pla-peg especially those containing gelatine as an provided extended delivery of the active the transport of the radiolabeled protein through the rat nasal mucosa was highly affected by the surface properties of the pla-peg nanoparticles led to a much greater penetration of tt into the blood circulation and the lymph nodes than pla after administration of 125i-tt-loaded pla-peg it was found that a high amount of radioactivity persisted in the blood compartment for at least 48 a novel nanoparticulate system has been developed with excellent characteristics for the transport of proteins through the nasal

thermodynamic evidence for conformational coupling between the b and c domains of the mannitol transporter of escherichia enzyme the transport across the cytoplasmic membrane and concomitant phosphorylation of mannitol in escherichia coli is catalyzed by the mannitol-specific transport protein from the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase enzyme interactions between the cytoplasmic b and the membrane embedded c domain play an important role in the catalytic cycle of this but the nature of this interaction is largely we have studied the thermodynamics of binding of (i) mannitol to enzyme (ii) the substrate analog perseitol to enzyme (iii) perseitol to phosphorylated enzyme and (iv) mannitol to enzyme iimtl treated with trypsin to eliminate the cytoplasmic analysis of the heat capacity increment of these reactions showed that approximately 50-60 residues are involved in the binding of mannitol and but far less in the phosphorylated state or after removal of the b a model is proposed in which binding of mannitol leads to the formation of a contact interface between the two either by folding of unstructured parts or by docking of preexisting thus positioning the incoming mannitol close to the phosphorylation site on the b domain to facilitate the transfer of the phosphoryl
identification of components of trans-golgi network-derived transport vesicles and detergent-insoluble complexes by nanoelectrospray tandem mass epithelial cells have to deliver newly synthesized proteins to the apical and the basolateral plasma membrane domains of the polarized cell sorting takes place in the trans-golgi network and at least two vesicular carriers exist for apical and basolateral after the composition of these vesicle preparations was analyzed by two-dimensional (2-d) gel electrophoresis and detergent in this paper we compare the constituents of detergent-insoluble complexes in different cell lines of polarized or nonpolarized origin and present the identification of five previously uncharacterized we show that our protein identification strategy can be successfully applied to the problem of small hydrophobic proteins from organisms that have not been substantially the high sensitivity of nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry allowed us to identify two proteins that belong to the p23/p24 family of putative cargo receptors for vesicular furthermore we have mapped cd9 and two members of a large family of proteins consisting of highly hydrophobic four transmembrane in addition we have identified caveolin-2 as a constituent of basolateral transport we have also extended our analysis of immuno-isolated vesicles to a more basic pi range and show that this region on 2-d gels is devoid of with these approaches and with the previously published data we have now identified most of the major low molecular weight proteins recovered in detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched
separation of early steps in endocytic membrane we describe a simple subcellular fractionation scheme aimed at separating early endosomes from the plasma membrane in view of studying the possible arrival of plasma membrane-bound proteins or other extracellular ligands in plasma membrane proteins were labeled with the impermeable reagent sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (nhs-lc) biotin at 4 degrees in a separate set of early endosomes were labeled by internalization of horseradish peroxidase from the medium for 5 the first step of the which consists of a step sucrose led to three enriched in biosynthetic membranes (interface in plasma membrane and early endosomes (interface and in late endosomes (interface the second in which interface 2 was loaded at the bottom of a 17% percoll led to the separation of the plasma including caveolae and cholesterol-glycolipid from early western blot analysis of the fractions from the percoll gradient showed that the transferrin the small gtpases rab5 and as well as annexin ii were present both at the plasma membrane and in early whereas the caveolar marker migrated only with the biotinylated plasma membrane we used this fractionation procedure to show that the pore-forming toxin aerolysin does not reach the endocytic compartments of baby hamster kidney (bhk) the procedure should be generally useful in rapidly determining whether extracellular proteins or ligands reach

molybdate binding by the periplasmic component of the escherichia coli mod molybdate transport the periplasmic-binding protein of the escherichia coli mod transport system was overexpressed and binding of molybdate and tungstate to moda was found to modify the uv absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of the titration of these changes showed that moda binds molybdate and tungstate in a molar moda showed an intrinsic fluorescence emission spectrum attributable to its three tryptophanyl molybdate binding caused a conformational change in the protein characterized (i) a shift of tryptophanyl groups to a more hydrophobic (ii) a quenching (at ph or enhancement (at ph of and (iii) a higher availability of tryptophanyl groups to the polar quencher the tight binding of molybdate did not allow an accurate estimation of the binding constants by these indirect an isotopic binding method with 99moo42- was used for accurate determination of kd (20 nm) and stoichiometry molar moda bound tungstate with approximately the same but did not bind sulfate or these kds are 150- to 250-fold lower than those previously and compatible with the high molybdate transport affinity of the mod the affinity of moda for molybdate was also determined in vivo and found to be similar to that determined in copyright 1998 elsevier science
role of nucleoside transport and purine release in a rabbit model of myocardial we have demonstrated the role of nucleoside transport and purine release in post-ischemic reperfusion injury (myocardial stunning) in several canine models of since rabbits are deficient of xanthine it is not known whether selective blockade of purine release is beneficial in a rabbit model of coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion we determined the hemodynamic and metabolic correlates in response to myocardial stunning in the presence or absence of selective nucleoside transport blocker nbmpr) and adenosine deaminase inhibitor sixty adult anaesthetized rabbits were surgically prepared for hemodynamic after stabilization the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 15 min and reperfused for 30 transmural myocardial biopsies were obtained from the ischemic lad area and from the non-ischemic posterior cfx) segment of the rabbits (n = 60) were randomly assigned to either the control or the ehna/nbmpr-treated group (n = 30 each group was further divided to either functional or metabolic groups (n = 15 each each animal received intravenously 30 ml of either a vehicle solution or 100 m ehna and 25 m nbmpr 10 min before although administration of ehna/nbmpr did not affect the heart it did cause mild hypotension (about fifteen minutes of lad occlusion resulted in significant atp depletion and concomitant accumulation of nucleosides in both groups (p < baseline and non-ischemic cfx amp was higher in the lad compared to the cfx significant accumulation of adenosine was observed in the treated group compared to the control it is concluded that ehna/nbmpr induced site specific entrapment of adenosine of nucleoside transport in the rabbit in

fatty acid difficult or transport of unesterified fatty acids (fa) into cells has been viewed either as a simple diffusion process regulated mainly by lipid physical chemistry or as a more complex process involving protein in this review fa transport in cell membranes is broken down into three essential transmembrane and the physical properties of fa in and protein environments relevant to transport mechanisms are with emphasis on recent information derived from nmr and fluorescence because of their low solubility in water and high fa bind rapidly and avidly to model membranes (phospholipid if albumin is a fa desorb rapidly to reach their equilibrium distribution between the membrane and the ionization properties of fa in a phospholipid bilayer result in a high population of the un-ionized form (approximately 50%) at ph which diffuses across the lipid bilayer (flip-flops) rapidly (t(1/2) < 1 desorption of fa from a phospholipid surface is slower than transmembrane movement and dependent on the fa chain length and but is rapid for typical dietary these physical properties of fa in model systems predict that proteins are not essential for transport of fa through the only putative fa transport protein to be purified and reconstituted into phospholipid the mitochondrial uncoupling protein was shown to transport the fa anion in response to fa new experiments with cells have found that fa movement into cells acidifies the as predicted by the flip-flop
[improvement of intestinal absorption of peptide and protein drugs by chemical modification with fatty it is well known that the oral bioavailability of peptide and protein drugs is generally poor because they are extensively degraded by proteases in the gastrointestinal tract and impermeable through the intestinal various approaches have been examined to overcome the delivery problems of these peptides and to improve their absorption via the gastrointestinal of these a potentially useful approach to solve these delivery problems may be chemical modification of peptides and proteins to produce prodrugs and it is plausible that this approach may protect peptides against degradation by peptidases and other enzymes present at the mucosal barrier and renders the peptides and proteins more resulting in increased from these we synthesized lipophilic derivatives of peptides and proteins such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone tetragastrin calcitonin and insulin by chemical modification with fatty the pharmacological activities of these derivatives were relatively high as compared with the native a significant increase in the intestinal absorption of these derivatives of peptides was observed in comparison with native the effects of acylation on the intestinal absorption of these peptides were more predominant in the large intestine than those in the small in these derivatives were more stable than the parent peptides in homogenates of the various intestinal we also examined the intestinal transport characteristics of tg and its acyl derivatives using caco-2 cell monolayers in order to assess the contribution of enzymatic and transport barriers on their intestinal the degradation clearance of tg on the apical membrane was decreased by chemical modification with fatty in the permeability clearance of tg was improved by the on the other the intestinal absorption of thyrotropin releasing hormone which is transported by a carrier-mediated was also enhanced by chemical modification with lauric in this chemical modification approach may be useful to improve the intestinal absorption of peptide and protein

adenosine and hypoxanthine transport in horse evidence for a polymorphism in the transport of hypoxanthine via a sodium-dependent the inward transport of two adenosine and at 37 degrees c by horse erythrocytes was no mediated transport of adenosine was detected in horse nor was high-affinity binding of the potent facilitated-diffusion inhibitor nitrobenzylthioinosine demonstrable in horse erythrocyte in erythrocytes from most horses possessed a saturable sodium-dependent hypoxanthine transporter (apparent 100 +/- 28 +/- mmol (l cells)-1 means +/- n = guanine inhibited hypoxanthine influx (apparent 24 +/- 6 but adenine and xanthine had no unlike human no sodium-independent hypoxanthine transporter was detected in horse there a small number of animals (approximately 15%) whose erythrocytes fail to transport this variation appears to be under genetic but the precise nature of the control is
time-dependent stimulation by aldosterone of blocker-sensitive enacs in a6 to study and define the early time-dependent response (< or = 6 h) of blocker-sensitive epithelial na+ channels (enacs) to stimulation of na+ transport by we used a new modified method of blocker-induced noise analysis to determine the changes of single-channel current (ina) channel open probability and channel density (nt) under transient conditions of transport as measured by macroscopic short-circuit currents in three groups of experiments in which spontaneous baseline rates of transport averaged and stimulation of transport occurred due to increase of blocker-sensitive nt varied linearly over a 70-fold range of transport relatively small and slow time-dependent but aldosterone-independent decreases of po occurred during control (10-20% over 2 h) and aldosterone experimental periods (10-30% over 6 when the po of control and aldosterone-treated tissues was examined over the 70-fold extended range of na+ po was observed to vary inversely with falling from approximately to approximately at the highest rates of na+ transport or approximately 25% per 3-fold increase of because decreases of po from any source cannot explain stimulation of transport by it is concluded that the early time-dependent stimulation of na+ transport in a6 epithelia is due exclusively to increase of apical membrane

ultrastructural changes and immunocytochemical localization of microtubule-associated protein 1 in guinea pig optic nerves after acute increase in intraocular to investigate ultrastructural changes and localization of microtubule-associated protein 1 (map 1) in optic nerves of guinea pigs in conditions of acute increase in intraocular pressure intraocular pressure was increased acutely in 40 guinea pig and 40 eyes were examined in 20 normal control analytic methods included quick-freezing and deep-etching (qf-de) and conventional microtubule-associated protein 1 immunocytochemistry was in conventional ultrathin an alteration of the axoplasmic ultrastructure was seen only at the level of the lamina cribrosa the number of microtubules was significantly decreased in the axoplasm that exhibited accumulations of membranous cross-bridged filaments on microtubules were significantly reduced in number when determined by the qf-de the immunostaining of tubulin or map 1 was less positive than in other samples with normal revealed by light microscopic immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that map 1 was significantly decreased in the axoplasm that showed accumulations of membranous the acute alteration of axoplasmic ultrastructures in some parts of the optic nerves at the level of the lamina cribrosa involves a decrease in the amount of map 1 and a decrease in the number of axonal cross-bridges on microtubules in a condition of acutely increased which could be related to microtubule instability and abnormal organelle transport in the
glutamine transport by the blood-brain a possible mechanism for nitrogen glutamine and glutamate transport activities were measured in isolated luminal and abluminal plasma membrane vesicles derived from bovine brain endothelial facilitative systems for glutamine and glutamate were almost exclusively located in luminal-enriched the facilitative glutamine carrier was neither sensitive to acid inhibition nor did it participate in accelerated amino acid it therefore appeared to be distinct from the neutral amino acid transport system two na-dependent glutamine transporters were found in abluminal-enriched systems a and system n accounted for approximately 80% of na-dependent glutamine transport at 100 abluminal-enriched membranes showed na-dependent glutamate transport the presence of 1) na-dependent carriers capable of pumping glutamine and glutamate from brain into endothelial 2) glutaminase within endothelial cells to hydrolyze glutamine to glutamate and and 3) facilitative carriers for glutamine and glutamate at the luminal membrane may provide a mechanism for removing nitrogen and nitrogen-rich amino acids from
assessment of glucosylifosfamide mustard biodistribution in rats with prostate adenocarcinomas by means of in vivo 31p nmr and in vitro uptake a combined in vitro/in vivo study was performed to evaluate the possible application of phosphorus (31p) nmr spectroscopy for therapy monitoring and to investigate glucosylifosfamide mustard (glc-ipm) transport and biodistribution by radiotracer dynamic in vivo 31p nmr measurements were performed in rats with prostate adenocarcinoma after injection of 1 mmol/kg body weight (bw) of ifosfamide (ifo) (n = 4) and 1 mmol/kg bw (n = 4) or mmol/kg bw (n = 9) of in a biodistribution study with 14c-labeled glc-ipm and a final dose of mmol glc-ipm/kg the animals were killed and 120 min after drug an ethanol extraction was performed from several and the dose per g tissue was the same tumor cell line was used in saturation and competition experiments to further elucidate the transport the 31p nmr signals of ifo and glc-ipm showed no overlap with the endogenous phosphorus a rapid washout with a half-life between +/- min for the lower dose and +/- min for the higher dose of glc-ipm was observed in the no statistically significant change of the ph value was observed during the examination the beta-nucleoside (ntp)/inorganic phosphate (pi) signal intensity ratio showed a tendency to decrease but without statistical a rapid elimination was demonstrated by both the noninvasive nmr technique and the biodistribution no saturation was found in vitro for the glc-ipm even at the concentration of 5 the glc-ipm uptake was not inhibited by the presence of 2-deoxyglucose and vice the data show that the pharmacokinetics of glc-ipm in the tumor can be followed in vivo by 31p the results presented are evidence for diffusion as the transport mechanism for glc-ipm in this tumor the better visualization of glc-ipm as compared to ifosfamide may be due to metabolic trapping of a negatively charged metabolite after
application of fractal kinetics for carrier-mediated transport of drugs across intestinal epithelial fractal kinetics was used for the analysis of the carrier-mediated transport for drugs across the intestinal epithelial the transport was examined under various agitation rates using a monolayer of caco-2 cells and rabbit ileum the passive transport of antipyrine across caco-2 cells was increased with the increasing rate of agitation and was supposed to be caused by a change in the thickness of the unstirred water on the in the case of l-lactic acid which follows a carrier-mediated transport the more the agitation rate controlling the fractal dimension was the more the permeability rate across the caco-2 cells was fractal kinetic analysis of l-lactic acid transport indicated that the permeability was caused by a single saturable similar agitation effects with l-lactic acid transport were observed in the transport of phenylalanine and cephradine in caco-2 the permeability rates of benzoic acid and 3-o-methyl-d-glucose across caco-2 cells and l-lactic acid transport across the rabbit ileum tissue indicated the maximum levels at a designated agitation this phenomenon was likely to be caused by the agitation effects controlling not only the fractal environment but also the unstirred water carrier-mediated transports are well defined by fractal kinetics rather than classical kinetic fractal kinetics are one of the important areas for understanding and confirming the properties of a carrier-mediated transport
dexamethasone treatment and plasma glucose relevance for fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake measurements in dexamethasone (dex) is frequently used in brain tumor this study investigated the effect of dex treatment and plasma glucose levels on 18f-fluorodeoxyglucose (fdg) uptake in patients with malignant gliomas (16 3 anaplastic fifteen dex-treated patients (mean relative dose +/- mg(-1) x kg(-1) x range four patients not treated with dex and nine healthy subjects were studied using pet and pet data obtained from tumors and the contralateral cortex were fitted to a standard two-tissue compartment the fdg transport and phosphorylation distribution volume steady-state accumulation deoxyglucose metabolism plasma volume as well as standardized uptake values (suvs) and tumor-to-brain ratios were in the tumor size was estimated from the maximal area of contrast-enhancing tumor on computed cranial tomography (cct) scans or fdg uptake was depressed in the contralateral cortex of patients and was related to tumor with increasing relative dex a decrease in the dv of tumors (linear regression p = and in the dv (p = and plasma volume (p = of contralateral cortex was ki and suvs in tumors and contralateral cortex were not related to the relative dex with increasing plasma glucose differential decreases in ki and suvs in tumors (p = and p = respectively) and contralateral cortex (p = and p = respectively) were the data suggest that dex affects fdg uptake in malignant gliomas through interaction with cerebral blood vessels and extracellular whereas fdg metabolism in tumors is not influenced this is of practical importance for patients having serial brain tumor imaging for treatment evaluation because patients may receive different dex doses at different time points in the course of their by the plasma glucose level must be considered a confounding variable when tumor-to-brain ratios or ki are used for treatment

nicotine transport in a human choriocarcinoma cell line smoking is a major health problem in pregnancy resulting in intrauterine growth retardation and birth a toxic component of cigarette interferes with amino acid transport in the placenta and stimulates catecholamine release resulting in uteroplacental transplacental transport of nicotine may be an important determinant of placental and fetal our aim was to determine the mechanism of nicotine transport in the human choriocarcinoma cell as a model for the jar cells were subcultured in 12-well plates following trypsinization at a seeding density of x 10(6) cells/well x 10(5) uptake studies of [3h]nicotine were carried out in jar cell monolayers on day 2 after [3h]nicotine uptake was saturable (km 156 sensitive to and inhibited by unlabeled nicotine and various organic cations including mecamylamine and but not by tetraethylammonium or counterflux of [3h]nicotine uptake was produced by unlabeled nicotine and mecamylamine but not by cotinine or consistent with a carrier-mediated transport the uptake could be driven by an inside-negative membrane potential or by an outwardly directed ph this is the first demonstration of a carrier-mediated transport mechanism for nicotine in a human cell this transport mechanism may have implications to the disposition of nicotine in the human
bovine herpesvirus-1 infection affects the peptide transport activity in bovine infection of cattle with bovine herpesvirus-1 (bhv-1) impairs the cell-mediated immune response (cmi) of the affected we investigated the location of interference of bhv-1 with the major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i antigen presentation pathway by employing an assay that allows assessment of the peptide transport activity of the transporter associated with antigen presentation (tap) from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum we found a considerable down-regulation of the peptide transport activity in bovine epithelial taking place as early as 2 h after virus this down-regulation was also at high multiplicities of infection led to an almost complete shutdown of by inhibiting peptide transport into the the virus impairs loading of mhc class i molecules and their subsequent egress from the er to the cell this may lead to defective priming of cytotoxic t bhv-1 is yet another member of its family herpesviridae that selectively interferes with the antigen presentation machinery to evade the immune response in

rab17 localizes to recycling endosomes and regulates receptor-mediated transcytosis in epithelial the small gtpase rab17 is restricted to epithelial cells and its expression is induced during cell this observation has led to the suggestion that the protein may function in a pathway connecting the apical and basolateral endocytic to analyze whether rab17 plays a role in transcellular we generated madin-darby canine kidney (mdck) cell lines stably coexpressing wild-type or mutant rab17 and the transcytotic polymeric immunoglobulin receptor rab17 expressed in mdck cells was found on small vesicles and tubules in the apical region of the a significant fraction of the rab17-positive structures was accessible to dimeric iga internalized from the apical or basolateral cell surface via the basolateral to apical transcytosis of dimeric iga was impaired in mdck cells overexpressing our data provides morphological and biochemical evidence for a role of rab17 in the regulation of transcellular traffic through apical recycling endosomes in epithelial
the snare machinery is involved in apical plasma membrane trafficking in mdck we have investigated the controversial involvement of components of the snare (soluble n-ethyl maleimide-sensitive factor [nsf] attachment protein [snap] receptor) machinery in membrane traffic to the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial (mdck) overexpression of syntaxin but not of syntaxins 2 or caused an inhibition of tgn to apical transport and apical and leads to an accumulation of small vesicles underneath the apical plasma all other tested transport steps were unaffected by syntaxin 3 botulinum neurotoxin which cleaves and antibodies against alpha-snap inhibit both tgn to apical and basolateral transport in a reconstituted in vitro in we find no evidence for an involvement of n-ethyl maleimide-sensitive factor in tgn to apical whereas basolateral transport is we conclude that syntaxin and alpha-snap are involved in apical membrane these results demonstrate that vesicle fusion with the apical plasma membrane does not use a mechanism that is entirely unrelated to other cellular membrane fusion but uses isoforms of components of the snare which suggests that they play a role in providing specificity to polarized membrane
doxorubicin- and daunorubicin-glutathione but not unconjugated competitively inhibit leukotriene c4 transport mediated by mrp/gs-x overexpression of the multidrug resistance-associated protein (mrp1) gene encoding a human gs-x pump in cultured cells resulted in increased cellular resistance to antitumor including doxorubicin (dox) and daunomycin as well as certain heavy studies with membrane vesicles prepared from the resistant cells revealed that dox and dau are poor substrates for the transport mediated by mrp/gs-x suggesting that metabolic modifications of these drugs might be required for the to test this we prepared four glutathione conjugates by linking the cysteine residue of gsh to dox and dau at eitehr the c-7 or c-14 the affinity of the synthesized conjugates toward mrp/gs-x pump was examined in the ltc4 transport assay using membrane vesicles prepared from an mrp1 gene-overexpressing cell unconjugated dox and dau failed to inhibit the transport of whereas 30 microm gs-dox or gs-dau conjugates completely inhibited the kinetic analyses revealed that the inhibition by these gs-conjugates is competitive with ki values ranging from 60 to 200 suggesting that these compounds have high affinities toward mrp/gs-x pump and share the common binding site(s) with our present results support the hypothesis that glutathionation can facilitate the transport of anthracyclines by the mrp/gs-x
effect of signal peptide changes on the extracellular processing of streptokinase from escherichia requirement for secondary structure at the cleavage streptokinase an extracellular protein from streptococcus is secreted post-translationally by escherichia coli using both its native and coli-derived transport in this communication we report that cleavage specificity of signal peptidase and thus efficiency of varies in coli when sk export is directed by different transport the native (+1) n-terminus of mature sk was retained when it was transported under the control of its pelb or lamb signal when translocation of sk was controlled by the ompa or male signal ala2 of mature sk was preferred as a cleavage site for the pre-sk our results indicate that compatibility of the leader peptide with the mature sequences of which fulfills the requirement for a given secondary structure within the cleavage is essential for maintaining the correct processing of an ompa-sk which results in the deletion of two n-terminal amino acid residues of mature was further studied with respect to the recognition of alternative cleavage site in the alanine at +2 in mature sk was changed to glycine or its relative position was changed to +3 by introducing a methionine residue at the +1 both alterations resulted in the correct cleavage of pre-sk at the original ompa fusion in introduction of an additional alanine at creating three probable cleavage sites resulted in the recognition of all three target sites for with varying the results indicate that the nature of the secondary structure generated at the cleavage junction of resulting from the fusion of different signal modulates the cleavage specificity of signal peptidase i during extracellular processing of based on these findings it is proposed that flexibility in the interaction of the active site of signal peptidase i with the cleavage sites of signal peptides may occur when it encounters two or more juxtaposed cleavage preference for one cleavage site over may depend on fulfillment of secondary structure requirements in the vicinity of the pre-protein cleavage

developmental regulation of invariant chain proteolysis controls mhc class ii trafficking in mouse dendritic dendritic cells (dcs) developmentally regulate their capacity for antigen presentation by controlling the transport and surface expression of mhc class ii these events reflect a developmental regulation of invariant (ii) chain most likely by the cysteine protease cathepsin in immature inefficient ii chain cleavage due to low cathepsin s activity leads to the transport of class ii-ii chain complexes to while in mature elevated cathepsin s activity results in efficient delivery of class ii alphabeta dimers to the plasma cathepsin s is not controlled transcriptionally but by a novel mechanism involving alterations in the expression and localization of an endogenous cathepsin s inhibitor cystatin the ratio of cystatin c to cathepsin s in developing dcs helps to determine the fate of newly synthesized mhc class ii
lactate production and clearance in effects of a lactate accumulates if pyruvate formation exceeds pyruvate accelerated glycogenolysis is essential for lactate glycogen and epinephrine enhance glycogen phosphorylase activity and this is higher in type ii b than in type i pyruvate oxidation is enhanced by exercise-induced increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and is relatively impaired by low oxygen availability and low mitochondrial oxidative during exercise lactate is eliminated in and resting and working in elimination depends on plasma fiber and fiber due to influence on hormonal mitochondrial oxidative capacity and fiber training diminishes glycogenolysis and lactate training also increases lactate this reflects increased hepatic capacity for gluconeogenesis as well as increased lactate transport capacity and oxidative capacity and reduced glycogenolysis in the fact that endurance performance can be predicted from the plasma lactate versus exercise intensity relationship illustrates that the plasma lactate level is a finely balanced result of the interplay between many factors of importance for endurance

preliminary results of bedside inferior vena cava filter safe and cost-effective [see the use of inferior vena cava filters (ivcfs) is increasing in patients at high risk for venous there is considerable controversy related to their we inserted eight percutaneous ivcfs at the the hospital charges for bedside ivcf insertion were substantially lower compared with those for ivcf insertion performed in the radiology department or operating there was one death (unrelated to the procedure) and one asymptomatic caval occlusion believed to be caused by thrombus bedside ivcf insertion is safe and cost-effective in selected this practice averts the potential complications associated with transporting critically ill
mathematical modelling of drug transport in emulsion two mathematical models for the prediction of drug transport in triphasic water and micellar) emulsion systems as a function of micellar concentration have been developed and these models were evaluated by comparing experimental and simulated first law was used to derive a transport model for hydrophilic assuming that the oil/water (o/w) partitioning process was fast compared with membrane transport and therefore drug transport was limited by the consecutive rate equations were used to model transport of hydrophobic drugs in emulsion systems assuming that the o/w interface acts as a barrier to drug benzoic acid and phenol were selected as hydrophilic model phenylazoaniline and benzocaine were selected as hydrophobic model transport studies at ph and were conducted using side-by-side diffusion according to the hydrophilic an increase in micellar concentration is expected to decrease drug transport the effective permeability coefficients (peff) of drugs were calculated using an equation relating peff and the total apparent volume of drug distribution (determined experimentally using drug/membrane permeability and partition coefficient the hydrophobic model was fitted to the experimental data for the cumulative amount of model drug in the receiver cells using a weighted least-squares estimation program the oil/continuous phase partitioning rates (k1) and the membrane transport rates (k2) were the goodness of fit was assessed from the correlation coefficients of plots of predicted versus experimental the predicted data were consistent with the experimental data for both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic
functional expression in lactobacillus plantarum of xylp encoding the isoprimeverose transporter of lactobacillus the xylp gene of lactobacillus the first gene of the xylpqr was recently found to be involved in isoprimeverose by expression of xylp on a multicopy plasmid in lactobacillus plantarum a strain which lacks active isoprimeverose and d-xylose transport it was shown that xylp encodes a functional expression of the xylp transporter was shown by uptake of isoprimeverose in plantarum 80 and this transport was driven by the proton motive force generated by malolactic xylp was unable to catalyze transport of
iontophoresis of monomeric insulin analogues in effects of insulin charge and skin the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of association state and net charge of human insulin analogues on the rate of iontophoretic transport across hairless mouse and the effect of different skin pretreatments on said no insulin flux was observed with anodal delivery probably because of degradation at the ag/agcl the flux during cathodal iontophoresis through intact skin was insignificant for human hexameric and only low and variable fluxes were observed for monomeric using stripped skin on the other the fluxes of monomeric insulins with two extra negative charges were 50-100 times higher than that of hexameric human introducing three additional charges led to a further 2-3-fold increase in wiping the skin gently with absolute alcohol prior to iontophoresis resulted in a 1000-fold increase in transdermal transport of insulin relative to that across untreated to almost the same level as stripping the the alcohol pretreatment reduced the electrical resistance of the presumably by lipid in monomeric insulin analogues with at least two extra negative charges can be iontophoretically delivered across hairless mouse whereas insignificant flux is observed with hexameric wiping the skin with absolute alcohol prior to iontophoresis gave substantially improved transdermal transport of monomeric insulins resulting in clinically relevant delivery rates for basal
phylogenetic approaches to the identification and characterization of protein families and with the advent of megabase genome the need for computational analyses increases sequencing errors must be encoded proteins must be functions must be assigned to these and distant phylogenetic relationships must be recognized in order to maximize the yield of information obtainable from genome sequencing both the computer and the human brain have their but using them in the biologist can vastly extend his or her analytic computer techniques can be used to estimate protein and in this the application of available computer programs to several protein particularly and transcriptional regulatory protein illustrate our current capabilities and although some multidomain protein families are evolutionarily others have mosaic evidence concerning the nature and frequency of occurrence of domain and duplication during evolution of specific protein families is it is shown that specific families of transport and transcriptional regulatory proteins share a common evolutionary frequently diverging in function because of domain splicing and some large families arose gradually over evolutionary whereas others developed due to bursts of intragenic or intergenic (or both) duplication events occurring over relatively short periods of it is argued that energy coupling to transport was a late superimposed on preexisting mechanisms of solute it is also shown that several transport protein families have evolved independently of each employing different at different times in evolutionary to give topologically similar transmembrane protein

interference of l-arginine analogues with l-arginine transport mediated by the y+ carrier the inducible human cationic amino acid transporter hcat-2b was expressed in xenopus laevis and this system was used to test the effect of several no synthase (nos) inhibitors and/or l-arginine analogues on l-arginine transport by this y+ l-ng-methyl-l-arginine asymmetrical ng-dimethyl-l-arginine l-n5-(1-iminoethyl)-ornithine l-ng-nitro-l-arginine and l-ng-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name) all inhibited the inducible nos ii extracted from raw macrophages induced with bacterial and l-nio also competed with l-arginine for transport by whereas l-nna and l-name did the two l-arginine symmetrical ng-dimethyl-l-arginine (l-sdma) and alpha-amino-delta-isothioureidovaleric acid as well as did not block enzymatic activity of nos but did compete for l-arginine transport mediated by l-lysine and l-sdma were transported efficiently by hcat-2b and exchanged against intracellular resulting in an l-arginine depletion of the aitv was a much poorer substrate of hcat-2b and had only little effect on intracellular l-arginine these data indicate that substrate recognition differs markedly between the inducible l-arginine transporter hcat-2b and the inducible nos with different l-arginine analogues having affinity to only one or both of these
the molecular characterization of transport endocytosis and transport to the lytic compartment are highly coordinated features of the eukaryotic these intracellular transport processes are facilitated by many of which are small (100 nm or less in diameter) and on their cytoplasmic research into the structure of the coat proteins and how they interact with the components of the vesicle membrane to ensure the selective packaging of the cargo molecules and their correct has been quite extensive in mammalian and yeast cell by our knowledge of the corresponding types of transport vesicles in plant cells is the available data indicate that a considerable homology between plant and non-plant coat polypeptides and it is also suggestive of a certain similarity in the mechanisms underlying targeting in all in this article we shall concentrate on three major types of transport clathrin-coated cop-coated and the latter of which are responsible for the transport of vacuolar storage proteins in maturing legume for each we will summarize the current literature on animal and yeast and then present the relevant data derived from work on plant in we briefly review the evidence in support of the which explains how vesicles find and fuse with their target
experimental elucidation of mechanical load-induced fluid flow and its potential role in bone metabolism and functional several researchers have developed theories implicating some manifestation of mechanical forces such as and strain energy density for the initiation of cellular processes associated with functional the mechanisms underlying dynamic bone growth and repair in response to mechanical are not fully load-induced fluid flow has been postulated to provide a mechanism for the transmission of mechanical signals via shear enhancement of molecular or electrical effects) and the subsequent elicitation of a functional adaptation response in although indirect evidence for such fluid flow phenomena can be found in the literature pertaining to strain-generated experimental studies are inherently this motivated the authors to develop theoretical as well as ex in and in vivo experimental methods for the study of transport processes and fluid flow within bone under well-controlled mechanical loading by introducing tracer substances such as disulphine procion and microperoxidase into the experimental transport and fluid flow could be visualized at and subcellular based on these it could be shown that load-induced fluid flow represents a powerful mechanism to enhance molecular transport within compact bone the distribution of transport-elucidating tracers is a function of mechanical loading parameters as well as the location within the cross-section of the bone
multiplicity of biliary excretion mechanisms for the camptothecin derivative irinotecan its metabolite and its role of canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter and a frequent dose-limiting effect of irinotecan (cpt-11) is its gastrointestinal toxicity which is thought to be related to biliary excretion of cpt-11 and its we have investigated the mechanism of biliary excretion of these in vivo pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the biliary excretion of the four anionic forms of cpt-11 and its metabolites was reduced in eisai hyperbilirubinemic which carry a mutation of the hepatic canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cmoat) the protein encoded by this gene is expressed on the bile canalicular membrane and is responsible for the transport of organic anions into detailed analysis using isolated liver bile canalicular membrane vesicles to identify transport systems showed that cmoat is responsible for biliary excretion of the low-affinity component of the carboxylate form of cpt-11 and the high-affinity component of both the lactone and carboxylate forms of sn-38 the carboxylate form of sn-38 is transported by cmoat transport of the high-affinity component of cpt-11 was inhibited by verapamil and but their effect on the transport of its low-affinity component was in atp dependence in the uptake of cpt-11 by membrane vesicles obtained from a p-glycoprotein (p-gp)-overexpressing cell line was thus p-gp may be responsible for transport of the high-affinity component of the carboxylate form of
atp-dependent copper transport by the menkes protein in membrane vesicles isolated from cultured chinese hamster ovary the menkes (mnk) protein is a vital component of copper homeostasis in mammalian in this paper we provide the first biochemical evidence that the mnk protein functions as a copper-translocating p-type atpase in mammalian the enzyme activity in membrane vesicles prepared from chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing mnk was correlated with the amount of mnk and followed michaelis-menten kinetics with respect to the copper transport was observed only under reducing conditions suggesting mnk transports this study opens the way to detailed structure-function studies and assessment of functional mnk derived from patients with menkes
effect of diuretics on sodium and chloride permeability in the rat papillary collecting while in vivo data suggests that diuretics such as furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide alter inner medulla collecting duct (imcd) cell electrolyte this has not been confirmed by in vivo studies nor have the mechanisms been this study evaluated the direct effect of these diuretics as well as amiloride on sodium and chloride unidirectional permeability in the isolated perfused rat in the absence of the permeability of sodium was lower than that of chloride +/- compared with +/- although both were relatively impermeable when compared to furosemide (10(-4)) and hydrochlorothiazide (10(-3)) both increased the diffusional permeability of chloride by approximately 30% +/- to +/- p < and +/- to +/- p < sodium permeability was inhibition of k+-atpase by ouabain or cooling (4 degrees c) inhibited basal sodium but not chloride permeability while a maximal antidiuretic avp concentration did not alter sodium or chloride increasing the lumen and bath sodium chloride concentration from 150 to 300 and 600 mm significantly increased both sodium and particularly chloride in amiloride (10(-4)) significantly reduced both sodium and chloride these studies support a direct effect of furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide on the imcd and suggest that their in vivo effect is primarily mediated by facilitating the passive movement of chloride into the lumen via a favourable electrochemical these results also demonstrate that amiloride inhibits both sodium and chloride unidirectional permeability by mechanisms separate to that of the sulphonamide-related
