the ototoxicity of extrapolation and relevance of short-duration animal exposure inhalation exposure to high concentrations of 2-trichloroethylene (tce) has been shown to damage hearing in the mid-frequency range in the the present study directly evaluated the adequacy of short-term exposures to tce for predicting the neurotoxicity produced by longer duration adult male long-evans rats (n = 10-12 per group) were exposed to tce via inhalation (whole body) in 1-m3 stainless steel flow-through chambers for 6 5 the following exposures were 1 day (4000-8000 1 week (1000-4000 4 weeks (800-3200 and 13 weeks (800-3200 air-only exposed animals served as auditory thresholds were determined for a 16-khz tone 3-5 weeks after exposure using reflex modification results replicated previous findings of a hearing loss at 16 khz for all exposure the db15 concentrations (concentration that increases thresholds by 15 db) for 16-khz thresholds were and 2160 ppm for the 4-week and 13-week these data demonstrate that the ototoxicity of tce was less than that predicted by a strict concentration x time these data also demonstrate that simple models of extrapolation c x t = law) overestimate the potency of tce when extrapolating from short-duration to longer-duration these data suggest relative to ambient or occupational the ototoxicity of tce in the rat is a high-concentration
effect of elevated serum prolactin concentrations on the immunophenotype of human mitogen-induced proliferation and phagocytic activity of polymorphonuclear it has been suggested that the immune system is an important target tissue of prolactin we therefore investigated several immune parameters in nine patients with chronically elevated serum prolactin the immunophenotype of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation and phagocytic activity of polymorphonuclear cells were determined under high serum prolactin levels and 2 weeks after treatment with dopamine an increased cd4/cd8 ratio in the hyperprolactinaemic patients could be detected compared with healthy control which remained high after treatment and did not seem to correlate with serum prolactin peripheral blood b lymphocytes showed an increased expression of cd69 in the treated group but not in untreated patients compared with healthy control interleukin 2 transferrin receptor or hla-dr expression of cd4 or cd8 as well as oxidative burst and phagocytic activity of were not affected in the patients with lymphocyte transformation response to phytohaemagglutinin in vitro was found not to be influenced by elevated prolactin levels except at the highest mitogen concentration these data together with previous reports suggest although prl is required for lymphocyte maturation to achieve normal immune elevated prl levels do not lead to an of the immune system in
evidence for association between the class i subset of the insulin gene minisatellite (iddm2 locus) and iddm in the japanese although the shortest (class i) minisatellite variable number of tandem repeats [vntr]) alleles in the region of the insulin gene are positively associated with iddm in the majority of japanese are homozygous for class i we determined the exact in number of repeat units of class i alleles in japanese the distribution of class i alleles in japanese was with peaks located at and 44 the shortest component 1s [25-38 rus]) alleles were significantly increased in the iddm group compared with the control group (54 p = the 1s/1s genotype was significantly increased in the iddm patients (34 p = relative risk the transmission disequilibrium test of japanese families with 1s/1m or 1s/1l heterozygous parents confirmed the association of 1s 17 alleles of 1s and 6 alleles of 1m (39-41 rus) or 1l (42-44 rus) were transmitted to affected offspring (p = in we found tight linkage of 1s with allele 9 of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene microsatellite and allele (-) of the igf-ii gene apa i but neither 9 nor (-) alleles were significantly associated with the present study suggests that a class i subset may have a role in iddm susceptibility in it was revealed that the difference between 1s alleles and 1m or 1l alleles is almost consistently characterized by a sequence variation generated by deletion of two copies of an acaggggtcc cgggg repeat implying that sequence variation of class i alleles may influence disease
effect of fetal movement on the amniotic fluid index in diamniotic twin fetal movement changes the size and location of amniotic fluid pockets during measurement of the amniotic fluid in singleton the effect of redistributing the fixed intrauterine fluid volume on the amniotic fluid index is clinically in this we tested the hypothesis that the index in twin pregnancies is unaffected by fetal a single examiner prospectively determined the amniotic fluid index before and after three discrete episodes of movement by both fetuses of 82 diamniotic twin pregnancies referred for obstetric sonograms between 20 and 38 menstrual a reliable blinded examiner provided a second post-movement measurement as a data were analyzed by the paired the mean change in the amniotic fluid index after fetal movement was +/- cm and +/- cm for post-movement determinations by the same and blinded respectively (p < interobserver variation was intraobserver variation was cm for the first examiner and cm for the second interobserver and intraobserver variation can account for the observed change in the amniotic fluid index following movement of both diamniotic
different racemization ratios in dentin from different locations within a it has been reported that the amount of d-aspartic acid in dentin is highly correlated with further studies are necessary to determine the details of this we quantitatively determined l- and d-aspartic acids in and from the data calculated the d/l we did not find any statistically significant difference in the d/l ratio between the same type of left and right teeth from the same and between the vestibular and lingual sides of the root the d/l ratio was significantly higher on the lingual side than on the labial side of the although the d/l ratio in young subjects was comparatively high in the tooth crown and decreased toward the apex of the we did not always observe such a tendency in middle- to advanced-age these results indicate that the ratio of d/l aspartic acid in dentin varies between the lingual side and vestibular side of the crown it appears that the racemization rate of aspartic acid is not uniform but differs with the region of the and may be affected by differences in factors such as
measurement of bilirubin by hplc in bovine plasma--a comparison with the conventional application of a hplc-technique according to muraca & blanckaert (1983) for accurate determination of the relative amounts of unconjugated bilirubin and its sugar mono- and diconjugates in bovine plasma is described and the results are compared with those of the conventional the diazo-assay yielded values for total and unconjugated bilirubin which were considerably higher than those obtained by the this is probably due to unidentified diazo-positive compounds distinct from the direct-reacting fraction in the diazo-assay showed little or no agreement with the fraction of total ester conjugates determined by results indicate that the diagnostical value of bilirubin subfractioning by the diazo-method as a liver function test in cattle must be

alpha 2-macroglobulin synthesis by the human monocytic cell line thp-1 is differentiation human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2m) is a broad spectrum proteinase inhibitor and cytokine carrier synthesized by a number of cell types including monocytes and in this we report on the expression of alpha 2m by thp-1 this monocytic cell line can be differentiated into a macrophage-like phenotype by treatment with interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate alpha 2m was synthesized by thp-1 cells at a rate of 75 ng/10(6) cells/24 as determined by western blot after treating the cells with 500 u/ml of ifn-gamma or with 100 ng/ml the synthesis rate increased to 219 ng/10(6) cells/24 h and to 179 ng/10(6) cells/24 the same agents also increased alpha 2m as determined by northern blot when the alpha 2m receptor receptor associated protein was included in the thp-1 the amount of alpha 2m recovered in the conditioned medium this result suggests that thp-1-secreted proteinases react with secreted alpha 2m and that the resulting complexes are catabolized by the alpha 2m which is also called low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein we conclude that alpha 2m synthesis by thp-1 cells depends on the state of cellular reaction of alpha 2m with secreted proteinases may have minimized previous estimates of the rate of synthesis of alpha 2m by certain cells in
conformational characterization of peptides rich in the cycloaliphatic c glycine 1-aminocyclononane-1-carboxylic a series of n- and monodispersed homo-oligopeptides (to the pentamer level) from the cycloaliphatic c glycine 1-aminocyclononane-1-carboxylic acid (ac9c) and two ala/ac9c tripeptides have been synthesized by solution methods and fully the conformational preferences of all the model peptides were determined in deuterochloroform solution by ft-ir absorption and the molecular structures of the amino acid derivatives mciac-ac9c-oh and the dipeptide the tetrapeptide and the pentapeptide z-(ac9c)5-otbu were determined in the crystal state by x-ray based on this the average geometry and the preferred conformation for the cyclononyl moiety of the ac9c residue have been the backbone conformational data are strongly in favour of the conclusion that the ac9c residue is a strong beta-turn and helix a comparison with the structural propensity of alpha-aminoisobutyric the prototype of c and the other extensively investigated members of the family of 1-aminocycloalkane-1-carboxylic acids with n = 3-8) is made and the implications for the use of the ac9c residue in conformationally constrained analogues of bioactive peptides are briefly
flow characteristics and required control algorithm of an implantable centrifugal left ventricular assist as the clinical application of lvads has attempts have been made to develop less more durable and efficient implantable devices using rotary blood since chronic circulatory support with implantable continuous-flow lvads will be established in the near we need to determine the flow characteristics through an implantable continuous-flow this study describes the flow characteristics through an implantable centrifugal blood pump as a left ventricular assist device (lvad) to obtain a simple non-invasive algorithm to control its assist flow rate a prototype of the completely seal-less and pivot bearing-supported centrifugal blood pump was implanted into two bypassing from the left ventricle to the descending device motor flow and aortic blood pressure were monitored the flow patterns revealed forward flow in ventricular systole and backward flow in as the pump speed an end-diastolic notch became evident in the flow although the flow rate (q [l/min]) and rotational speed (r [rpm]) had a linear correlation (q = - r = this linearity was altered after the end-diastolic notch was the end-diastolic notch is considered to be a sign of the sucking phenomenon of the centrifugal although the consumed current (i [a]) and flow rate had a linear correlation (i = + r = this linearity also changed after the end-diastolic notch was based upon the above we propose a simple algorithm to maintain submaximal flow without inducing to maintain the submaximal flow rate without measuring flow the sucking point is determined by monitoring consumed current according to gradual increases in
relative exercise intensity of long-distance marching (120 km in 4 days) in 153 subjects aged 69-87 the aim of this study was to determine the relative exercise intensity (oxygen uptake during the march/maximal oxygen vo2march/vo2max) during a long-distance march in subjects or over 70 years of the effect of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases on the relative exercise intensity was one hundred and fifty-three 97 men aged years and 56 women aged years who completed the 1993 nijmegen day long-distance march (30 km x day(-1) on 4 consecutive days) participated in the oxygen uptake (vo2) during walking at different velocities (v) was measured in a subgroup of nine men and nine selected randomly from the population under with these regression equations describing the relationship between vo2 and v were vo2march was estimated with the obtained regression equations from an average of the v(march) measured in all vo2max was determined using incremental cycle ergometry in all vo2march was ml x kg(-1) x min(-1) in men and ml x kg x min(-1) in women at a mean v of 5 km x h(-1) in both this corresponded to 52% of vo2max in men and 63% in in both sexes subjects with cardiovascular and/or pulmonary diseases walked at a slower v and thus lower vo2march compared to subjects without these due to the lower vo2max in subjects with these diseases there was no difference in the relative exercise intensity between the a multiple linear regression analysis showed that and not age on the prevalence of cardiovascular and/or pulmonary that vo2max was the most important predictor of the variance in self-selected this study demonstrates that these active people aged over 70 years could maintain a high relative exercise intensity during endurance walking on 4 subsequent it shows that the relative exercise intensity of marching is within the range recommended for improving fitness and reducing the risk of cardiovascular these results demonstrate that vo2max has a more important influence on performance than does age or chronic diseases in active elderly

and characterization of the major autolysin from pseudomonas the major (26 kda) autolysin from pseudomonas aeruginosa was purified to apparent homogeneity by a combination of preparative and dye-ligand this purification was facilitated by the development of a spot-assay that involved the spotting and subsequent incubation of autolysin samples on polyacrylamide gels containing the pl of the 26-kda autolysin was determined to be between and 4 and disulfide bonds within the enzyme were essential for the autolysin catalyzed the release of reducing sugars from the peptidoglycans of pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli indicating it to be a it was ineffective at hydrolysing the peptidoglycan from gram-positive bacteria and the o-acetylated peptidoglycans from either proteus mirabilis or staphylococcus the n-terminal sequence of the purified autolysin was determined to be the 26-kda autolysin together with a 29-kda autolysin was determined to be secreted into the medium by a mechanism that involves the production and release of surface membrane vesicles during normal but the enzymes were not found free and active in culture broth
polyketide synthase gene pksm from aspergillus terreus expressed during growth the polyketide synthase gene pksm was detected in the genomic dna library of aspergillus terreus by hybridization with the 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase (6-msas) gene of penicillium patulum as a 9524 bp of the cloned dna were sequenced and a kb open reading frame was a single intron (62 bp) was identified in the conserved two transcription start points were determined within the region at 50 and 72 (major) bp upstream from the putative translation initiation codon the conserved active site motifs for ketoreductase and acyl carrier protein were found within the predicted polypeptide consisting of 1803 amino unlike the patulum 6-msas the transcription of pksm from terreus was observed in the middle of the vegetative growth
dynamic changes in spontaneous intracellular free calcium oscillations and their relationship to prolactin gene expression in primary cytosolic calcium plays a critical role in the control of a number of including that of the pituitary hormone cells that secrete this termed display spontaneous oscillations of intracellular free calcium ([ca2+]i) that are positively correlated to prl the precise contribution of calcium signaling to the expression of any gene including prl has remained obscure owing to the requirement for and lack of a strategy for monitoring both of these dynamic variables (gene expression and [ca2+]i oscillations) in the same living in the present we overcame this technical limitation by making real-time measurements of prl gene expression in primary rat mammotropes previously subjected to [ca2+]i determinations by digital imaging fluorescence microscopy of our results showed that the majority of mammotropes (75%) exhibited distinct oscillatory behaviors that could be subgrouped on the basis of frequency/amplitude of [ca2+]i whereas the remainder (25%) were quiescent most mammotropes displayed spontaneous transitions between oscillatory and quiescent states over the course of several as a consequence of this oscillatory there was not a positive correlation between [ca2+]i dynamics and gene expression at any point in as would be predicted by studies with entire populations of the relationship was distinctly suggesting that dynamic changes in prl gene expression may be regulated by temporally dissociated transitions between quiescent and oscillatory
determination of cis-thymine glycol in dna by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with selected ion recording and multiple reaction a novel method for the determination of cis-thymine glycol in dna has been using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with selected ion recording or multiple reaction the procedure involves acidic hydrolysis of dna in the presence of the internal standard cis-[2h3]thymine followed by derivatisation with the method was validated on dna that had been oxidatively modified in vitro by radiation and was then applied to determine cis-thymine glycol in human placental background levels of ng cis-thymine glycol/mg dna were observed in the human
structure of the vdelta domain of a human gammadelta t-cell antigen antigen recognition by t lymphocytes is mediated by cell-surface glycoproteins known as t-cell antigen receptors these are composed of alpha and or gamma and polypeptide chains with variable (v) and constant (c) in contrast to alphabeta which recognize antigen only as peptide fragments bound to molecules of the major histocompatibility complex gammadelta tcrs appear to recognize proteins without antigen and to recognize mhc molecules independently of the bound small phosphate-containing non-peptide compounds have also been identified as ligands for certain gammadelta t these studies indicate that antigen recognition by gammadelta tcrs may be fundamentally different from that by alphabeta the three-dimensional structures of several alphabeta tcrs and tcr and their complexes with peptide-mhc or have been here we report the crystal structure of the vdelta domain of a human gammadelta tcr at a a comparison with antibody and alphabeta tcr v domains reveals that the framework structure of vdelta more closely resembles that of vh than of vbeta or vl (where h and l refer to heavy and light whereas the relative positions and conformations of its complementarity-determining regions (cdrs) share features of both valpha and these results provide the first direct evidence that gammadelta tcrs are structurally distinct from alphabeta tcrs together with the observation that the cdr3 length distribution of tcr delta chains is similar to that of immunoglobulin heavy are consistent with functional studies suggesting that recognition of certain antigens by gammadelta tcrs may resemble antigen recognition by
ige secretion is attenuated by an inhibitor of proteolytic processing of cd23 (fc the low-affinity ige is up-regulated on interleukin (il)-4-stimulated b cells and with a concomitant increase in the release of soluble fragments of cd23 (scd23) into the medium by proteolytic processing of the surface-bound intact the effect of inhibition of the processing of cd23 on ige production in human and mouse cells and in a mouse model in vivo was cd23 processing to scd23 from rpmi 8866 (a human epstein-barr virus-transformed b cell line) cell membranes was inhibited by a broad-spectrum matrix-metalloprotease with an ic50 of batimastat also inhibited cd23 processing in whole rpmi 8866 cells as well as in il-4-stimulated purified human monocytes with similar batimastat inhibited ige production from il-4/anti-cd40-stimulated human tonsil b cells as well as mouse splenic b cells in a manner consistent with inhibition of cd23 release of soluble fragments of cd23 in the cell supernatants of tonsil b cells was inhibited over the concentration range of 1-10 microm batimastat and intact cell surface cd23 was increased on mouse splenic b cells in the presence of these concentrations of ige production of il-4-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also blocked by 1-10 microm again with comparable inhibition of scd23 release over the same concentration in a mouse model of ige batimastat inhibited ige production in response to ovalbumin challenge as determined by serum ige taken the data support a role of cd23 in ige production and point to cd23 processing to scd23 as a therapeutically relevant control point in the regulation of ige
elevated circulating calcitonin gene-related peptide in umbilical cord and infant blood associated with maternal and neonatal sepsis and the role of the sensory neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp) was studied in preterm and term neonates with sepsis and cgrp levels in blood were measured by the identity of immunoreactive cgrp (ircgrp) in adult and infant human blood was confirmed by reverse cgrp levels were analyzed in a total of 189 samples (95 from cord blood and 94 from the gestational ages ranged from 24 to 43 and the birth weights ranged from 520 to 4445 cord samples were collected immediately after delivery and infant blood samples were collected within 12 h of samples were and the data were assigned to groups after determination of cgrp there was a weight- and gestation-dependent increase in ircgrp in the newborn the direct correlation of circulating cgrp with ascending birth weight and gestation may have significance in the development of the infants with and without certain complications were grouped in 500-g cgrp levels in cord blood were significantly elevated when certain stressful situations existed in the these included culture-positive placental and severe there was a similar elevation in cgrp in patient blood in infants with culture-positive sepsis and/or shock with blood pressure <2 sd from the mean for corresponding cgrp levels did not differ between male and female infants and did not appear to be influenced by type of delivery (vaginal versus cesarean there was no significant difference in cgrp level between cord and patient blood in preterm but at term gestation cord blood levels were slightly higher than those in the patient these results suggest that inflammation and hemodynamic imbalance shock) are associated with increased in cgrp levels in the circulation in future studies will focus on the biologic effects of elevated cgrp during neonatal complications and will examine the utility of cgrp measurement for diagnosis and treatment of disease in preterm
