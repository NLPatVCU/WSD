functional recovery and timing of hospital discharge after primary total hip early discharge programmes in hospitals are encouraged to increase financial efficiency and bed but standards of clinical care must not be criteria for safe hospital discharge must be established and objective data are needed to assess how rapidly patients can achieve these discharge a prospective study was performed on 65 patients (mean age = 71 years) scheduled for primary total hip arthroplasty the modified barthel index (mbi) was measured pre-operatively and postoperatively at set intervals to asses recovery of function after a score of 90 out of a possible 100 was used as a discharge criterion and indicated that the patient was functionally independent for safe hospital in a combined score for thigh flexion and extension isokinetic peak strength was recorded for each patient before and after the number and nature of comorbidities and complications were also the length of hospital stay in this sample varied from 5 to 39 the mbi scores increased rapidly between days 3 and then began to plateau from day 8 based on the 58% of patients were fit for discharge at or before day the remainder were fit for discharge from day 10 onwards (mean = the latter group who required an extended hospital stay were older (p = had more identified comorbidities (p = and were weaker in their hip musculature prior to surgery (p = compared to those who were discharged by day a logistic regression analysis indicated that the pre-operative mbi score and hip strength score were strong predictors of timing for hospital a clinical pathway with functional milestones laid out over 8 days would be an appropriate criterion for the discharge of the majority of approximately 40% of the patients presented in this study required a longer hospital stay before the criteria for safe discharge could be these patients can be identified pre-operatively by screening their mbi and composite hip strength
dependence and perceived difficulty in daily activities in community-living stroke survivors 2 years after a study of instrumental background and there is a need for better understanding of the structure of instruments for functional outcome assessment after discharge from one purpose of the study was to contribute to the analysis of instrumental another purpose was to compare disability in stroke patients within the younger age range 2 years after onset of stroke with that at discharge with respect to both dependence and perceived difficulty and to extend the assessments with instrumental we studied 68 stroke survivors aged 18 to 71 years at onset (59% aged <55 years) by means of interviews in their using activities from the functional independence measure (fim) and instrumental activity measure (iam) for ratings of dependence and perceived rasch analysis was used to construct calibrated linear measures and to evaluate the level of acceptable models for comparison of dependence between discharge and follow-up were found for the physical and the social-cognitive items in personal care and social-cognitive items showed an increased level of dependence at follow-up compared with at a combination of physical activities from fim and iam also gave acceptable models for both dependence and perceived and the hierarchical orders of activities are in there was agreement between the ratings of dependence and perceived but with some men found it harder to be independent in such instrumental activities as cooking and cleaning than the opposite was true for small-scale shopping and locomotion subjects aged > or =55 years had slightly higher level of dependence and perceived difficulty in iam activities than those below that changes in the hierarchical order of activities should be taken into account in follow-up differences in the environment between hospital and as well as differences in support and might explain the relatively larger degree of dependence at follow-up compared with at discharge and indicate the need for further rehabilitation instrumental activities could be combined with fim activities in a for individual ratings of both dependence and perceived difficulty may provide further insight into the disablement

interest in alternative birth settings in the aim of this study was to examine the extent of wishes for and realised choices of alternative and conventional birth care in finland based on survey and registry a population-based national survey to 3000 women of reproductive age and 400 men aged 18-24 and 40-44 in finland and a cross-sectional analysis of all childbirths in 1990 1995 based on the national medical birth registry in the survey 69% of women and 66% of men chose conventional hospital birth as their preferred an early discharge birth was chosen by 14% of women and 18% of men and home birth by 6% of women and 3% of childless respondents were more likely than parents to choose an alternative other than conventional hospital yet 16% of mothers and 14% of fathers would choose either home birth or early discharge from hospital in a future the expressed interest in alternatives to conventional hospital care was far greater than what occurs in in the mbr data 99% of births were conventional hospital were planned homebirths and % early discharge the study shows a discrepancy between expressed interests and actually realised choices of birth the majority of female and male survey respondents would choose conventional hospital care for the fact that even some women who had earlier birth experience preferred some form of alternative to the conventional hospital birth should be taken as a sign of women wanting choices in birth
a survey of patient education through a telephone the discharge call service (dcs) was instituted with 206 patients discharged from two medical-surgical nursing the purposes of the survey were to (1) improve patient outcomes by assessing patient perceptions of their recuperation progress after (2) assess the post discharge educational (3) provide additional information concerning or medications requested by the and (4) direct patients to the appropriate medical center or community resource as needed for further assistance or in patients believed their medical status was progressing as nevertheless almost half of the patients surveyed needed additional information or specific directions concerning their findings suggest the dcs is an effective strategy to enhance the ability for self-care after the dcs is also an easily implemented and cost-effective enhancement of hospital patient education and health promotion
