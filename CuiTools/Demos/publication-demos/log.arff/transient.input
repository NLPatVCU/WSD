two distinct low-voltage-activated ca2+ currents contribute to the pacemaker mechanism in cockroach dorsal unpaired median the contribution of ca2+ currents to the endogenous firing properties of cockroach isolated adult dorsal unpaired median neurons was investigated using whole cell patch-clamp technique with 5 mm ca2+ as the charge at least three types of ca2+ a high-voltage-activated ca2+ current and two low-voltage-activated (lva) ca2+ have been found in these this study focused on the lva ca2+ which are suitable candidates in the generation of the slow predepolarization because of their low threshold of the global lva ca2+ current could be dissociated by means of nickel deactivation time constant and voltage dependence of time to tail current amplitude and as transient and maintained lva ca2+ the transient lva ca2+ sensitive to 100 microm was isolated by using a subtraction it was activated at -70 mv and half-inactivated at the inactivation was purely voltage current-clamp experiments performed with 150 microm ni2+ indicated that this current was involved in the initial part of the the maintained lva ca2+ resistant to 100 microm was activated in a range of potential 10 mv more positive than the transient lva ca2+ and its voltage dependence of inactivation displayed a replacing ca2+ with ba2+ in equimolar amount or low internal ca2+ concentration [5 mm acid (bapta) in the pipette] induced a monotonic voltage dependence of inactivation and increased the rate of relaxation of this these effects were mimicked by high internal ca2+ concentration mm ca2+ and no ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl acid in the this demonstrated an unusual ca2+-sensitive inactivation process that varied over a narrow range of ca2+ current-clamp experiments performed under 150 microm with 15 mm external ca2+ concentration (which potentiated the maintained lva current within 30 s of superfusion) or with 5 mm bapta in the pipette demonstrated the participation of this current in the last two-thirds of the slow predepolarizing our findings for the first time in neurosecretory the coexistence of two distinct lva ca2+ which have specialized function in the generation of the pacemaker
neurons sensitive to interaural temporal disparities in the medial part of the ventral nucleus of the lateral the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (vnll) is implicated in processing monaural because its neurons receive input chiefly from the contralateral cochlear we demonstrate here that a region of the vnll contains a distinct population of neurons that process binaural sounds and are sensitive to interaural temporal disparities responses of single neurons were recorded from unanesthetized rabbits by using metal electrodes or micropipettes loaded with dextran tagged with either biotin or a fluorescent reconstructions of recording sites based on a few marks indicated that itd-sensitive neurons were located in a medial region of vnll that has a low density of neurons or in the adjacent reticular in one animal the locations of five itd-sensitive neurons were marked directly by injection of dextrans with different all of these neurons lay in the medial region of the the itd-sensitive neurons of the vnll had characteristic most neurons responded only at the onset of contralaterally or binaurally presented many did not respond to ipsilateral stimulation alone and did not follow dynamic changes in the the presence of itd-sensitive neurons in the vnll that responded only at the onset of tones suggests that this center plays a role in the localization of transient
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (m-csf) augments cytokine induction by lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulation and by bacterial infections in we studied the effects of m-csf on cytokine induction in vivo by lps or by bacterial infection by comparing between the serum cytokine levels of mice administered with and without m-csf at 250 micrograms/kg/day for 3 days significantly augmented serum il-6 level induced by a subsequent injection of 25 micrograms/kg of the augmented il-6-induction was dose-dependent from 50 to 1250 micrograms/kg/day of and required 2- to 3-doses of m-csf at 250 mice primed with m-csf induced il-6 in response to a 5-fold lower dose of and also produced higher levels of il-1 and ifn-gamma than control the priming effect of m-csf was transient and and elicited independently of an injection with intact such as gram-negative escherichia coli and gram-positive staphylococcus aureus also induced il-6 in normal and m-csf administration augmented the induction of these these results showed that m-csf positively regulates lps-dependent and -independent cytokine suggesting a defensive effect against infectious agents through enhanced cytokine
dorsal column but not lateral column transection prevents down-conditioning of h reflex in operant conditioning of the h the electrical analogue of the spinal stretch in freely moving rats is a relatively simple model for studying long-term supraspinal control over spinal cord motivated by food rats can gradually increase or decrease the soleus h this study is the first effort to determine which spinal cord pathways convey the descending influence from supraspinal structures that changes the h in anesthetized sprague-dawley the entire dorsal column which includes the main corticospinal or the right lateral column (lc) was transected by animals recovered quickly and the minimal transient effects of transection on the right soleus h reflex disappeared within 16 beginning at least 18 days after 12 rats were exposed to the hrdown-conditioning in which reward was given when the h reflex of the right soleus muscle was below a criterion in seven lc rats exposed to the hrdown the h reflex fell to 71 +/- 8% (mean +/- se) of its initial in six of the conditioning was successful decrease to < or = these results were comparable with those previously obtained from normal in in five dc rats exposed to the hrdown the h reflex at the end of exposure was 106 +/- 12% of its initial in none of these rats was hrdown-conditioning dc rats differed significantly from normal and lc rats in both final h reflex values and number in five dc and three lc rats that continued under control conditions over 30-78 the h reflex at the end of the period was 98 +/- 4% and 100 +/- of its initial indicating that dc or lc transection itself did not lead to gradual increase or decrease in the h the results indicate that the containing the main corticospinal is essential for whereas the ipsilateral containing the main and reticulospinal is not combined with the known muscular specificity of these results suggest that the main corticospinal tract is essential for the dc ascending tract might also be the respective roles of the dc descending and ascending and transection effects on hrup-conditioning and on the maintenance of both hrup- and hrdown-conditioning after they have remain to be
cerebral vasomotor changes in the transient syndrome of headache with neurologic deficits and csf lymphocytosis we report two patients with the recently described transient syndrome of headache with neurologic deficits and csf lymphocytosis transcranial doppler sonography performed during and after attacks of handl showed asymmetrical decreases or increases in blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral accompanied by increases or decreases in pulsatility suggesting fluctuations of arteriolar the findings demonstrate focal vasomotor disturbances that link the transient headaches and deficits of handl with attacks of
menstrual bleeding in a female infant with congenital adrenal altered maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian vaginal bleeding during the neonatal period is commonly related to the withdrawal of maternal vaginal bleeding has also been reported in female infants with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and has been proposed to be due to a treatment-induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian we report a female infant with the salt-losing form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase who had the onset of vaginal bleeding at 3 months of adrenal steroid suppression had been achieved by weeks of at the time of imaging studies revealed an enlarged right ovary with a dominant 3-cm cyst and additional small cysts that had not been seen on the newborn the uterus was enlarged and three weeks later (1 week after the cessation of repeat ultrasound demonstrated a marked decrease in the size of the right and the dominant cyst was no longer the patient had a heightened fsh response to gnrh and elevated levels of estradiol for at 5 months of no further episodes of sustained vaginal bleeding were repeat hormonal levels were and pelvic sonogram demonstrated no evidence of the findings in our patient suggest that a decline in adrenal androgens after glucocorticoid treatment resulted in an increase in gonadotropin which then triggered a transient and augmented end-organ response we suggest that our hormonal findings may reflect a delay in the timely development of the negative restraint by sex steroids on gonadotropins that is normally observed in
effects of nitroprusside and nicorandil on catecholamine secretion and calcium mobilization in cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin the effects of nitroprusside and nicorandil on catecholamine secretion and free intracellular ca2+ ([ca2+]i) mobilization in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were studied to evaluate the role of the nitric oxide (no)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cgmp) pathway in the regulation of a [ca2+]i-dependent secretory these effects were compared with those of a typical voltage-dependent ca2+ channel carbachol produced a rapid increase followed by a sustained increase of [ca2+]i (ca2+ transient) in cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin both nitroprusside and nicorandil accelerated the decrease in [ca2+]i without changing the peak values of the initial [ca2+]i increase of ca2+ these did not affect carbachol-induced catecholamine suggesting that secretion is related to the initial [ca2+]i increase and not to a late sustained [ca2+]i nifedipine reduced the peak and duration of carbachol-induced [ca2+]i increases and decreased the secretion of diethylamine/no an no and dibutyryl-cgmp produced similar changes in ca2+ transient and did not alter catecholamine suggesting that the effects of nitroprusside and nicorandil were mediated by the no/cgmp these results indicated that the pattern of ca2+ especially the initial increase in is important in secretion of
changes in tcpco2 regarding pulmonary mechanics due to pneumotachometer dead space in ventilated the aim of this study was to analyze the effect of added dead space on paco2 after application of a pneumotachometer during the measurement of pulmonary the study was based on 24 observations of tcpco2 changes during the measurement of pulmonary function in 9 newborns subjected to mechanical all newborns remained stable during the 23 minutes of the the introduction of a low dead space pneumotachometer ml) for 10 minutes led to an increase in tcpco2 of +/- mm from +/- to +/- pulmonary mechanics indexes that correlated with the percentage of co2 increase were peak inspiratory flow and expiratory time/time when the pneumotachometer was tcpco2 fell but remained +/- mm hg above basal final tcpco2 tended to relate negatively with the minute we conclude that this transient increase in paco2 should be born in mind in neonates with a high basal level and can be prevented by maintaining a long expiratory time and a high minute
unexpected and differential effects of cl- channel blockers on the and k+ implications for the study of the i(to2) the k+ channel is thought to underlie the ca(2+)-insensitive transient outward current (i(to1)) in ventricular myocytes of canine and human heart and to contribute to the i(to1) in rat it has been suggested that there is a second component of the transient outward current in some species that is contributed by a ca(2+)-activated cl- current (known as the evidence for the existence of the i(to2) current is in on the pharmacological effects of various cl- channel to test for possible interactions between these compounds and the effect of several different cl- channel blockers on the channel was the fenamates (niflumic and flufenamic acid) were found to have large effects on the position of the steady state inactivation curve of the the disulfonic stilbenes (dids and sits) had markedly different effects and were found to greatly reduce the rate of recovery from inactivation of the channel without large changes in the position of the activation and steady state inactivation both classes of drugs produced an apparent blockade of the channel under some recording the closely related channel was found to be markedly less sensitive to these caffeine was found to block both the and channels to a similar these nonspecific drug effects have implications for the study of the two components of the transient outward current and suggest that purely pharmacological criteria cannot be used to define the physiological role of
metabolic and hemodynamic effects of peptide leukotriene c4 and d4 in the time course of the effects of intravenous or intracoronary administration of peptide leukotrienes on metabolic parameters and on systemic and coronary hemodynamics was evaluated in 15 patients with normal coronary peptide leukotriene c4 (2 nmol given as a bolus intravenous injection) induced an early fall (at 2 min) in mean arterial pressure (p < associated with a rise in heart rate (p < and in plasma levels of epinephrine (p < and norepinephrine (p < but without significant changes in coronary blood flow or coronary vascular mean arterial heart and epinephrine returned to baseline values 10 min after leukotriene c4 in at 10 min post leukotriene with coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption an increase in coronary vascular resistance (p < and in myocardial oxygen extraction (p < was which returned to baseline values at 20 min post leukotriene peptide leukotriene d4 (3 given in the left coronary artery) induced an early (20 s) and transient fall in mean arterial pressure (p < paralleled by a rise in heart rate and plasma levels of epinephrine and all of which returned to baseline at 10 coronary vascular resistance increased at 10 and 15 min (p < and p < respectively) and myocardial oxygen extraction at 15 min (p < these results suggest that small doses of peptide leukotrienes induce both an early and transient fall in mean arterial pressure associated with secondary sympathoadrenergic and a late increase in small coronary arteriolar
mechanism and kinetics of heterosynaptic depression at a cerebellar high levels of activity at a synapse can lead to spillover of neurotransmitter from the synaptic this extrasynaptic neurotransmitter can diffuse to neighboring synapses and modulate transmission via presynaptic we studied such modulation at the synapse between granule cells and purkinje cells in rat cerebellar brief tetanic stimulation of granule cell parallel fibers activated inhibitory leading to a transient elevation of extracellular which in turn caused a short-lived heterosynaptic depression of the parallel fiber to purkinje cell fluorometric calcium measurements revealed that this synaptic inhibition was associated with a decrease in presynaptic calcium heterosynaptic inhibition of synaptic currents and calcium influx was eliminated by antagonists of the gabab the magnitude and time course of the depression of calcium influx were mimicked by the rapid release of an estimated 10 microm gaba using the technique of flash we found that inhibition of presynaptic calcium influx peaked within 300 msec and decayed in <3 sec at 32 degrees these results indicate that presynaptic gabab receptors can sense extrasynaptic gaba increases of several micromolar and that they rapidly regulate the release of neurotransmitter primarily by modulating voltage-gated calcium

retinal axon growth cone responses to different environmental cues are mediated by different second-messenger numerous studies have shown that the developing tip of a the growth can respond to environmental cues with behaviors such as guidance or to assess whether a given cell type can use more than one second-messenger pathway for a single we compared the influence of two well-characterized guidance cues on growth cones of chick temporal retinal ganglion the first cue was the repulsive activity derived from the posterior optic tectum and the second was the collapse-inducing activity derived from oligodendrocytes known as p-membranes caused permanent growth cone collapse with no recovery after several while ni35 caused transient collapse followed by recovery after about 10 the p-membrane-induced collapse was found to be ca2+ as shown using the ca2+-sensitive dye fura-2 and by the persistence of collapse in ca2+-free a blocker of the ryanodine had only a minor effect on the collapse frequency caused by in the ni35-induced collapse was clearly ca2+ [ca2+]i increased sevenfold preceding and both dantrolene and antibodies against ni35 significantly reduced both the ca2+ increase and the collapse even in a single cell growth cone collapse induced by two different signals can be mediated by two different second-messenger
interference of bad (bcl-xl/bcl-2-associated death promoter)-induced apoptosis in mammalian cells by 14-3-3 isoforms and apoptosis and survival of diverse cell types are under hormonal but intracellular mechanisms regulating cell death are the bcl-2/ced-9 family of proteins contains conserved bcl-2 homology regions that mediate the formation of homo- or heterodimers important for enhancing or suppressing unlike most other members of the bcl-2 bad (bcl-xl/bcl-2 associated death a death has no c-terminal transmembrane domain for targeting to the outer mitochondrial membrane and nuclear we hypothesized that in addition to binding bcl-xl and may interact with proteins outside the bcl-2 using the yeast two-hybrid system to search for bad-binding proteins in an ovarian fusion cdna we identified multiple cdna clones encoding different isoforms of a group of evolutionally conserved proteins essential for signal transduction and cell cycle point mutation of bad in one but not the other putative binding site found in diverse 14-3-3 interacting proteins abolished the interaction between bad and 14-3-3 without affecting interactions between bad and because the s137a bad mutant presumably resembles an underphosphorylated form of we used this mutant to screen for additional bad-interacting proteins in the yeast two-hybrid a nerve growth factor-induced neurite extension factor and member of the calcium-binding s-100 protein interacted strongly with the mutant bad but less effectively with the wild type in chinese hamster ovary (cho) transient expression of wild type bad or its mutants increased apoptotic cell which was blocked by cotransfection with the baculovirus-derived cysteine protease cotransfection with 14-3-3 suppressed apoptosis induced by wild type or the s113a mutant bad but not by the s137a mutant incapable of binding cotransfection with p11 attenuated the proapoptotic effect of both wild type bad and the s137a for both 14-3-3 and direct binding to bad was also demonstrated in these results suggest that both 14-3-3 and p11 may function as bad-binding proteins to dampen its apoptotic because the 14-3-3 family of proteins could interact with key signaling proteins including raf-1 protein kinase and phosphatidyl inositol 3 whereas p11 is an early response gene induced by the neuronal survival nerve growth the present findings suggest that bad plays an important role in mediating communication between different signal transduction pathways regulated by hormonal signals and the apoptotic mechanism controlled by bcl-2 family
dna methylation accounts for the inhibition of collagen vi expression in transformed the expression of collagen an adhesive glycoprotein of the extracellular is completely inhibited in virally transformed fibroblasts and in many cell lines derived from spontaneous mesenchymal here we present evidence that dna methylation plays an important role in this (a) the mrna level for dna methyltransferase is highly increased in simian virus 40 (sv40)-transformed fibroblasts compared with normal cells and this increase correlates with the decrease of the mrna level for collagen (b) methylation of the alpha2(vi) collagen promoter in vitro abolishes promoter activity in a transient transfection (c) genomic sequencing reveals extensive methylation of the promoter region in sv40-transformed but virtually no methylation of the corresponding region in normal increased methylation is also observed in a rhabdomyosarcoma cell (d) two of the cis-acting elements of the alpha2(vi) collagen promoter lose their affinity for transcription factor ap2 when methylated in vitro as demonstrated by gel retardation dna methylation is therefore involved in the silencing of the alpha2(vi) collagen it seems likely that the same mechanism is also responsible for the repression of other transformation-sensitive

hsp27 as a switch between differentiation and apoptosis in murine embryonic stem small stress proteins are developmentally regulated and linked to cell growth and the early phase of murine embryonic stem (es) cell characterized by a gradual growth is accompanied with hsp27 transient this differentiation process also correlated with changes in hsp27 phosphorylation and the role of hsp27 was investigated in es clones stably transfected with murine or human hsp27 placed in sense or antisense several clones were obtained that either underexpressed endogenous murine hsp27 or overexpressed murine or human maintained these clones showed similar growth we report here that hsp27 constitutive overexpression enhanced the differentiation-mediated decreased rate of es cell proliferation but did not alter morphological in hsp27 which attenuated cell growth induced differentiation abortion because of an overall cell death by we showed that hsp27 interfered with cell death probably because of its ability to modulate intracellular hsp27 accumulation during es cell differentiation was also correlated with an increase in which was attenuated by hsp27 hsp27 transient expression seems essential for preventing differentiating es cells from undergoing a switch that may be redox
13c- and 15n-labeled peptide substrates as mechanistic probes of the carboxamide moiety that links the carbohydrate and protein moieties in n-linked glycoproteins has been unambiguously determined to arise intact from asparagine by the use of chemically synthesized 15n]asn-leu-thr-nh2 as an oligosaccharyltransferase (ost) bz-[4-13c]asn-leu-thr-nh2 was also synthesized and used to evaluate a proposed mechanism of ost catalysis similar to that of glutamine-dependent amidotransferases using 15nh4oac as a potential external analysis of nmr and ms spectra of the isotopically labeled peptides and the resulting biosynthesized glycopeptides indicates that free 15nh3 is not lost from the doubly labeled substrate during catalysis nor can exogenous 15nh3 intercept any of several postulated enzyme-bound these results indicate that ost-catalyzed glycosylation does not follow a mechanism involving the transient generation of exchangeable in contrast to several glutamine-dependent ost catalysis does not lead to transient scission of the asparagine beta-carboxamide c-n together with previously published these data argue against nucleophilic activation of the asparagine beta-carboxamide moiety being the underlying chemical mechanism for ost-catalyzed glycosylation of

hypoxia-induced inhibition of calcium channels in guinea-pig taenia caeci smooth muscle the effects of hypoxia on whole-cell current in single smooth muscle cells and on a high k(+)-induced contraction of strips of the guinea-pig taenia caeci were in physiological salt solution (pss) and k(+)-based pipette hypoxia (po2 = 20 mmhg) reversibly inhibited both the inward ca2+ current (ica) and outward ca(2+)-activated k+ current (ik(ca)) components of the whole-cell in pss and cs(+)-based pipette hypoxia reversibly suppressed ica by 30 +/- 5% at 0 when ba2+ was used as a charge the iba was suppressed by hypoxia in a potential-dependent with the maximum of 40 +/- 7% at +10 alterations of concentrations of gdb beta s or atp in the pipette solution did not change the inhibitory effects of hypoxia on ica and in pss with 2 mm cacl2 replaced by hypoxia did not affect the ca2+ influx-independent potassium in cells voltage clamped at -20 mv hypoxia reversibly inhibited the spontaneous transient outward the response of high k(+)-contracted taenia caeci to hypoxia was composed of an initial rapid relaxation followed by a small transient contraction and slow the transient contraction was blocked by atropine (1-10 while relaxations were unaffected by atropine and guanethidine (10 the results show that hypoxia reversibly inhibits ica and secondarily suppresses ik(ca) due to decreased ca2+ influx through ca2+ it is suggested that inhibition of ica was responsible for the rapid whereas transient contraction may have been due to release of acetylcholine from nerve terminals upon
evidence for the first phase of the reprotonation switch of bacteriorhodopsin from time-resolved photovoltage and flash photolysis experiments on the photoreversal of the the kinetics of the photoreversal reaction of the m-intermediate of bacteriorhodopsin (br) was investigated by time-resolved optical absorption spectroscopy and photovoltage measurements using double-flash excitation (a green flash (532 nm) followed by a blue flash (400 nm) after a variable the sign of the photovoltage and the 1h/2h kinetic isotope effect indicate that the schiff base is reprotonated by a group between the schiff base and the extracellular probably analysis of the kinetic data shows that the charge movement in 150 mm kcl at 12 degrees c is characterized by two components with time constants of approximately 100 ns and approximately 600 which are independent of the delay time between the flashes and the the amplitudes of the fast and slow components depend on the delay and the the slower component starts to contribute to the charge movement only after delays longer than 100 is absent at low and increases in amplitude with a pka of approximately because the proton release group deprotonates after 70-100 micros and has a transient pka of these results suggest the following the fast and the combination of fast and slow components represent photoreversal from two m with the release group protonated and the slow phase of the photoreversal starts from a state with the release group and with the pk of asp85 and is probably due to the restoration of the pk of asp85 to its initial low this provides further evidence for coupling between the of asp85 and the release group and suggests that proton release is the first step in the reprotonation at alkaline ph the amplitude of the electrical signal from the back photoreaction decreases with an apparent pk of without a corresponding decrease in the amount of at neutral ph the movement of the positively charged guanidinium group of arg82 from a position near the release group on the surface to asp85 makes a substantial contribution to the electrical photoreversal above the pk of the release group in the unphotolysed state (approximately arg82 stays near the leading to a corresponding signal

effects of a novel cardiotonic org on force and aequorin light transients in intact ventricular myocardium of the involvement of a cyclic amp-mediated mechanism and myofibrillar responsiveness to ca2+ the action of a novel cardiotonic org 9731 6-dimethoxy-benzo[b]thiophene-2-carboximidamide on intracellular aequorin light transients and isometric contractions was investigated in ventricular trabeculae isolated from the positive inotropic effect of org 9731 at 3 microm and higher (up to mm) was associated with an increase in the amplitude of the intracellular ca2+ but the effect of the compound at and 1 mm was accompanied by a decrease of the the maximum inotropic response to org 9731 was approximately 70% of the maximum response to while the maximum increase in the amplitude of ca2+ transients produced by org 9731 was about 30% of the maximum increase induced by the duration of isometric contractions was prolonged by org 9731 at and 1 with accompanying prolongation of the duration of light the concentration-response curve for the positive inotropic effect of org 9731 was markedly shifted by carbachol (3 being moved to the right and and the maximum response to org 9731 was about 10% of that to isoproterenol in the presence of carbachol abolished the increase in the light transient and the accumulation of adenosine monophosphate (cyclic amp) induced by org these results indicate that org 9731 increases cardiac mainly through the accumulation of cyclic amp up to a concentration of mm and also by increasing the responsiveness of myofibrils to ca2+ ions at mm and higher in association with the attenuation of ca2+ the structure-activity relationship implies that the introduction of a fluorine atom at position 4 of the benzothiophene ring of org attenuated its ca(2+)-sensitizing action but markedly increased the activity of mechanisms dependent on cyclic
patterns of lower esophageal sphincter function associated with gastroesophageal studies in which lower esophageal sphincter and esophageal ph have been monitored simultaneously have challenged the traditional concept that most reflux episodes result from weak steady state lower esophageal sphincter the majority of reflux episodes have occurred during 5-35-second abrupt periods of complete sphincter relaxation usually against a background of normal sphincter this distinctive pattern of which has been named lower esophageal sphincter occurs independently of it depends on vagal pathways and the hindbrain for its patterning and but many of these aspects are still not well control of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation by drug therapy is an attractive future option for management of supraesophageal complications of reflux
prolonged effect of a novel s-nitrosated glyco-amino acid in endothelium-denuded rat femoral potential as a slow release nitric oxide donor the vasodilator properties of a novel s-nitrosated glyco-amino acid (rig200) were investigated in isolated rat femoral arteries and compared with those of the parent s-nitrosothiol s-nitroso-n-acetylpenicillamine spectrophotometric analysis revealed that mm solutions of rig200 decomposed more slowly (half-life (t1/2) = +/- min) than snap (t1/2 = +/- min) in krebs buffer at 24 degrees the rate of decomposition of but not of was significantly reduced by the cu(i) we concluded that the relative stability of rig200 is at least in to its resistance to trace cu(i)-catalyzed nitric oxide (no) generation from snap and rig200 was confirmed by use of an no experiments to investigate the vasodilator effects of rig200 were carried out on isolated femoral arteries taken from adult male wistar rats (400-550 lengths of artery (7-8 mm long) were dissected free and perfused at constant flow rate ml min-1) with krebs vessels were precontracted with phenylephrine +/- microm) and developed pressures of +/- 4 detected upstream by a differential pressure concentration-dependent vasodilator responses to bolus injections of snap or rig200 (10 10(-8)-10(-3) m) made into the perfusate of endothelium-intact vessels were recovering the preinjection pressure in < 20 responses to equivalent bolus injections of snap in endothelium-denuded vessels were also transient but those in response to concentrations of rig200 > 10(-5) m were responses to 10(-3) m rig200 were sustained for periods > 4 sustained vasodilatation was reversed by the no ferrohaemoglobin (10 microm) but was unaffected by the no synthase n omega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (200 indicating involvement of no from a source other than no we suggest that a possible explanation for the prolonged effect of rig200 is retention of the compound by the vascular facilitated by endothelial slow decomposition of rig200 in situ would release sufficient no to maintain a which persists for more than 4 selective retention by damaged vessels could have important therapeutic implications with regard to targeted delivery of restoring protection to areas deprived of endogenous whilst avoiding unwanted
specific interaction of wild-type and truncated mouse n-methylpurine-dna glycosylase with ethenoadenine-containing n-methylpurine-dna glycosylase a ubiquitous dna repair is responsible for the removal of a wide variety of alkylated base lesions in n-alkylpurines and cyclic ethenoadducts of and these some of which are mutagenic and are generated endogenously or by genotoxic agents such as n-alkylnitrosamines and vinyl wild-type mouse expressed from recombinant was purified to near homogeneity for studying its specific interaction with (epsilona-) containing electrophoretic mobility shift assays (emsa) indicated that mpg formed a specific complex with a 50-mer epsilona-containing duplex this complex was shown to be a transient reaction because it could be formed only with the unreacted substrate and contained active enzyme dna footprinting studies confirmed the specific binding of the protein to the epsilona-containing duplex eight nucleotides on the epsilona-containing strand and 16-17 nucleotides in the complementary strand spanning the base adduct were protected from dnase i a systematic deletion analysis of mpg was carried out in order to determine the minimally sized polypeptide capable of forming a stable substrate complex that is also suitable for characterization by nmr spectroscopy and x-ray a truncated polypeptide (ndelta100cdelta18) lacking 100 and 18 amino acid residues from the amino and carboxyl was found to be the minimal size that retained the truncated and wild-type enzymes have similar kinetic both emsa and dnase i footprinting studies indicated identical pattern of specific binding by the truncated and full-length removal of five and nine additional residues from the amino- and carboxyl-termini of this resulted in a complete loss of these results suggest that minimal structural change occured as a result of truncation in the ndelta100cdelta18 which may thus be suitable for elucidating the structure and mechanism of
identification of a protein isolated from senescent human cells that binds to hepatitis b virus x hepatitis b virus-encoded x antigen contributes to the development of hepatocellular given that x antigen functions by binding to other additional x-binding proteins were sought from an adult human liver cdna library in a yeast two-hybrid the results yielded a clone encoding a 55-kd protein that is associated with replicative senescence binding of p55sen to x antigen was confirmed in vitro by immunoprecipitation and affinity the expression of endogenous p55sen inversely correlated with cell transient transfection of x antigen or p55sen into hepg2 cells stimulated dna synthesis by twofold to whereas cotransfection did suggesting that these molecules functionally the detection of p55sen in embryonic mouse its absence in adult mouse and human and its reappearance in livers from carriers with chronic liver suggest that it may play important roles in the regulation of liver cell the similarity between p55sen and a notch which is involved in cell fate determinations during implies that the binding of p55sen by x antigen may also contribute to an alteration in cell which is characteristic of
sarcoplasmic reticulum and na+/ca2+ exchanger function during early and late relaxation in ventricular the relative importance of the na+/ca2+ exchanger in the initial and terminal phases of relaxation and the decline in the [ca2+]i transient was investigated in adult rabbit ventricular myocytes loaded with the ca2+ indicator fluo for electrically stimulated the peak intracellular ca2+ concentration ([ca2+]i) was 700 +/- 87 nm and end-diastolic [ca2+]i was 239 +/- 30 nm 37 degrees mm extracellular ca2+ n = abrupt inhibition of na+/ca2+ exchange was produced by removal of extracellular na+ (kcl substitution) and ca2+ [2 mm ca(2+)-free ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl acid] by means of a rapid switcher device abrupt exposure to high k+ induced an action although sufficient ca2+ remained adjacent to the sarcolemma to induce a contraction (sw beat) and [ca2+]i transient that were identical in amplitude to those induced by electrical stimulation (es the initial relaxation and decline in the [ca2+]i transient was not significantly prolonged by abrupt elimination of the na+/ca2+ but the rate and extent of the terminal phase of the decline in the [ca2+]i transient were significantly the first derivative of [ca2+]i with respect to time versus [ca2+]i during the decline of the [ca2+]i transient attributable to sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) function was estimated from the average sw and that attributable to na+/ca2+ exchange was estimated from the difference between sw and es by this the na+/ca2+ exchanger produces 13% of the first half of the decline in [ca2+]i and 45% of the second half of the we conclude that abrupt inhibition of forward na+/ca2+ exchange does not significantly affect the amplitude or the initial rate of decline of the [ca2+]i transient and its contribution to the reduction of [ca2+]i becomes apparent late during the [ca2+]i when cytosolic [ca2+]i has been

differential expression of kv4 k+ channel subunits mediating subthreshold transient k+ (a-type) currents in rat the mammalian kv4 gene subfamily and its drosophila shal counterpart encode proteins that form fast inactivating k+ channels that activate and inactivate at subthreshold potentials and recover from inactivation at a faster rate than other inactivating kv taken the properties of kv4 channels compare best with those of low-voltage activating present in the neuronal somatodendritic compartment and widely reported across several types of central and peripheral as well as the (ca2+-independent) transient outward potassium conductance of heart cells three distinct genes have been identified that encode mammalian shal homologs and of which the latter two are abundant in rat adult brain and heart the distribution in the adult rat brain of the mrna transcripts encoding the three known kv4 subunits was studied by in situ hybridization signals are very suggesting that mrnas are expressed at very low but and transcripts appear to be abundant and each produces a unique pattern of although there is overlap expression of and transcripts in several neuronal the dominant feature is one of and sometimes reciprocal for transcripts are the predominant form in the pontine nucleus and several nuclei in the whereas the substantia nigra pars the restrosplenial the superior the and the amygdala express mainly some brain structures contain both and mrnas but each dominates in distinct neuronal for in the olfactory bulb dominates in granule cells and in periglomerular in the hippocampus is the most abundant isoform in ca1 pyramidal whereas only is expressed in both are abundant in ca2-ca3 pyramidal cells and in granule cells of the dentate which also express in the dorsal thalamus strong signals are seen in several lateral whereas medial nuclei express and at moderate to low in the cerebellum but not is expressed in purkinje cells and molecular layer in the cerebellar granule cell the reciprocity between and is observed in subregions of the same neuronal in the distribution of kv4 channel transcripts in the cerebellum defines a new pattern of compartmentation of the cerebellar cortex and the first one involving molecules directly involved in signal
round-spotted pufferfish (tetraodon fluviatilis) snf5 gene is oriented in a tail-to-tail manner with the set gene which encodes an inhibitor of protein phosphatase the round-spotted pufferfish tetraodon fluviatilis has a genome size of 380 mb which is slightly smaller than that of another pufferfish fugu rubripes rubripes due to its compact genome and small fugu has been introduced as a model for genome the round-spotted pufferfish has also been proposed as a new model for genome studies because of the ease in obtaining material and high-sequence homology to that of in this we have cloned and characterized the snf5 and set genes from the round-spotted the snf5 gene is composed of 9 exons spanning about kb whereas the set gene consists of 8 exons spanning about they are linked in a tail-to-tail manner with an intergenic region of about so the genomic structures of human snf5 and set genes are based on our the pufferfish snf5 and set display high amino acid sequence identity (>90%) with the respective human by primer extension and sequence we found that putative promoter region of the snf5 gene contains a typical tata box and numerous potential binding sites for transcription factors including and as for the set its promoter region does not have any tata or ccaat motif and contains a few potential binding sites for transcriptional factors such as c-myb and when these promoter regions were placed upstream of the cat reporter gene and transfected into a carp cf cell the dna fragment of the snf5 gene displayed stronger promoter approximately three-fold higher than that of the kb dna fragment of the set by transient expression and immunofluorescent we also showed that the pufferfish snf5 and set are nuclear consistent with their postulated roles as transcriptional
time-of-day and estrous variations in behavioral and bladder histological consequences of cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in this study examined how cyclophosphamide (cp)-induced cystitis related manifestations (bladder inflammation and behavioral impairment) differed in female and male sprague-dawley under transient halothane-o2-n2o gas a single dose of cp was injected (100 mg/kg in 1 ml saline) and the behaviors analyzed for a period of 4 h using a protocol that permits quantitative analysis of behavioral the rats were then sacrificed and their bladders removed for histological quantification of all but not control exhibited a range of impairment behaviors that increased rapidly over a period of 2 gradually reaching plateau levels over the next 2 female rats initially developed behavioral responses faster than male but reached the same mean peak values overall as no sex differences were observed in cp-induced bladder influences of time-of-day and estrous stage were further examined in time-of-day had no effect on the degree of bladder although there were also no significant time-of-day differences in behavioral impairment scores from 90 min after the injection consistently tended to be lower for rats injected 5 h versus 9 h after lights the effects of estrous stage were also a subset of rats who were in the estrous stage of their cycle early in the morning of the experimental day developed the most severe degree of bladder but failed to develop the severe behavioral impairments shown by all the other these results show that there are seemingly only minor sex differences in the overall behavioral and inflammatory consequences of cp as evidenced by similar final degrees of behavioral impairment and these results also that there are sex differences in the etiology of the disease these differences are evidenced by the more rapid development of behavioral symptoms in females and the susceptibility of some of those having shown morning estrous smears to develop very severe bladder inflammation in absence of corresponding behavioral the multiple influences of sex and estrous condition on cp-induced cystitis related manifestations observed here underline the complexity of the etiological factors associated with the cystitis disease
peripheral nerve comparison of laminin and acidic fibroblast growth in an effort to show the differences between neurotrophic laminin and acidic fibroblast growth factor (afgf) were compared in terms of their abilities to regenerate axons in vivo over an extended materials and the sciatic nerve was transected in 15 sprague-dawley a 15-mm silastic tube (dow mi) was placed between the ends of the cut nerve and filled with either or buffer applied to collagen ten weeks mean axon counts showed that both laminin (2432) and afgf (1612) produced significantly higher numbers of axons than controls (1009) (p < and that laminin showed significantly more nerve regeneration than afgf (p < these results indicate that laminin and afgf enhance peripheral nerve regeneration across a large presumably through their neurotrophic effects and mitogenic properties on supporting it is concluded that the transient nature of effect on the regenerative environment limits its effectiveness at regenerating axons over a prolonged period of
identification of a protein essential for replication of porcine the largest open reading frame of porcine circovirus (orf 4) encodes a protein of 312 amino the predicted gene product of orf 4 shows similarities to rep proteins of other plant circoviruses and three motifs have been identified that are characteristic for proteins involved in rolling circle replication and the consensus sequence for a putative dntp-binding box (gks) has been in this experimental evidence is presented which indicates that orf 4 encodes the replication protein of porcine after cloning of the orf 4 gene it was supplied in trans in a transient replication the orf 4 gene product promoted the replication of plasmid which carries the origin of dna replication of porcine since pop11 itself is unable to replicate in virus-free porcine kidney the orf 4 gene product must be essential for replication of porcine
a periodogram-based method for the detection of steady-state visually evoked the task of objective perimetry is to scan the visual field and find an answer about the function of the visual flicker-burst stimulation--a physiological sensible combination of transient and steady-state stimulation--is used to generate deterministic sinusoidal responses or visually evoked potentials at the visual which are derived from the electroencephalogram by a suitable electrode in this paper we develop a new method for the detection of based on the periodogram of a we test the data for the presence of hidden periodic which correspond to steady-state the method is applied successfully to real

cardiovascular t-type calcium physiological and pharmacological cellular calcium a variety of ca2+ control processes are responsible for ca2+ homeostasis and voltage-gated ca2+ channels are dominant in the cardiovascular voltage-gated ca2+ there are several distinct subclasses of ca2+ distinguished by structural and pharmacological they include both high- and low-voltage-activated the long-lasting (l) type of high-voltage-activated channel is well characterized and is the site of action for the existing clinically available ca2+ channel verapamil and t-type ca2+ the low-voltage-activated transient (t-type) channel is widespread in the cardiovascular system and in it serves pacemaking functions and supports ca2+ signaling in secretory cells and vascular smooth the t-type channel also functions in cell growth processes under physiological and pathological mibefradil as a t-type ca2+ channel mibefradil (ro 40-5967) is a structurally novel ca2+ antagonist with selectivity for t-type over l-type this selectivity may underlie its vasodilating activity and heart rate depressive its lack of negative inotropy and its cardioprotective
effect of cheyne-stokes respiration on muscle sympathetic nerve activity in severe congestive heart failure secondary to ischemic or idiopathic dilated severe congestive heart failure (chf) is associated with cheyne-stokes (c-s) which may be an index of poorer the mechanisms linking c-s respiration to poorer functional status and prognosis in patients with chf are we tested the hypothesis that c-s respiration increases muscle sympathetic nerve activity (msna) in 9 patients with oxygen saturation was 96 +/- 1% during normal breathing and 91 +/- 1% after the apneic episodes (p < mean blood pressure was 79 +/- 8 mm hg during normal breathing and 85 +/- 8 mm hg during c-s respiration (p = c-s respiration increased msna burst frequency (from 45 +/- 5 bursts/min during normal breathing to 50 +/- 5 bursts/min during c-s p < and total integrated nerve activity (to 117 +/- p < we also studied an additional 5 patients in whom c-s breathing was without any periods of spontaneous normal in these msna was higher (65 +/- 5 bursts/min) than msna in patients in whom c-s breathing was only intermittent (45 +/- 5 p < in all 14 the effects of different phases of c-s respiration were msna was highest during the second half of each apnea (increasing to 152 +/- p < and blood pressure was highest during mild hyperventilation occurring after termination of apnea (p < we conclude that c-s respiration decreases oxygen increases and induces transient elevations in blood pressure in patients with
developmental profile and synaptic origin of early network oscillations in the ca1 region of rat neonatal by applying fura-2-based fluorometric calcium imaging to neonatal rat hippocampal slices we identified a developmentally regulated spontaneous neuronal activity in the ca1 region of the the activity consisted of bursts of intracellular ca2+ transients recurring synchronously at a slow rate of min-1 in the entire population of pyramidal neurones and these early network oscillations (enos) were present during a restricted period of postnatal they were not detected at the day of birth at p1-p4 they consisted of bursts of large (up to microm) ca2+ gradually transforming into regularly smaller ca2+ transients during the subsequent beyond p15-p16 no enos were the enos were blocked by tetrodotoxin (ttx) and by a reduction in temperature from 33-35 degrees c to 20-22 degrees by combining fluorometric imaging with whole-cell current-clamp we found that each eno-related ca2+ transient was associated with a high-frequency (up to 100 hz) train of action potentials riding on a depolarizing recordings in the voltage-clamp mode revealed barrages of synaptic currents that were strictly correlated with the eno-associated ca2+ transients in neighbouring pyramidal perfusing the cells with an intracellular solution that allowed for a discrimination between gabaa and glutamate receptor-mediated currents showed that these barrages of synaptic currents were predominantly of gabaergic the enos were totally blocked by the gabaa receptor antagonist bicuculline and they were also substantially reduced by the glutamatergic antagonists acid l-apv) and synaptic stimulation and application of the gabaa receptor agonist muscimol mimicked the spontaneous ca2+ transients in pyramidal the efficacy of muscimol in evoking ca2+ transients decreased during development in parallel with the gradual disappearance of the the developmental decrease in the amplitude of eno-associated ca2+ transients occurred in parallel with the transformation of the excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus from the immature gabaergic to the mature glutamatergic at the beginning of the first postnatal week single-shock synaptic stimulation produced ca2+ transients that were completely blocked by at the end of the second postnatal week the same type of evoked synaptic stimulation produced a ca2+ transient that was little affected by bicuculline but was abolished by the combined application of and these results demonstrate the presence of periodic and spontaneous ca2+ transients in the majority of pyramidal cells and interneurones of the neonatal ca1 hippocampal these enos exhibit a highly region-specific developmental profile and may control the activity-dependent wiring of the synaptic connectivity during early postnatal

lithium increases melanin-concentrating hormone mrna stability and inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression in pc12 melanin-concentrating hormone (mch) is a cyclic peptide involved in the regulation of food-intake behaviour and stress response in expression of the mch gene predominates in hypothalamic mechanisms governing the regulation of expression of mch gene in established cell lines were not explored we analysed the actions of nerve growth factor forskolin and lithium on mch mrna levels in the pc12 pheochromocytoma cell we compared them with those observed on tyrosine hydroxylase (th) constitutively expressed in pc12 and neurotensin (nt) taken as a in untreated mch rna species of high molecular weight were exposure of cells at a combination of ngf and lithium resulted in decreased expression of these mch rnas and in the transient production of mature mch after short exposure of pc12 cells to lithium per se elicited a marked increase in mch mrna levels whilst it exerted a potent inhibitory action on th mrna detailed investigations revealed that lithium enhanced mch mrna expression through post-transcriptional mechanisms whereas it regulated th gene expression mainly at the level of these results demonstrate that an agent widely used for treatment of manic depressive can exert an opposite effect on mch and th mrna production in pc12 the mch gene system in ngf-treated pc12 cells provides a good opportunity for studying the effect of lithium on gene expression at post-transcriptional levels in a neuron-like cellular
the enantiomer-specific kinetics and dynamics of verapamil after rapid intravenous administration to physiological analysis and the myocardial and systemic kinetics of the enantiomers of and their myocardial were measured after administration of 10 mg of racemic verapamil during 2 min to chronically instrumented the data were used to develop a physiological model of the verapamil was characterized by relatively slow transit through the lungs and the lung kinetic values were membrane whereas the tissue/blood equilibrium half-life for the heart was approximately 8 there was little difference between the kinetic values of the with the exception of their extent of deep distribution into the the time course of the increase in myocardial blood flow caused by verapamil was best related to the time course of the arterial verapamil whereas the time course of increases in the interval between p and r waves of the electrocardiogram and decreases in the maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure were best related to the time course of its myocardial the observed hysteresis for these effects compared with arterial blood was largely caused by the time required for the myocardial the model predicted that the myocardial concentrations of verapamil were relatively insensitive to the duration of injection of a given bolus but that rapid injection caused high arterial it also predicted that the bolus dose of verapamil should be modified over a 2-fold range to account for physiologically plausible variations in base-line cardiac output and myocardial blood
differential regulation of the human inhibitory (lif) promoter in t47d and mda-mb 231 breast cancer leukemia inhibitory factor (lif) is a pleiotropic inflammatory a potential role for lif in the pathogenesis of human breast cancer was recently indicated by the finding that lif is produced by mda-mb 231 breast cancer cells and that it stimulates proliferation of the t47d and mcf-7 breast cancer cell despite its role as a possible therapeutic target in breast the transcriptional regulation of the lif gene in breast cancer cells has not been investigated so in this we investigated the regulation of the human lif promoter (human lif666-luciferase) by ovarian steroids in transient transfection assays in mda-mb 231 and t47d since the mda-mb 231 cells are devoid of both estrogen (er) and progesterone (pr) these cells were co-transfected with the respective receptor expression estradiol induced no stimulation in either t47d or er-transfected mda-mb 231 treatment with the progesterone agonist mpa (medroxy-progesterone acetate) resulted in induction of lif transcription in pr-transfectant mda-mb 231 while it had no effect in t47d both pr isoforms (pr-b and pr-a) were effective in inducing the lif promoter in mda-mb 231 and this effect was inhibited by the progestin antagonist ru the stimulatory effect of mpa was maintained on deletion constructs h148lif-luc and indicating that 82 bp are sufficient to mediate this our results indicate that the lif promoter is transcriptionally active in human breast cancer cells and its activity can be modulated by progestins and anti-progestins in cells expressing the lif which might have therapeutic
effects of nitric oxide s-nitroso-l-cysteine and sodium on the whole-cell and single channel currents in single myocytes of the guinea-pig proximal the nature of the membrane channels underlying the membrane conductance changes induced by the nitric oxide (no) s-nitroso-l-cysteine (nocys) and sodium nitroprusside (snp) were investigated in single myocytes isolated from the circular muscle layer of the guinea-pig proximal by use of standard whole-cell and single channel recording under voltage depolarizing steps from -60 mv elicited a little-inactivating outward k+ current (ik) at potentials positive to -40 mv (at 20-25 degrees the steady-state level (iss) of this k current increased in amplitude as the step potential was made to more positive if the depolarizing steps were made from a holding potential of -80 mv an additional rapidly activating and inactivating outward k+ current was also superimposed on at 20-25 degrees nocys snp (100 microm) and 8-bromo-cyclic gmp (500 microm) increased the amplitude of iss of ik elicited from a holding potential of -60 in nocys (2-5 microm) had little effect on iss at 35 degrees higher concentrations (> or = 5 microm at 20-25 degrees c and > or = 10 microm at 35 degrees c) of nocys decreased the peak amplitude (i[peak]) and iss of ik in a concentration-dependent this blockade of ik with nocys was always associated with an increase of the holding current due to the activation of a membrane conductance with a reversal potential between 0 and + 30 mv and which was reduced approximately 50% upon the addition of cd2+ (1 nocys to 10 microm) or snp (100 microm) increased the activity of large conductance ca2+-activated (bk) channels in both cell-attached and excised inside-out bathed in either a symmetrical high k+ (130 mm) or an asymmetrically k+ (6 130 mmin) physiological increases in bk channel activity in nocys (10 microm) or snp (100 microm) were associated with an increase in the probability of bk channel opening and with a negative shift of the plots of against the patch with little change in the slopes of these in cell-attached the increase in with nocys was often associated with a decrease in the bk single channel in both cell-attached and excised nocys to 10 microm) also activated an additional population of channels which allowed inward current flow at potentials positive to in excised inside-out patches bathed in asymmetrical k+ physiological these single channel currents were 2-3 pa in amplitude at -30 mv and reversed in direction near + 10 even if the nacl (126 mm) concentration in the pipette solution had been replaced with an equimolar concentration of na under current nocys microm) and snp (100 microm) had variable effects on the membrane potential of colonic inducing either a small membrane hyperpolarization of <5 or a slowly-developing membrane depolarization of about 5 in nocys (5 microm) produced a transient membrane hyperpolarization which was followed by a large depolarization of the membrane potential to positive the electrotonic potentials elicited in response to an injection of constant hyperpolarizing current (10 pa for 400 ms) were little changed during the nocys (5 pm)-induced membrane but significantly reduced (to 61% of control) during the periods of membrane it was concluded that nocys and directly increased the number of active bk channels in the membrane of colonic myocytes which leads to a small rapidly oscillating membrane the following rebound depolarization in nocys arises from both the direct opening of a population of cationic channels and the blockade of voltage- and ca-activated k+ (abstract
transient surfactant protein b deficiency in a term infant with severe respiratory failure [see a 38-day-old male infant with persistent pulmonary hypertension and respiratory failure since birth was found to have a complete absence of surfactant protein b (sp-b) along with an aberrant form of sp-c in his tracheal aspirate findings consistent with the diagnosis of hereditary sp-b sp-b and sp-b messenger ribonucleic acid were present in lung biopsy dna sequence analysis demonstrated a point mutation in exon 5 of one of the sp-b gene the mother was found to be a carrier of this the other sp-b allele did not differ from the published dna sequence for the sp-b we conclude that this patient had a transient deficiency of in contrast to that of previously described infants with irreversible respiratory failure caused by hereditary sp-b we recommend that infants with suspected sp-b deficiency have serial analysis of tracheal fluid samples for both sp-b and sp-c before lung along with genetic analysis for the known sp-b we speculate that the new mutation found in one of this sp-b genes was in part responsible for the transient deficiency of
a neuronal c5a receptor and an associated apoptotic signal transduction we report the first experimental evidence of a neuronal c5a receptor (nc5ar) in human cells of neuronal expression of nc5ar mrna was demonstrated by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) in tgw human neuroblastoma expression of a functional c5ar was supported by the finding that c5a evoked a transient increase in the intracellular calcium level as measured by flow cytometry to analyse the function of the an antisense peptide fragment of the c5ar was previous data showed that a c5ar fragment (a peptide termed pr226) has c5ar agonist and antagonist effects in u-937 cells depending on the concentration of the we found that a multiple antigenic peptide (map) form of the same peptide (termed pr226-map) induced rapid elevation of nuclear c-fos immunoreactivity and resulted in dna a characteristic sign of in tgw early electrophysiological events characteristic of apoptosis were also intermittent calcium current pulses were recorded within 1-2 min of peptide c5a pretreatment delayed the onset of this calcium we also demonstrated that the apoptotic pathway is linked to nc5ar via pertussis toxin-sensitive although the function of c5a and its receptor on neurons is these results suggest that an abnormal activation of this signal transduction pathway can result in apoptosis in
regulating energy transfer in the atp sulfurylase-gtpase atp isolated from escherichia coli is a gtpase-target complex that catalyzes and links the energetics of gtp hydrolysis to the synthesis of activated sulfate when the gtp concentration is saturating and held fixed with a regenerating the aps reaction reaches a steady state in which its mass ratio is shifted x 10(6))-fold toward the product by the hydrolysis of if gtp is not the shift toward the product is producing a pulse-shaped progress the mechanistic basis of this transience is the subject of this the product transient is caused by the binding of gdp to the enzyme which establishes a catalytic pathway that allows the chemical potential that had been transferred to the aps reaction to into the chemical the system leaks because the complex catalyzes the uncoupled aps the addition of phosphate to the leaky complex converts it into the central complex which catalyzes the energy-transfer pi binding directs the system through the coupled the which also causes a is used to demonstrate that the mass ratio of the aps reaction can be by adjusting flux through the coupled and uncoupled this energy-coupling mechanism provides a means for controlling the quantity of chemical potential transferred to the aps this versatile linkage might well be used to the advantage to avoid the toxicity associated with an excess of activated
protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors block tumor necrosis factor-induced activation of nuclear degradation of nuclear translocation of and subsequent gene several inflammatory effects of tumor necrosis factor (tnf) are known to be mediated through activation of a nuclear transcription factor but how tnf activates nf-kappab is incompletely in the present we examined the role of protein tyrosine kinases (ptk) in tnf-mediated nf-kappab activation by using genistein and two potent inhibitors of the treatment of human myeloid u-937 cells with either inhibitor completely suppressed the tnf-induced nf-kappab activation in a dose- and time-dependent suppression correlated with ptk since among the structural analogues of only an active inhibitor of quercetin blocked tnf-induced nf-kappab activation and not an inactive inhibition of nf-kappab activation was not limited to myeloid as it was observed with t cells and epithelial both the ptk inhibitors blocked the degradation of the inhibitory subunit of and the consequent translocation of the p65 subunit without any significant effect on p50 or on the ptk inhibitors did not interfere with nf-kappab binding to the nf-kappab-dependent cat reporter gene expression in transient transfection assays was also suppressed by the ptk both ptk inhibitors abolished tnf-induced activation of n-terminal c-jun kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase our results suggest that a genistein- and erbstatin-sensitive ptk is involved in the pathway leading to nf-kappab activation and gene expression by tnf and thus could be used as a target for development of antiinflammatory copyright 1998 academic
comparison of relaxations evoked by photoactivation of no-containing compounds and nitrergic nerve stimulation in 5-hydroxytryptamine- and potassium-contracted rat gastric the aim of the present study was to further investigate our earlier proposal of liberation of nitric oxide (no) by photoactivation of molecules containing no or which in turn relaxes gastric smooth and to determine whether presynaptic- and/or postsynaptic no-mediated relaxation is affected differently by the degree of membrane depolarization in rat gastric fundus smooth during contraction of rat gastric fundus with 5-hydroxytryptamine 10 low 25 mm) and high potassium relaxation responses to nitrergic nerve photo-activation of caged no compounds (streptozotocin n omega-nitro-l-arginine-methylacetate n omega-nitro-d-arginine-methylacetate and sodium nitroprusside (snp) were nitrergic nerve (presynaptic) stimulation and photoactivation (postsynaptic) of all caged no compounds produced transient and reversible relaxation of 5-ht and low-k(+)-contracted when contractions were induced by high the relaxation induced by nerve stimulation was whereas relaxations induced by photoactivated no compounds were significantly (p < the relaxation induced by sodium nitroprusside but not was also diminished in high-k(+)-contracted the magnitude of photoactivated no-induced relaxation was related to the amount of no light intensity and concentration of the evidence that photoactivated no-induced relaxation is mediated by cgmp comes from the observation that but not potentiated the it is concluded that rat gastric smooth muscle relaxes to photoactivation of no or no2-carrying molecules via and it appears that degree of membrane depolarization may be a critical factor in dissociating the response to presynaptic- and postsynaptic no-mediated relaxation in this
chop is implicated in programmed cell death in response to impaired function of the endoplasmic cellular particularly in response to toxic and metabolic insults that perturb function of the endoplasmic reticulum (er is a powerful inducer of the transcription factor the role of chop in the response of cells to injury associated with er stress was examined in a murine deficiency model obtained by homologous recombination at the chop compared with the wild mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs) derived from chop -/- animals exhibited significantly less programmed cell death when challenged with agents that perturb er a similar deficit in programmed cells death in response to er stress was also observed in mefs that lack major dimerization implicating the chop-c/ebp pathway in programmed cell an animal model for studying the effects of chop on the response to er stress was it entailed exposing mice with defined chop genotypes to a single sublethal intraperitoneal injection of tunicamycin and resulted in a severe illness characterized by transient renal in chop +/+ and chop +/- mice this was associated with the early expression of chop in the proximal tubules followed by the development of a histological picture similar to the human condition known as acute tubular a process that resolved by cellular in the chop -/- in spite of the severe impairment in renal evidence of cellular death in the kidney was reduced compared with the wild the proximal tubule epithelium of chop -/- animals exhibited fourfold lower levels of tunel-positive cells (a marker for programmed cell and significantly less evidence for subsequent chop therefore has a role in the induction of cell death under conditions associated with malfunction of the er and may also have a role in cellular regeneration under such
characterization of dnac2 and dnac28 mutants by flow escherichia coli strains containing thermosensitive dnac alleles were studied by flow strains containing either the dnac2 or dnac28 allele were shifted between different and dna content distributions were inhibition of initiation of chromosome replication at nonpermissive as well as reinitiation of replication at permissive were found to be affected by a number of these included the choice of permissive and nonpermissive the length of the time of incubation at the nonpermissive the growth the type of temperature shift used for reinitiation of replication (transient or the genetic background of the host and the cell reinitiation of replication required neither transcription nor whereas the elongation stage of replication was dependent upon ongoing protein synthesis in the efficient use of dnac mutants for cell cycle studies is
the mechanism of ca2+ release from the sr of permeabilised guinea-pig and rat ureteric smooth recent work has indicated that there is a major difference in the ca2+ store of smooth muscle from rat and guinea-pig with the rat store being agonist-sensitive but ryanodine insensitive and the guinea-pig store being ryanodine sensitive but agonist insensitive 489 (1995) we have therefore examined directly the mechanism of ca2+ release from the internal ca2+ store following permeabilisation with alpha-toxin or beta-escin the sr was ca(2+)-loaded before application of carbachol or only carbachol evoked a transient contraction in rat the carbachol-induced contraction was blocked by heparin and cyclopiazonic acid (cpa) but not only caffeine produced contraction in guinea-pig and this was blocked by direct application of ip3 caused a small transient contraction in rat but not guinea-pig we conclude that rat ureter possesses only an ip3 sensitive store while guinea-pig ureter only has a ryanodine sensitive
visualization of the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase by x-ray protein-tyrosine phosphatases (ptps) are signal transduction enzymes that catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine residues via the formation of a transient cysteinyl-phosphate the mechanism of hydrolysis of this intermediate has been examined by generating a gln-262 --> ala mutant of which allows the accumulation and trapping of the intermediate within a ptp1b the structure of the intermediate at resolution reveals that a conformationally flexible loop (the wpd loop) is closed over the entrance to the catalytic sequestering the phosphocysteine intermediate and catalytic site water molecules and preventing nonspecific phosphoryltransfer reactions to extraneous phosphoryl one of the catalytic site water the likely forms a hydrogen bond to the putative catalytic in the wild-type the nucleophilic water molecule would be coordinated by the side chain of in combination with our previous structural we can now visualize each of the reaction steps of the ptp catalytic the hydrolysis of the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate of ptps is reminiscent of gtp hydrolysis by the in that both families of enzymes utilize an invariant gln residue to coordinate the attacking nucleophilic water
the role of an inverted ccaat element in transcriptional activation of the human dna topoisomerase iialpha gene by heat expression of the dna topoisomerase iialpha (topoiialpha) gene is highly sensitive to various environmental stimuli including heat the amount of topoiialpha mrna was increased 6-24 h after exposure of t24 human urinary bladder cancer cells to heat shock stress at 43 degreesc for 1 the effect of heat shock on the transcriptional activity of the human topoiialpha gene promoter was investigated by transient transfection of t24 cells with luciferase reporter plasmids containing various lengths of the promoter the transcriptional activity of the full-length promoter (nucleotides (nt) -295 to +85) and of three deletion constructs (nt -197 to -154 to and -74 to +85) was increased approximately 3-fold 24 h after heat shock in the transcriptional activity of the minimal promoter (nt -20 to which lacks the first inverted ccaat element the gc and the heat shock element located between nt -74 and was not increased by heat the transcriptional activity of promoter constructs containing mutations in the gc box or heat shock but not that of a construct containing mutations in was significantly increased by heat electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed reduced binding of a nuclear factor to an oligonucleotide containing ice1 when nuclear extracts were derived from cells cultured for 3-24 h after heat no such change in factor binding was apparent with an oligonucleotide containing the heat shock element of the topoiialpha gene in vivo footprint analysis of the topoiialpha gene promoter revealed that two g residues of ice1 that were protected in control cells became sensitive to dimethyl sulfate modification after heat these results suggest that transcriptional activation of the topoiialpha gene by heat shock requires the release of a negative regulatory factor from
mechanisms in the transcriptional regulation of bradykinin b1 receptor gene identification of a minimum cell-type specific to investigate the mechanisms of bradykinin b1 (bkb1) receptor gene transient dna transfection analyses of human bkb1 receptor gene promoter were performed in sv-40 transformed imr90 a positive regulatory element (pre) located at position -604 to -448 base pair (bp) upstream of the transcription start site consistently by the highest level of relative luciferase a negative regulatory at position -682 to -604 was able to completely ablate the function of the transfection combined with deletion and mutation analyses illustrated that the pre contains a powerful this enhancer was minimized to a 100-bp element at position -548 to -448 a 78-bp fragment of negative regulatory element functioned as a transient transfection of the enhancer driven by heterologous herpes simplex thymidine kinase into a variety of cell showed that this enhancer presents a cell-type specific in the characterization of the motifs a (-548 to -532) and b (-483 to -477) were found to be essential for full enhancer motif d (-472 to -467) played a smaller role in enhancer gel shift and antibody supershift assays determined that an ap-1 factor binds with motif the nuclear protein which binds to motif a has yet to be both factors are the critical regulators for this enhancer
hyperplastic mesothelial cells in lymph report of six cases of a benign process that can stimulate metastatic involvement by mesothelioma or we report six cases of hyperplastic mesothelial cells located in the sinuses of lymph all patients but one had a concurrent serosal fluid collection (two two one abdominal) at the time of the lymph node all effusions cleared with treatment of the underlying which included lymphoproliferative congestive heart and inflammatory diseases (dressler and four cases were associated with vascular prominence of the involved nodal a feature that may reflect the cause of the underlying effusion or support the transient persistence of benign mesothelial cells in lymph two cases were characterized by distention of the nodal sinuses by sheets of mitotically active mesothelial the differential diagnosis includes metastatic keratin-positive dendritic cells native to lymph and metastatic malignant because the latter shares both clinical and morphological features with cases of benign mesothelial cells in lymph we believe that this distinction may not always be possible in a given biopsy specimen and therefore that careful clinical follow-up is required in such
effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf)/vascular permeability factor (vpf) on haemodynamics and permselectivity of the isolated perfused rat vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) or vascular permeability factor (vpf) is a selective mitogen for endothelial it increases microvascular permeability and has been shown to relax isolated canine coronary arteries by an endothelium-dependent in many tissues vegf/vpf is expressed after an appropriate mostly in the kidney vegf/vpf is constitutively expressed in glomerular podocytes and epithelia of collecting glomerular and peritubular capillary endothelia also constitutively express specific vegf the in vivo function of renal vegf/vpf is in the present study the effects of human recombinant vegf165 on renal haemodynamics and glomerular permselectivity was investigated in the isolated perfused kidney of the in kidneys preconstricted by noradrenaline (na x 10(-7) mol/l) vegf/vpf (155 pmol/l) caused an almost complete return of renal perfusion flow rate to pre-na values (before na 113 +/- after na 15 min with vegf/vpf 111 +/- shortly after vegf/vpf administration vegf/vpf-induced relaxation and became significant after 2 min (15 min with vegf/vpf vs without vegf/vpf 111 +/- 4% vs 103 +/- in the presence of the no-synthase inhibitor n(w)-nitro-l-arginine 5 x 10(-5) mol/l) vegf/vpf caused only transient relaxations (before nna 109 +/- after nna 15 min with vegf 95 +/- the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac failed to inhibit the relaxing activity of vegf/vpf (before na 119 +/- after na + diclofenac 15 min with vegf/vpf 123 +/- vegf demonstrated no significant increase in renal protein excretion rate (after na pretreatment (= min with vegf/vpf vs without 119 +/- 10% vs 132 +/- (after nna pretreatment (= 100%) min with vegf/vpf vs without vegf/vpf 94 +/- 5% vs 96 +/- or clearance quotient of glomerular filtration rate was not influenced by vegf/vpf in kidneys pretreated with na (before na 105 +/- after na min with vegf/vpf 94 +/- 2%) or with nna (before nna 107 +/- after nna min with vegf/vpf 96 +/- fractional glucose and fractional sodium excretion showed flow-dependent vegf/vpf can contribute to the relaxing capacity of the renal this relaxation is partly mediated by the no/endothelium-derived relaxing factor (edrf) in the isolated perfused rat kidney the glomerular permeability for albumin is not affected by
management of hepatitis chronic hepatitis c is a major health care problem throughout the the disease may progress to with complications such as hepatocellular the usual primary goal of therapy is viral as patients with long-term remission are generally regarded as unlikely to develop cirrhosis or hepatocellular another primary goal should be the reduction in liver fibrosis interferon-alpha (ifn-alpha) is the only drug approved for the treatment of hepatitis c in europe and north its effectiveness appears to be related to dose and duration of the best efficacy/risk ratio seems to be in favour of 3 million units (mu) ifn-alpha three times per week on a 12-month with this a sustained alanine aminotransferase (alt) response is achieved in nearly 35% of ribavirin has emerged as potentially the second most effective while it appears unsatisfactory when given it seems much more effective in combination with combining them seems to exert a synergistic effect between the two drugs and sustained remission might be achieved in nearly 50% of patients with combination controversy persists concerning the long-term benefit of therapy in transient responders and it is possible that ifn in comparison to natural might reduce liver fibrosis progression and prevent hepatocellular even in and have greater efficacy if used in long-term whatever the treatment prolonged viral eradication may not be achieved in all patients and new drugs should be sought to improve the results of
bdnf-gfp containing secretory granules are localized in the vicinity of synaptic junctions of cultured cortical the protein family of mammalian comprising nerve-growth factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor neurotrophin-3 and -4/5 supports the survival and the phenotype of neurons from the central as well as the peripheral nervous system in exogenous application of neurotrophins has recently been found to modulate synaptic transmission in the rodent to provide evidence for a role of neurotophins as endogenous fast acting modulators of synaptic the synaptic localization and secretion of neurotrophins needs to be we have now constructed a fusion protein consisting of n-terminal bdnf (the most abundant neurotrophin in the rodent hippocampus and neocortex) and c-terminal green fluorescent protein (gfp) to elucidate the cellular localization of bdnf in cortical transient expression of bdnf-gfp in cos-7 cells revealed that the cellular localization in the trans-golgi network the processing of precursor proteins and the secretion of mature bdnf-gfp is indistinguishable from the properties of untagged upon transient transfection of primary rat cortical bdnf-gfp was found in secretory granules of the regulated pathway of as indicated by colocalization with the secretory granule marker secretogranin bdnf-gfp vesicles were found in the neurites of transfected neurons with a pattern reminiscent of the localization of endogenous bdnf in untransfected cortical bdnf-gfp vesicles were found predominantly in the somatodendritic compartment of the whereas additional axonal localization was found less immunocytochemical staining of synaptic terminals with synapsin i antibodies revealed that the density of bdnf-gfp vesicles is elevated in the vicinity of synaptic indicating that bdnf is localized appropriately to function as an acute modulator of synaptic these data suggest that bdnf-gfp will be a useful tool to investigate synaptic release of bdnf during physiological synaptic and will thereby allow us to elucidate the participation of neurotrophin release in activity dependent synaptic
importance of chronopharmacokinetics in design and evaluation of transdermal drug delivery circadian and meal effects on nicotine kinetics determine in part blood nicotine concentrations and in doing so may influence cigarette smoking behavior throughout the we have shown previously that nicotine clearance varies by approximately 17% (from peak to through) due to diurnal factors throughout the day and that meals increase nicotine clearance by about until now pharmacokinetic analyses of nicotine absorption from patches have assumed a constant clearance of nicotine over 24 using 11 individual kinetic estimates from a previous we analyzed plasma nicotine concentrations time data of two nicotine patch and conducted a set of simulations to determine the extent to which time-varying kinetics would influence the design of transdermal drug delivery intented to maintain a constant plasma nicotine concentration over 24 not incorporating time-varying kinetics leads to biased estimates of the delivery rate of the nicotine and increases the variability in the delivery rates the hypothetical transdermal drug delivery systems designed assuming constant nicotine clearance results in a systematical underdosing during the first 12 hr after beginning the transdermal drug delivery systems obtained assuming the correct time-varying clearance shows three 1) an early high delivery followed by 2) a rather but slightly decreasing at release rate and 3) transient increases in delivery rate for 2 hr after each the effect of circadian variations in clearance could be compensated for in patch design by decreasing the delivery rate during the transient variations in clearance due to meals would require the corresponding use of rapid drug delivery dosage the methods we devise to predict optimal dosing regimens in presence of chronopharmacokinetics might be useful for other medications in which blood levels need to be precisely
effects of three sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum ca++ pump inhibitors on release channels of intracellular the three principal sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum ca++ pump inhibitors have been compared for their effects on ca++ fluxes across intracellular stores present in isolated skeletal muscle and brain membrane at moderate concentrations that only partially inhibited ca++ all three inhibitors induced transient release of ca++ from isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum and release was ruthenium much faster and sustained at higher pump inhibitor in in unidirectional 45ca efflux cyclopiazonic acid appeared to have little thapsigargin decreased efflux and increased efflux only these observations taken together suggest that transient releases were manifest primarily by vesicles with a high ratio of ryanodine receptors to pumps (and thus more susceptible to becoming leaky with only some pumps and that ca(++)-induced ca++ release amplified releases when all pumps were these mostly indirect side effects were specific for ryanodine in similar experiments with brain cerebellar none of the three inhibitors appeared to directly reduce release induced by inositol these findings may affect interpretation of results of experiments involving application of these compounds to isolated cells or tissue
myod and mef2a mediate activation and repression of the p75ngfr gene during muscle in an effort to clarify transient expression of the ngf low-affinity receptor p75ngfr during muscle development we have focused on the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation and cessation of p75ngfr gene using quiescent c3h10t1/2 fibroblast as a we observed that induction of differentiation competence in myod-transfected 10t1/2 fibroblasts was accompanied by the initiation of p75ngfr we could show that the bhlh transcription factor myod itself is a powerful candidate for transcriptional activation of the p75ngfr gene in muscle precursor by means of myod-mutants we have found that both the amino terminus of the myod molecule as well as the bhlh-region are essential for transcriptional activity on the p75ngfr the fact that myocyte enhancer factor mef2a inactivated myod-induced p75ngfr promoter activity strongly suggests that cell-specific regulation of the p75ngfr gene might be strictly dependent on the intracellular composition and balance of the appropriate bhlh-transcription factors and their
transient poly(adp-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins and role of poly(adp-ribose) polymerase in the early stages of a transient burst of poly(adp-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins occurs prior to commitment to in human osteosarcoma cells undergoing followed by caspase-3-mediated cleavage of poly(adp-ribose) polymerase the generality of this early burst of poly(adp-ribosyl)ation has now been investigated with human hl-60 mouse and immortalized fibroblasts derived from wild-type the effects of eliminating this early transient modification of nuclear proteins by depletion of parp protein either by antisense rna expression or by gene disruption on various morphological and biochemical markers of apoptosis were then marked caspase-3-like parp cleavage proteolytic processing of cpp32 to its active internucleosomal dna and nuclear morphological changes associated with apoptosis were induced in control 3t3-l1 cells treated for 24 h with anti-fas and cycloheximide but not in parp-depleted 3t3-l1 antisense cells exposed to these similar results were obtained with control and parp-depleted human jurkat t whereas immortalized parp +/+ fibroblasts showed the early burst of poly(adp-ribosyl)ation and a rapid apoptotic response when exposed to anti-fas and parp -/- fibroblasts exhibited neither the early poly (adp-ribosyl)ation nor any of the biochemical or morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis when similarly stable transfection of parp -/- fibroblasts with wild-type parp rendered the cells sensitive to fas-mediated these results suggest that parp and poly(adp-ribosyl)ation may trigger key steps in the apoptotic subsequent degradation of parp by caspase-3-like proteases may prevent depletion of nad and atp or release certain nuclear proteins from poly(adp-ribosyl)ation-induced both of which might be required for late stages of
otoacoustic emission and auditory efferent function testing in patients with sensori-neural hearing to examine the role of otoacoustic emissions and auditory efferent system function in evaluating auditory functional status in both normal and diseased spontaneous and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and efferent function in terms of contralateral white noise induced transient evoked otoacoustic emission suppressions were tested and cross compared in 32 normal 24 ears with cochlear hearing loss and 16 ears with retrocochlear hearing transient evoked otoacoustic emission amplitude and contralateral spontaneous otoacoustic emission peaks and frequency range were significantly reduced in cochlear hearing loss while in retrocochlear hearing loss transient evoked otoacoustic emission and spontaneous otoacoustic emission levels were significantly higher than in cochlear hearing loss group and showed no contralateral acoustic stimulation induced transient evoked otoacoustic emission suppression as an index of efferent function is clinically combined otoacoustic emission and efferent tests are of great significance in evaluating cochlea status and auditory central auditory efferent function is weakened in cochlear lesions and severely damaged in retrocochlear
autologous human collagen and dermal fibroblasts for soft tissue augmentation of soft tissue defects can be achieved through intradermal injection of animal plasma-gelatin and due to their rapid degradation in clinical effects are typically the use of autologous human collagen could conceivably result in sustained clinical improvement due to decreased collagen the purpose of this study was to determine whether prolonged dermal correction could be achieved through injection of autologous human significant sustained clinical improvement was observed in two of the original 12 patients entered into the the nasolabial fold region was shown to be the most responsive facial area to the use of injectable autologous human collagen for soft tissue correction remains an intriguing while the findings of this study indicate possible sustained clinical improvement using this autologous system in some it remains difficult to predict the degree and duration of individual response in various

relationship between the increase in ca2+ transient and contractile force induced by angiotensin ii in aequorin-loaded rabbit ventricular pieces of evidence have been accumulating that imply a crucial role of angiotensin ii (ang ii) in initiation and progress of heart but the signalling processes subsequent to ang ii receptor activation in cardiac myocytes are complex and still we examined the effects of ang ii on the relationship between the intracellular ca2+ transient and isometric contraction in mammalian ventricular isolated rabbit ventricular papillary muscle was loaded with the ca2+ sensitive bioluminescent protein aequorin and electrically stimulated at a rate of hz at 37 degrees ang ii (10(-8)-10(-6) in the presence of bupranolol (3 x 10(-7) m) and prazosin (10(-7) elicited a positive inotropic effect (pie) in association with an increase in the peak ca2+ the maximal pie of ang ii was about 30% of the isoproterenol-induced maximum while the maximal increase in the peak ca2+ transient induced by ang ii was only 7% of ang ii tended to prolong the duration of contraction (both time to peak force and relaxation time) but did not produce a discernible change in the duration of ca2+ the relationship between the amplitude of ca2+ transient and peak force was shifted to the left by ang as compared with the relationship for elevation of [ca2+]o the pie and the increase in the amplitude of ca2+ transient induced by ang ii were abolished by a selective angiotensin type 1 (at1) receptor antagonist losartan (10(-5) m) but were not affected by a selective at2 receptor antagonist pd123319 (10(-6) these results indicate that ang ii elicits a pie through a dual mechanism via activation of at1 receptors in rabbit ventricular by an increase in the amplitude of ca2+ and in addition by an increase in the myofilament ca2+
disturbances in hormonal profiles of night workers during their usual sleep and work in a previous the authors reported that the 24-h rhythms of pituitary and adrenal hormones--that thyrotropin prolactin growth and cortisol--adapted only partially in a group of permanent night the real impact of circadian rhythm alterations on the health and well-being of subjects is still in this the authors focus on an ergonomic field and address questions of adaptation of these hormones during the usual day sleep time (0700-1500 h) and during the usual night work time (2200-0600 h) in permanent night eleven night working a night schedule for at least 2 submitted to a high-frequency blood sampling procedure (10 min) and to electroencephalographic recordings during the endocrine profiles of night workers were compared to those of day-active subjects studied during their usual sleep-wake during usual day despite an adapted sleep cortisol levels among night workers were abnormally whereas the tsh decreased in comparison to the plateau observed among day-active during usual work some hormonal disturbances in particular concerning cortisol and prl (two hormones known to reflect the level of among night the work time was associated with the quiescent period of cortisol secretion normally occurring during the first hours of and with a transient prl these results revealed altered hormonal profiles during the sleep time of night workers that do not result in an altered sleep the nocturnal work which requires a high level physical and mental is associated with some endocrine alterations reflecting an eventual phase of

voltage-clamp analysis and computer simulation of a novel cesium-resistant a-current in guinea pig laterodorsal tegmental increased firing of cholinergic neurons of the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (ldt) plays a critical role in generating the behavioral states of arousal and rapid eye movement the majority of these neurons exhibit a prominent transient potassium current (ia) that shapes firing but the properties of which have not been examined in although ia has been reported to be blocked by intracellular the ia in ldt neurons appeared resistant to intracellular the present study compared the properties of this cesium-resistant current to those typically ascribed to whole cell recordings were obtained from ldt neurons (n = 67) in brain slices with potassium- or cesium-containing pipette a transient current was observed in cells dialyzed with each solution in cesium-dialyzed the transient current was inward at test potentials negative to about -35 extracellular 4-aminopyridine 2-5 mm) blocked both inward and outward suggesting the inward current was reversed ia rather than an unmasked transient calcium current as previously this conclusion was supported by increasing [k]o from 5 to 15 which shifted the reversal potential positively for both inward and outward current +/- mean +/- recovery from inactivation was rapid (tau = +/- 4 n = as reported for and both inward and outward transient current persisted in calcium-free solution [0 calcium/4 mm ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl n = 4] and during cadmium-blockade of calcium currents (n = the transient current was blocked by intracellular 4-ap indicating that adequate dialysis occurred during the thus the cs-resistant current is a subthreshold we also estimated the voltage-dependence of activation (v1/2 = +/- 2 k = +/- n = 6) and inactivation (v1/2 = 0 +/- k = +/- n = 3) of this computer simulations using a morphologically accurate model cell indicated that except for the extreme case of only distal a-channels and a high intracellular our parameter estimates were good in guinea pig ldt neurons express subthreshold a-channels that are resistant to intracellular cesium this suggests that these channels differ fundamentally in their ion permeation mechanism from those previously it remains to be determined if cs+ resistance is common among brain a-channels or if this property is conferred by known a-channel
transient kinetics and thermodynamics of anthroylouabain binding to the na/k-atpase is an integral membrane protein enzyme which uses energy derived from hydrolysis of atp to pump na+ out of and k+ into the ouabain belongs to a class of drugs known as cardiac which are useful for treating congestive heart therapeutic value is achieved when these drugs bind to and inhibit the na/k-atpase of cardiac we gain insight into this important interaction by measuring the thermodynamics of the interaction of anthroylouabain a fluorescent derivative of with the ao has the useful property that its fluorescence intensity is greatly enhanced (approximately 10x) when it binds to the using this we measure temperature dependence of transient kinetics for the association and dissociation of ao interacting with membrane fragments of na/k-atpase purified from dog using a standard eyring we find that the overall association of ao with the enzyme is driven by substantial contributions from both enthalpy and and that in an energy diagram for the association the free energy change is quite similar to that of ouabain deduced from previously published results bba 307 (1973) in the transition there are substantial differences for the enthalpy and presumably due to the presence of the anthracene
effects of epidermal growth factor on the invasion activity of the bladder cancer cell epidermal growth factor (egf) is excreted in high concentrations in the urine and stimulates urothelial cell the cultured bladder cancer cell line ku-1 was used to study the molecular mechanisms by which egf affects urothelial tumor growth and invasion materials and ku-1 cells were grown in cell culture in the presence or absence of anchorage-independent cell growth assays and matrigel invasion assays were expression of cytokeratins was examined by northern and western blot chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays were used to determine whether egf stimulated matrix metalloproteinase egf enhanced anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and increased the number of cells penetrating into a matrigel a transient transfection assay revealed that egf increased the promoter activities of the matrix metalloproteinase 1 and 9 genes in ku-1 the morphology of ku-1 cells changed after the addition of egf to the culture western and northern blot analyses demonstrated that egf decreased cytokeratin 19 but did not affect expression of cytokeratin 8 or egf increased the invasive activity of ku-1 bladder cancer cells in part by increasing the secretion of matrix morphologic changes may result from altered composition of cytoskeletal

gamma-aminobutyric acida receptor function is desensitised in rat cultured cerebellar granule cells following chronic flunitrazepam this study examined gamma-aminobutyric acida (gaba(a)) receptor function in cultured rat cerebellar granule cells by using microphysiometry following chronic flunitrazepam and correlated the findings with the alpha1 and beta2/3 subunit protein expression and [3h]muscimol binding after the same treatment flunitrazepam treatment reduced (p < the maximal gaba-stimulated increase in extracellular acidification rate (emax) +/- and +/- 2-day control and treated +/- and +/- 7-day control and treated best-fit emax +/- n = without affecting the gaba concentration required to elicit 50% of maximal response (ec50) +/- and +/- 2-day control and treated +/- and +/- 7-day control and treated best-fit ec50 +/- n = flunitrazepam exposure also abolished the flunitrazepam potentiation of the gaba caused a transient reduction of the gaba(a) receptor alpha1 and beta2/3 subunit proteins over the initial 2 but did not alter [3h]muscimol binding compared with vehicle-treated the results suggest that changes in gaba(a) receptor subunit protein rather than loss of [3h]muscimol binding underlie the chronic flunitrazepam-mediated desensitisation of gaba(a) receptor
rapid onset of ulnar nerve dysfunction during transient occlusion of the brachial perioperative ulnar neuropathy is a complication that occurs even in patients who seem to be appropriately padded and the disproportionately high incidence of postoperative ulnar nerve injury compared with the median and radial nerves has largely been attributed to its vulnerability to compression or stretch at the cubital some clinical and laboratory evidence suggests that compromise of perfusion to the upper extremity may also play a role in this to determine whether the ulnar nerve is more sensitive to ischemia of the upper we studied 10 men during general somatosensory evoked potentials of the and ulnar nerves were simultaneously recorded during general anesthesia with the brachial artery occluded proximal to the cubital all three nerves showed rapid changes in signal amplitude in response to occlusion of the brachial but the amplitude of the ulnar nerve was affected earlier and to a greater compared with the median the change in ulnar nerve signal amplitude during ischemia was significantly greater after 4 min (p = this trend persisted at 6 and 8 min (p = at and 8 min of the ulnar nerve likewise showed a greater decrease in amplitude compared with the radial with corresponding p values of and we conclude that the ulnar nerve is more sensitive to ischemia of the upper extremity compared with the radial and median in addition to its increased vulnerability at the compromise of arterial flow may contribute to some cases of postoperative ulnar postoperative ulnar neuropathy is thought to result from compression or stretch of the ulnar nerve at the patients may sustain this complication despite careful padding and this study suggests that the ulnar nerve may also be unusually sensitive to decreases in blood supply to the care should not only to properly position and pad the but also to ensure adequate perfusion of the upper
changing the nature of the initial chaperonin capture complex influences the substrate folding for the chaperonin malate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase the folding and the lifetimes of folding intermediates were measured with either the nucleotide-free groel or the activated chaperonin with both nucleotide-free and activated the folding efficiency of rhodanese and mdh remained high over a large range of groel to substrate concentration ratios (up to in the folding efficiency of gs began to decline at ratios lower than at ratios where the refolding yields were initially the only a relatively small increase in misfolding kinetics of mdh was observed with either the nucleotide-free or activated chaperonin for no change was detected with either chaperonin in gs lost its ability to interact with the chaperonin system at an accelerated rate (8-fold increase) when the activated complex instead of the nucleotide-free complex was used to rescue the protein from our data demonstrate that the differences in the refolding yields are related to the intrinsic folding kinetics of the protein we suggest that the early kinetic events at the substrate level ultimately govern successful chaperonin-substrate interactions and play a crucial role in dictating polypeptide flux through the chaperonin our results also indicate that an accurate assessment of the transient properties of folding intermediates that dictate the initial chaperonin-substrate interactions requires the use of the activated complex as the interacting chaperonin
antitumor immunity induction by intracellular hyperthermia using magnetite cationic induction of antitumor immunity to t-9 rat glioma by intracellular hyperthermia using functional magnetic particles was magnetite cationic liposomes which have a positive surface were used as heating mediators for intracellular solid t-9 glioma tissues were formed subcutaneously on both femurs of female f344 and mcls were injected via a needle only into the left solid tumors (treatment the rats were then divided into two which received no or irradiation for 30 min given three times at 24-h intervals with an alternating magnetic field (118 384 on the treatment the tumor tissue disappeared completely in many rats exposed to the magnetic the tumor tissue on the opposite side also disappeared even though mcls were not injected into the right solid to examine whether a long-lasting and tumor-specific immunity could be the rats that had been cured by the hyperthermia treatment were rechallenged with t-9 cells 3 months after a period of transient all tumors immunocytochemical assay revealed that the immune response induced by the hyperthermia treatment was mediated by both cd8+ and cd4+ t cells and accompanied by a marked augmentation of tumor-selective cytotoxic t lymphocyte these results suggest that our magnetic particles are potentially effective tools for hyperthermic treatment of solid because in addition to killing of the tumor cells by a host immune response is
effect of positioning on svo2 in the critically ill patient with a low ejection critically ill patients with a low ejection fraction may be vulnerable to decreased mixed venous oxygen saturation (svo2) resulting from position the objectives of this study were to describe the effects of changes in positioning on svo2 in critically ill patients with a low ejection fraction (< or = 30%) and to describe the contribution of variables of oxygen delivery (do2) and oxygen consumption (vo2) to the variance in an experimental two-group repeated-measures design was used to study 42 critically ill patients with an ejection fraction of less than or equal to 30% (m= patients were assigned randomly to one of two position right left or left right data on svo2 were collected at each minute after position change for 5 and at 15 and 25 repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance showed a difference in svo2 among the three positions across time (p< with the greatest differences occurring within the first 4 minutes and in the left lateral stepwise multiple regression showed that vo2 accounted for a greater proportion of the variance in svo2 with position change than did do2 (54% [p = 31% [p= changes in svo2 occur with positioning in critically ill patients with a low ejection these changes are transient and are the result of changes in vo2 rather than changes in
