seasonal variation in fibrinogen in the rotterdam as evidence accumulates to implicate fibrinogen as a risk indicator for cardiovascular it is of interest to study its seasonal a population based cross-sectional study was performed among participants of the rotterdam a cohort of men and aged 55 years and fibrinogen levels were measured by the prothrombin time derived method in the first participants of the fibrinogen levels were considerably higher in the seasonal difference was g/l (95% confidence interval and was more pronounced in subjects aged 75 years and over than in subjects aged 55 to 75 g/l and g/l additional adjustment for body mass systolic and diastolic blood and total and hdl cholesterol did not materially change the after adjustment for outdoor temperature was not associated with adjustment for outdoor temperature did not change the seasonal variation of seasonal difference g/l in fibrinogen levels are highest in the seasonal variation of fibrinogen is more pronounced in the outdoor temperature does not seem to play a role in the seasonal variation of seasonal variation of fibrinogen may partly explain the increased cardiovascular disease mortality in
psychological distress among women with recurrent spontaneous fifty-seven of 100 women with recurrent abortion completed questionnaires designed to assess demographic and reproductive social locus of and marital the results indicated that 32% of the women could be classified as the subjects also reported higher than average levels of acute and chronic fifty-three percent of the subjects reported below average marital post hoc analyses indicated that the women who had a previous elective abortion had higher levels of lower marital and different attributions regarding their pregnancy losses than the women who had not had an elective having a living child was not a protective buffer against psychological
child mortality in a cross-sectional this paper is a study of the determinants of child mortality in the relatively developed indian state of data from the national family health survey 1992-93) conducted in the state of goa have been used to examine the child mortality experiences of women who were within a marriage lasting 15 an aggregated index of child which summarizes the mortality experiences of a woman with exposure is the study maternal education and longer birth spacing were found to lower child mortality risks
flow-mediated dilation in 9- to 11-year-old the influence of intrauterine and childhood early life particularly size at may influence later risk of cardiovascular but a mechanism for this influence has not been we have examined the relation between birth weight and endothelial function (a key event in atherosclerosis) in a population-based study of taking into account classic cardiovascular risk factors in methods and we studied 333 british children aged 9 to 11 years in whom information on birth maternal and risk factors (including blood lipid preload and postload glucose smoking and socioeconomic status) was a noninvasive ultrasound technique was used to assess the ability of the brachial artery to dilate in response to increased blood flow (induced by forearm cuff occlusion and an endothelium-dependent birth weight showed a positive association with flow-mediated dilation 95% to childhood cardiovascular risk factors (blood total and ldl and salivary cotinine level) showed no relation with flow-mediated but hdl cholesterol level was inversely related 95% to the relation between birth weight and flow-mediated dilation was not affected by adjustment for childhood body cardiovascular risk social or low birth weight is associated with impaired endothelial function in a key early event in growth in utero may be associated with long-term changes in vascular function that are manifest by the first decade of life and that may influence the long-term risk of cardiovascular

three-year trials of personal therapy among schizophrenic patients living with or independent of effects on adjustment of previous analyses of the personal and social adjustment of outpatients with schizophrenia have either relied on the assessment of unrepresentative patients who survived without relapse or used analyses that included relapse a potential confound when different rates of relapse existed among treatment the goal was to conduct a study of the effects of personal therapy on outcome that was designed to take into consideration the effects of they evaluated the effectiveness of personal therapy over 3 years after hospital discharge among 151 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective the patients were randomly assigned to receive personal therapy or contrasting therapies in one of two concurrent one trial included patients who were living with family (n = the other included patients who were living independent of family (n = patients were assessed at 6-month intervals over 3 years of treatment on measures of personal and social patients who relapsed and restabilized and those who did not relapse were personal therapy had positive effects on broad components of social adjustment (role performance) but had few differential effects on and patients receiving personal therapy remained more anxious than patients who received family or supportive for patients who were living with personal therapy led to better outcomes in overall performance than did the other although family therapy had only one positive effect on social the personal adjustment (residual symptoms) of patients who received family therapy appeared to improve more than that of patients receiving personal or supportive for patients not living with personal therapy was more successful than supportive therapy in improving work performance and relationships out of the longitudinal effects of personal therapy on symptoms were similar to those of family and supportive particularly in the first 2 but personal therapy effect sizes increased over time on measures of social personal therapy has pervasive effects on the social adjustment of patients with schizophrenia that are independent of relapse supportive with or without family produces adjustment effects that peak at 12 months after discharge and plateau personal a definitive psychosocial continues to improve the social adjustment of patients in the second and third years after brief treatment would appear to be less effective than a disorder-relevant intervention for
acid-base regulation in tadpoles of rana catesbeiana exposed to environmental tadpoles of rana catesbeiana were exposed to different levels of environmental the acid-base regulatory response differed from that in adult amphibians in showing a high degree of ph compensation in the extracellular fluid (65-85%) and complete compensation in the intracellular fluid (tail muscle and liver) within 24 hypercapnia induced a massive transfer of hco3- equivalents and ca2+ from the tadpoles to the which lasted some 4-6 bicarbonate accumulated in the body fluids came mainly from internal buffer sources (probably caco3 in lime sacs and/or skin it is suggested that the large bicarbonate efflux from the animal is a consequence of the dissolution of caco3 stores and the delayed adjustment of bicarbonate-retaining re-exposure of tadpoles to hypercapnia after 1-3 weeks of normocapnic recovery only affected transepithelial fluxes of acid-base equivalents suggesting that mobilisable caco3 stores were depleted during the first exposure to hypercapnia and that they were not the caco3 stores may normally be mobilised during the slowly developing internal hypercapnia that occurs during
familial resemblance for abdominal visceral the heritage family abdominal visceral fat (avf) is considered a risk factor for atherogenic lipid profiles and little is known about the genetic contribution to avf as compared to total body avf was assessed by computerized and total body fat (fat mass) was assessed by underwater weighing in 86 families participating in the heritage family all family members were sedentary at baseline the familial factors underlying the variability in age-adjusted age-fat mass-adjusted avf and age-adjusted fat were assessed using a familial correlation the maximal heritability (including genetic and familial environmental effects) for avf was comparable before (47%) and after (48%) adjusting for fat and was 55% for fat mass itself in these sedentary spouse correlations were significant for fat mass and for avf prior but not adjustment for fat these results confirm the only previous study which investigated the familial aggregation of avf (both in pattern and suggesting that the factors underlying avf in these sedentary families may be similar to those in the population at although both genetic and familial environmental factors probably influence each of fat mass and there appears to be a predominantly genetic etiology for the visceral component which is independent of total body these findings imply that some individuals are more at risk then others because of an inherited tendency to store abdominal fat viscerally rather than
body physical and the risk of endometrial endometrial cancer is associated with increased weight and body and other conditions that may result from an excess in calories or lack of physical although a few studies have explored the effect of dietary constituents on the risk of endometrial the nature of the joint association of these constituents and energy or energy expenditure with risk is a population-based case-control study was conducted in hawaii to examine the association of body and physical activity with the risk of endometrial subjects included 332 histologically primary endometrial cancer cases and 511 controls identified between 1985 and cases and controls were residents of hawaii who were between 18 and 84 years of age and were from one of the following ethnic native and cases were identified through the hawaii tumor registry and matched to the controls on age years) and in-person conducted in the included and medical histories and use of exogenous physical and other lifestyle and skinfold measurements were taken at the time of the we found a strong dose-response relation of increased body size to the development of endometrial cancer after adjustment for energy the odds ratio (or) for endometrial cancer among women in the highest quartile of body mass index kg/m2) was more than four times that among women in the lowest and wrist girths were positively associated with the estimated risk of endometrial cancer after adjustment for total calories and other nondietary risk although the trends in the ors were attenuated after adjustment for physically active women had a modest reduction in their risk of disease compared with inactive cases consumed a greater percentage of their calories from fat and a lower percentage of their calories from carbohydrates than did adjustment for bmi reduced the ors for the highest compared with the lowest quartile of fat calorie intake from (95% confidence to (95% confidence suggesting that part of the association is explained by there was a differential effect of fat on endometrial cancer according to for all components of the associations with endometrial cancer were either minimal or absent among leaner women those with bmi below the among more obese two-fold differences in risk were observed between women above and below the median of fat foods that are high in fat and such as red and were positively associated with endometrial whereas and particularly those high in were inversely these findings suggest that women who avoid being overweight and who consume a diet low in plant and animal fats and high in complex carbohydrates are at a reduced risk of endometrial

significance of ion transport during lung development and in respiratory disease of the active ion transport plays a critical role in the liquid movement across the fetal and perinatal lung the fetal lung liquid production is coupled with active secretion of cl- into the luminal the potential for fluid absorbing mechanisms related to active na+ transport from the apical to the basolateral side of the epithelium appears near the end of at birth there is a dramatic change of environment with commencement of sudden increase in oxygen partial pressure (po2) and profound changes in the pulmonary a concurrent switch from fluid secretion to maintenance of low amounts of alveolar fluid is another major physiological adjustment taking place in the perinatal distal lung the fluid-absorbing mechanism is a result of a well-synchronized co-operation between the basolateral membrane na-k-atpase and the apical membrane na+ channels and it promotes salt and water movement from the inability of the fetal lung epithelium to switch from fluid secretion to na+ transport-dependent absorption seems to be an important factor adversely contributing to the respiratory distress of the newborn premature
