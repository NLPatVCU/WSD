profound disturbances of pre- and postsynaptic gabab-receptor-mediated processes in region ca1 in a chronic model of temporal lobe this report examines alterations in presynaptic and postsynaptic processes mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid-b (gabab) receptors within hippocampal region ca1 in a model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy intracellular recordings were obtained in pyramidal cells from combined hippocampal/parahippocampal control slices and slices obtained > or = 1 mo after a period of self-sustaining limbic status epilepticus (sslse) induced by continuous hippocampal monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (ipsps) were evoked by placement of the stimulating electrode in stratum pyramidale within 500 microns of the recording electrode in the presence of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and d(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric control ipsps exhibited early (gabaa-receptor-mediated) and late (gabab-receptor-mediated) in post-sslse ipsps displayed only a gabaa-receptor-mediated post-sslse ipsps were completely eliminated by antagonists of the gabaa receptor (bicuculline methiodide and in control gabab receptor antagonists p-(3-aminopropyl)-p-diethoxymethyl-phosphinic acid (cgp ethyl]amino-2-(s)- hydroxypropyl-p-benzyl-phosphinic acid (cgp and 2-hydroxysaclofen eliminated the late component of the biphasic ipsp but had no discernible effect on ipsps evoked in post-sslse ca1 pyramidal a paired pulse paradigm was employed to investigate the integrity of presynaptic gabab-receptor-mediated inhibition of gaba to isolate pure gabaa-receptor-mediated and thus facilitate comparison with post-sslse control neurons were penetrated with intracellular electrodes containing n-ethyl bromide and ipsps were evoked employing the monosynaptic ipsp in paired pulses [interpulse intervals (ipis) of ms] resulted in a diminution of the second gabaa-receptor-mediated chloride ipsp (ipspa) relative to the maximum paired pulse depression (ppd) occurred at an ipi of 100 gabab receptor antagonists reduced ppd without affecting the amplitude of the gabab receptor agonist baclofen reduced the amplitude of both the first and second ipspa and largely alleviated in no ppd was evident at any ipi in post-sslse neither antagonists nor agonists of gabab-receptor-mediated processes had an effect on either the degree of ppd or the amplitude of to better approximate the pattern of ca1 pyramidal cell activation occurring during epileptiform ipspas were evoked by trains of in mean monosynaptic ipspa amplitude decreased by approximately 60% during a 5-s with more than half the decline coming between the first and second in no significant ipspa depression resulted from delivery of stimulus baclofen reduced the amplitude of control ipspas evoked during stimulus both agonist and antagonists significantly lessened the degree of ipsp these same agents altered neither ipsp amplitude nor the degree of use-dependent ipsp depression produced in post-sslse tissue during stimulus we conclude that a dysfunction of both presynaptic and postsynaptic gabab-receptor-mediated processes occurs in hippocampal area ca1 in the post-sslse model of gabab receptor agonists and antagonists had no effect on post-sslse ca1 pyramidal cell synaptic whereas antagonists of the gabaa receptor completely eliminated repetitive activation produced no use-dependent synaptic the implications of these findings for the epileptogenic potential of post-sslse ca1 and the basket hypothesis are
clinical significance of cytogenetic findings in solid chromosome analysis of solid tumors is becoming an increasingly useful tool to help establish a correct diagnosis and to provide prognostically important characteristic karyotypic patterns in terms of degree of cytogenetic complexity and type of nonrandom abnormalities may help to distinguish neoplasia from a nonneoplastic lesion and to differentiate between a benign and a malignant more the presence of a specific or pathognomonic change may confirm or refute a suspected provide an unsuspected and trace the origin of a specific cytogenetic abnormalities may be of and sometimes help in four groups of differential diagnostic (1) benign malignant epithelial tumors of the thyroid salivary and (2) benign malignant mesenchymal tumors of adipose and muscle (3) differentiation between various malignant bone and soft tissue and (4) diagnosis of undifferentiated small-cell round-cell in addition to the diagnostic karyotypic findings may provide prognostic the presence of an abnormal clone and/or complex rearrangements is a poor prognostic sign carcinomas of the and characteristic cytogenetic aberrations are now known to be valuable prognostic parameters in malignant malignant fibrous germ cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck many of the correlation analyses are but they all point in the same namely that cytogenetic studies will soon play the same essential role in the management of patients with solid tumors as they do today in hematologic
standardization of a computerized method for calculating autonomic function test responses in healthy subjects and patients with diabetes the objectives of the present study were 1) to compare results obtained by the traditional manual method of measuring heart rate (hr) and heart rate response (hrr) to the valsalva standing and deep with those obtained using a computerized data analysis system attached to a standard electrocardiograph 2) to standardize the responses of healthy subjects to cardiovascular and 3) to evaluate the response to these tests in a group of patients with diabetes mellitus in all subjects (97 healthy and 143 with dm) we evaluated hrr to deep hrr to hrr to the valsalva and blood pressure response (bpr) to standing up and to a sustained since there was a strong positive correlation between the results obtained with the computerized method and the traditional we conclude that the new method can replace the traditional manual method for evaluating cardiovascular responses with the advantages of speed and hrr and bpr of men and women did not a correlation between age and hrr was observed for standing (r = p < and deep breathing (r = p < abnormal bpr to standing was usually observed only in diabetic patients with definite and severe degrees of autonomic

glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor attenuates the excitotoxin-induced behavioral and neurochemical deficits in a rodent model of the present study determined the effects of intraventricularly administered glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor on the behavioral and neurochemical sequelae of unilateral excitotoxic lesions of the distinct asymmetrical rotational behavior in response to peripheral administration of amphetamine (5 mg/kg) was noted one and two weeks following injections of quinolinic acid (200 nmol) into two sites in the left in rats given a single intraventricular injection of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (10-1000 micrograms) 30 min before the amphetamine-induced rotational behavior was significantly analysis of nissl-stained coronal sections showed marked neuronal loss in the striatum ipsilateral to the quinolinic acid which was at least partially prevented by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor d1 and d2 dopamine binding sites in the the majority of which are localized to subpopulations of gabaergic were decreased to a similar extent by quinolinic the reduction was attenuated by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor treatment to a similar suggesting that the two subpopulations of gabaergic striatal output neurons are equally vulnerable to excitotoxic concomitant changes in neurotransmitter function as a result of the lesion were also [3h]gaba uptake into striatal target tissues (globus pallidus and substantia nigra) was considerably reduced in the lesioned compared to the contralateral unlesioned as were [3h]choline and [3h]dopamine uptake into striatal striatal choline acetyltransferase activity was decreased by the decrements in neuropeptide levels of similar magnitude were evident ipsilateral to the substance met-enkephalin and dynorphin a contents in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra were significantly striatal somatostatin and neuropeptide y levels were not all of the neurochemical deficits induced by striatal quinolinic acid lesions were attenuated by intraventricular delivery of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic continuous intraventricular infusion of this trophic factor (10 micrograms/day) over a two-week period did not afford notable improvement compared to the single injection of 10 in continuous infusion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (10 micrograms/day) directly into the striatum did not affect any of the neurochemical parameters neurotrophin-3 (10 micrograms/day) delivery into the striatum significantly increased [3h]gaba but only modestly affected [3h]choline the results indicate that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor counteracts neuronal damage induced by a striatal excitotoxic insult and support its potential use as a treatment for central nervous system disorders that may be a consequence of excitotoxic such as
the use of hyperventilation in contrast-enhanced mr of brain angiographic studies have demonstrated improved visibility of glial tumors after the present study was undertaken to determine whether hyperventilation would change the mr enhancement characteristics of various glial eighteen patients were studied once with standard contrast-enhanced mr imaging and again with standard imaging plus after six low-grade astrocytomas showed no change and three showed a small decrease in relative enhancement the ependymomas showed a 10% to 13% increase in the degree of but no change in the area of all the anaplastic astrocytomas showed an increase in the degree of enhancement three of the anaplastic astrocytomas showed new foci of enhancement that were not seen on the nonhyperventilation hyperventilation appears to be an inexpensive and safe method for increasing the conspicuity of abnormal areas of the blood-brain
immunohistochemical distribution of lymph capillaries and blood capillaries in the synovial membrane in cases of internal derangement of the temporomandibular the distribution of lymph capillaries and blood capillaries in the synovial membrane was examined immunohistologically with anti-human collagen iv antibody and anti-human von willebrand factor in 26 human temporomandibular joint (tmj) samples comprising discs with adjoining synovial membrane from 10 control tmjs and from 16 tmjs with internal three different distribution types were observed in the synovial in the control the occurrence of blood capillaries and lymph capillaries was in mildly hyperplastic lymph capillaries were observed just beneath the surface of the synovial whereas blood capillaries occurred in a little deeper layer of the synovial in a severely hyperplastic both lymph and blood capillaries were observed the present results suggest that the different distribution patterns of lymph capillaries and blood capillaries reflect the degree of synovitis but can not be attributed to specific clinical
analysis of the degree of qrs fusion necessary for its visual importance for the recognition of transient fixed fusion is the hallmark for the demonstration of transient the degree of accuracy of its recognition on the surface ecg is the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the ability to detect fusion in the qrs methods and while pacing the ventricles at a fixed a model of ventricular fusion was created by introducing late extra stimuli at a second in this the presence and degree of fusion are pacing sites were the rv outflow and left ventricle in various we analyzed 433 qrs complexes with different degrees of fusion (or no fusion) in 21 each qrs was by three investigators blinded to intracardiac recordings but having a reference qrs with no there was a statistically significant correlation between the degree of fusion and its fusion was detected with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of fusion was accurately detected in all configurations only when >22% of the qrs was in patients with organic left ventricular fusion was better recognized when the driving pacing site was the left ventricle than when it was a right ventricular the interobserver agreement was moderate between two pairs of observers and only fair between the remaining our results suggest that an accurate detection of ventricular fusion can only be accomplished when fusion occurs during a significant proportion of the qrs the potential lack of recognition of minor degrees of fusion may produce underdetection of transient

louis willems (1822-1907) and the immunization against contagious bovine an louis name is intimately linked with the history of prophylactic immunization in the nineteenth when he obtained his medical degree in 1849 contagious bovine pleuropneumonia or lung sickness was raging among the cattle population in most european as the son of a cattle fattener willems was confronted directly with the problem in his stables and decided to study the disease and to search for a remedy to combat the disease is caused by mycoplasma mycoides and subspecies but in the middle of the nineteenth century during the battle between the miasmatists and the many had doubts about its willems defended from the start the contagiousness of the disease and noticed that animals who had survived an infection did not contract it a second he demonstrated that inoculation of the serous fluid from the lungs or from the pleural cavity of affected animals into healthy cattle led to pronounced local when these inoculated animals later on came into contact with diseased cattle they were shown to be in his first trials he inoculated at the base of the tail or around the nostrils but this led to very severe reactions and frequently to he then started inoculating at the tip of the tail with much better most animals showed a more or less pronounced reaction at the inoculation site and about seven percent lost their tail partially or completely through but the mortality remained very the local reactions were caused by the etiological agent the lesions in the connective tissue of the tail showed much resemblance to those in the interlobular septa of the lungs and contained strong accumulations of serous the tip of the tail was obviously a good this was confirmed later by many authors and the procedure is still being used today in areas where the disease is still inoculation at other sites of the body such as the neck or the led to very severe reactions often followed by willems also demonstrated that local inoculation at the tip of the tail not only immunized the animals against infection via the respiratory tract resulting from contact with diseased but also against a second inoculation in the in the neck or material harvested from the inoculation site in the tail (so-called secondary could also be used as animals who showed no reaction to the first inoculation received a second one after a few immunization as a result of inoculation was proved repeatedly experimentally as well in by himself and by his as later in more recent failures were usually attributable to inoculation of already infected animals or to the use of badly stored or purulent inoculation during the incubation period did not provide concepts about the mechanisms of immunity were understandably vague and he considered pleuropneumonia as an affection of the whole body with process in the lung in case of natural following inoculation this process took place somewhere else and one created as it were a typical lung infection at another site of the through the introduction of the a of the whole body took place by which the blood and other organs became insensitive to this explained why the inoculation protected not only the inoculation but the whole willems thought that the infection did not spread from inoculated to non-inoculated this opinion was supported by some other workers in the field but opposed by the publication of his results created enormous interest in his country and in several countries commissions were trials were initiated and several foreign observers came to visit willems in in general his results were confirmed abroad at

the replicative impairment of vif- mutants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 correlates with an overall defect in viral dna the vif protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) is essential for the infectivity of virions produced by non-permissive the primary replicative defect of vif particles involves either synthesis or stability of viral but the mechanism of this defect is we report the results of a detailed analysis of hiv-1 dna synthesis by isogenic vif- mutants produced by different chronically infected h9 which exhibit different degrees of impairment in their replicative we found that the degree of impairment of dna synthesis by the mutant particles always correlated with the degree of their loss of this impairment appears to be with a defect increasing along with synthesis of longer viral dna we conclude that the primary replicative defect of vif- virus involves the capacity of the reverse transcription complex of hiv-1 to efficiently elongate viral resulting in an inability to produce full-length viral dna
cytokine evaluation in throat inflammatory cytokines have been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory in throat intracellular inflammatory cytokines have been detected from the sites of the present study aimed to evaluate serum cytokine levels of patients with throat infections and correlate them to the inflammatory parameters and type of significantly higher inflammatory cytokine levels (interleukin [il]-6 > 7 il-1 > 1 beta tumor necrosis factor alpha > 1 pg/ml) were detected in most of the patients as opposed to healthy clinical parameters of infection (fever > 38 degrees leukocytosis > white blood cells per cubic polymorphonuclear neutrophils > 75%) were significantly correlated with high levels of inflammatory mainly il-6 and tumor necrosis factor and to a lesser degree with il-1 no was found between the type of inflammation and cytokine the present study indicates a role of inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of throat infections and the need for an anti-inflammatory and anticytokine therapeutic
