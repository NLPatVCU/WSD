comparison of commercial isotonic fluids intravenously administered to rehydrate fasted holstein bullocks were used in this study to compare the effectiveness of five commercial parenteral fluids (saline 5%-glucose ringers and 1/2 and glucose combination solutions rg) in correcting the disturbances associated with dehydration induced by fasting for 48 these five commercial fluids (30 ml/kg) were given to bullocks with dehydration induced by fasting for 48 arterial and venous blood samples were taken before and at 360 and 24 hr after initiation of fluid fasting for 48 hr induced significant reductions in body weight and relative plasma volume of approximately and during the administration rpv showed a progressive increase from approximately after fasting to with no significantly differences between a rapid decrease of rpv when fluid administration has been finished was observed in the 5g and rg the results of the fluid administration trial showed that the 1/2 and glucose combination solution inhibited the acidification of the produced no change in the electrolyte balance of and induced a proper reabsorption rate of glucose in the and was therefore considered the best choice for the rehydration of adult cattle which have had no appetite for over 2
intrarenal production of angiotensin the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system plays a critical role in the paracrine regulation of renal hemodynamics and tubular transport much of the intrarenal angiotensin ii (ang ii) is formed locally as evidenced by intrarenal ang ii contents that are much greater than can be explained from the circulating ang ii intrarenal ang ii is formed from systemically delivered ang i and from intrarenally formed ang i derived from systemically delivered angiotensinogen as well as locally synthesized there is a regional distribution of intrarenal ang ii in that the medullary content per gram of tissue is four to five times higher than the cortical in most of the cortical ang ii is compartmentalized in the renal interstitial fluid and in the tubular proximal tubule cells contain all the components of the renin-angiotensin system necessary for synthesis and secretion of ang proximal tubule concentrations of ang ii as well as ang i and angiotensinogen support the concept that the proximal tubule cells secrete ang ii or precursors of ang ii into the tubular the intratubular concentrations of ang ii are in the nanomolar indicating a substantial capability to influence luminal ang ii receptors on the tubule cell much of the ang ii-dependent actions on tubular transport functions could be due to specific effects of locally synthesized ang ii on luminal ang ii experimental evidence shows that the intratubular ang ii concentrations are regulated independently of the circulating but the specific mechanisms responsible remain to be
lung surfactant in a cystic fibrosis animal increased alveolar phospholipid pool size without altered composition and surface tension function in cftrm1hgu/m1hgu progressive pulmonary dysfunction is a characteristic symptom of cystic fibrosis (cf) and is associated with functional impairment and biochemical alterations of surfactant phospholipids in the the fundamental question of whether surfactant alterations in the cf lung are secondary to the pulmonary damage or are present before initiation of chronic infection and inflammation has yet to be resolved in patients with cystic fibrosis but can now be addressed in cf mice that exhibit the basic defect in the a study was therefore undertaken to investigate the pool and function of lung surfactant in the non-infected cftrm1hgu/m1hgu the amount and composition of phospholipid classes and phosphatidylcholine molecular species were determined in bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) fluid and lavaged lungs by high performance liquid chromatography surfactant protein a (sp-a) levels in bal fluid were determined by elisa and surfactant for functional measurements was isolated from bal fluid by differential equilibrium and minimal surface tension of surfactant was assessed by the pulsating bubble surfactometer and c3h/he mice served as bal fluid of cftrm1hgu/m1hgu mice contained (95% confidence interval (ci) to mumol phospholipid and 259 (239 to 279) ng bal fluid of and c3h/he mice contained to to to and to mumol after correction for the different body weights of mouse phospholipid levels in bal fluid of cftrm1hgu/m1hgu mice were increased by 64 (52 to 60 (39 to 72 (45 to and 92 (49 to compared with the amount of sp-a in bal fluid and the composition of phospholipid as well as phosphatidylcholine molecular species in bal fluid and lung tissue was unchanged in cftrm1hgu/m1hgu mice compared with the increase in phospholipids in bal fluid of cftrm1hgu/m1hgu mice resulted from an increased fraction of large aggregates which exhibited normal surface tension in cftrm1hgu/m1hgu mice surfactant homeostasis is perturbed by an increased phospholipid pool in the alveolar
ethanol inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase transcription and post-transcriptional processes in the effects of ethanol (etoh) on post-transcriptional regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) in vivo has not been we examined the effect of etoh on inos and the production of the nitrate and nitrite anion (rni) in rat lung alveolar macrophages (am) in vivo when stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (lps) and dibutyryl cyclic amp sprague-dawley rats (225-250 g) (n = 5-7/gp) were given intratracheal lps mg/kg) or db-camp and 1 mg/kg) 30 min after etoh (4 intraperitoneally (ip)) or phosphate-buffered sterile saline (pbs) (5 ip) or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (pdtc 10 intratracheally) or 15 min after diethyl dithiocarbamate (detc) (5 at selected times after administration of lps or the animals were the lungs with the heart attached were removed and the lungs subjected to bronchoalveolar lavage the bal fluid was assayed for tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf alpha) and the bal fluid am were isolated and analyzed for inos mrna and protein with competitor-equalized polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and western the ex vivo incubates of am were assayed for rni and tnf lps and db-camp each increased inos mrna and protein in am and rni in the bal fluid and ex vivo incubates of the peak of the increase of inos mrna occurred at 2 hr for db-camp and 4 to 6 hr for only lps increased the concentrations of tnf alpha in bal fluid and ex vivo incubates of etoh attenuated lps-mediated up-regulation of inos mrna and tnf alpha and inos protein and rni produced by the in pretreatment of rats with etoh did not affect db-camp-mediated increases of inos mrna in am at any time but suppressed the amount of inos protein and rni produced in db-camp-stimulated but not attenuated lps-mediated up-regulation of inos mrna without effects on that produced by since etoh and but not suppressed lps-mediated but not db-camp-mediated transcription of we conclude that two distinct pathways exist for induction of inos mrna by these etoh and detc may inhibit the lps-mediated activation pathway by acting as since etoh inhibited db-camp-mediated increases in inos protein without affecting inos mrna etoh also acts at a post-transcriptional or translational site to inhibit inos protein in rat am in

changes in ldh isozyme pattern in uterine fluid of mice during early the total ldh activity in the uterine fluid of mice shows a rising trend from the first day after mating (dam-1) to the seventh day after mating this suggests that ldh activity increases as gestation during early m-isozymes of ldh show a predominance from dam-1 to dam-3 in the uterine luminal fluid of while h-isozyme shows a rising level from dam-5 (implantation day) and attains a maximum level at dam-7 (the post-implantation such shift of m-isozymes into h-isozymes of ldh (lactate dehydrogenase) during pre-implantation (dam-3) to post-implantation (dam-7) period changes the uterine luminal environment from anaerobic to aerobic condition which is more conducive for the normal implantation and survival of the growing
endothelin-1 secretion by alveolar macrophages in systemic endothelin-1 a potent fibroblast/smooth muscle cells has been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis lung disease since monocytes and macrophages are thought to be activated in we hypothesized that alveolar macrophages (am) and their precursors blood monocytes from patients with ssc produced more et-1 than cells from healthy et-1 and big et-1 concentrations were measured in in bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) fluids and in cell culture supernatants from monocytes and alveolar macrophages derived from 13 patients with definite ssc with lung involvement and from 10 control plasma and bal fluid et-1 and big et-1 levels were similar in both controls and patients with et-1 and big et-1 concentrations in unstimulated alveolar macrophage supernatants were similar in both in lps-stimulated alveolar macrophages from patients with ssc secreted higher amounts of et-1 and big et-1 than control et-1 and big et-1 concentrations in monocyte supernatants (either lps-stimulated or not) were not different in patients and these results show that am from patients with ssc are hyperresponsive to lps in vitro in terms of et-1 and big et-1 production and suggest that am could participate in vivo in the overproduction of this potentially profibrotic mediator in patients with

inhibitory effect of human hydrosalpingeal fluid on mouse preimplantation embryonic development is significantly reduced by the addition of implantation and pregnancy rates following in-vitro fertilization-embryo transfer are reduced in the presence of but the basis of the inhibition is we examined the effect of hydrosalpingeal fluid on preimplantation development of mouse embryos cultured in 100% hydrosalpingeal fluid were significantly inhibited developmentally as compared to embryos cultured in 100% defined which served as in embryos cultured in 50% hydrosalpingeal fluid/50% defined medium reached the blastocyst stage at the same frequency as the when lactate (final concentration 10 mm) was added to 100% hydrosalpingeal the percentage of cultured embryos that reached the blastocyst stage was significantly increased as compared to 100% hydrosalpingeal although the percentage was slightly lower than that observed for embryos cultured in the 100% defined a similar but less pronounced effect occurred when pyruvate was added to hydrosalpingeal these results do not support the concept that a potent embryotoxic agent is commonly present in hydrosalpingeal they are consistent with the notion that the inhibitory effect of hydrosalpingeal fluid on embryonic development is due to the absence of essential and that this deficiency can be largely corrected by the addition of energy
central venous catheter central venous access for the purpose of supplying parenteral nutrition to the pediatric age group requires a careful definition of the caloric estimated duration of and an assessment of available peripheral vein parenteral nutrition is limited by caloric density of the nutrient while peripherally inserted central catheters (picc) offers a new technology for accessing central veins while obviating the risk of central vein routes of central vein access are several and there are also a variety of catheters available for tunneled percutaneous placement of silicone rubber cuffed catheters via the subclavian vein approach is that technique we use most the risks of such access catheters include mechanical risks of venous thrombosis of the access and most importantly catheter related either at the exit the subcutaneous tunnel or or even generalized with a full knowledge of the spectrum of access access and safe total parenteral nutrition can be safely delivered to the children in
hyaluronic acid-modified bioadhesive liposomes as local drug effects of cellular and fluid dynamics on liposome retention at target bioadhesive in which hyaluronic acid is the surface-anchored bioadhesive are being tested in vitro in order to evaluate their the first part of the binding to monolayers of cells modeling the in vivo designated sites under static was reported in a previous this communication reports the results of the second and third parts of the which consist of evaluating the retention of bound liposomes in the face of tissue-related events such as cell and and under fluid the in vivo-designated binding sites for the bioadhesive liposomes were as by monolayers of the a431 cell line a setup for perfusing a culture flask containing a monolayer of cells was devised for measuring the retention under fluid the major findings (1) over a selected tested period of 28 the cell cultures mimicked the tissue-related events described whether they did or did not receive a dose of over the same period and throughout these the bioadhesive liposomes remained bound at equilibrium-like in the range of ng lipid/10(5) (2) fluid flowed over a cell monolayer dosed with bioadhesive liposomes swept away part of the this loss was due mostly to that fraction of the dose which was in excess of the binding capacity of the and occurred over the first 15 min of the cell monolayer retained the bound at equilibrium-like levels and with no further even for the longest flow period tested (45 min of continuous flow) and under a flow rate of this together with previous shows that the hyaluronic acid-modified liposomes meet all parts of the bioadhesivity we therefore find merit in their further
mathematical model of an adult human atrial the role of k+ currents in we have developed a mathematical model of the human atria myocyte based on averaged voltage-clamp data recorded from isolated single our model consists of a hodgkin-huxley-type equivalent circuit for the coupled with a fluid compartment which accounts for changes in ionic concentrations in the cytoplasm as well as in the sarcoplasmic this formulation can reconstruct action potential data that are representative of recordings from a majority of human atrial cells in our laboratory and therefore provides a biophysically based account of the underlying ionic this work is based in part on a previous model of the rabbit atrial myocyte published by our group and was motivated by differences in some of the repolarizing currents between human and rabbit we have therefore given particular attention to the sustained outward k+ current which putatively has a prominent role in determining the duration of the human atrial action our results demonstrate that the action potential shape during the peak and plateau phases is determined primarily by transient outward k+ i(sus) and l-type ca2+ current and that the role of i(sus) in the human atrial action potential can be modulated by the baseline sizes of i(sus) and the rapid delayed rectifier k+ as a our simulations suggest that the functional role of i(sus) can depend on the physiological/disease state of the

short periods of oscillating fluid pressure directed at a titanium-bone interface in rabbits lead to bone fluctuating high fluid pressures have been reported in pseudojoints after total hip and may be present throughout the effective joint when the pressure extends locally to the bone implant we hypothesized that it might have led to bone we developed an experimental implant model to study whether oscillating fluid applied during 2 hours a can lead to osteolysis at the bone implant 12 mature rabbits received a titanium which was allowed to fluid pressure was applied to a specific area of the titanium bone interface at the periosteal side of the cortex in 6 of the the applied during 2 hours a day for 14 oscillated between 70 and 150 mm with a frequency of bone resorption was not found in any of the control but it occurred under 4 implants exposed to fluid pressure (p = exact localized osteolytic lesions had with evidence of osteocyte death in the surrounding cortical in 1 of the 2 specimens without there was evidence of fluid leakage into the soft in 4 specimens (3 with and 1 without bone formation was observed at the endosteal side opposite to the pressure this did not occur in the no signs of infection were our findings indicate that oscillating fluid even when present only during short can lead to osteolysis and may be a cause of prosthetic endosteal bone apposition may be a result of the interstitial flow that was giving false signals of mechanical load to the
particle motion within in vitro models of stenosed internal carotid and left anterior descending coronary asymmetric 75% and 95% area transparent sylgard stenotic models were operated under internal carotid artery (ica) [womersley re(mean) =213 and and re(peak)=734 and respectively] and left anterior descending coronary artery (lad) flow wave forms re(mean)=59 and and re(peak)= 137 and respectively) to evaluate the effect of these conditions on particle residence times downstream of the amberlite particles 400 microm) were added to the fluid to simulate platelets and their motion through the stenotic region and were traced using a laser light sheet flow visualization method with pseudo-color two-dimensional (2d) particle motions were recorded and particle washout in the stenotic throat and downstream section were computed for all all four model cases demonstrated jetting through the stenosis which followed an arching pattern around a large separation zone considerable mixing was observed within these vortex regions during high flow particle washout profiles showed no clear trend between the degrees of stenosis although particles downstream of the stenoses tended to remain longer for lad the critical washout cycle (1% of particles remaining downstream of the was longer for the 95% stenoses cases under each flow condition due to the larger protected region immediately downstream and maximal for the lad 95% results of this study suggest that particle residence times downstream of 75% and 95% stenoses (approximately 3-6 s for ica and approximately 8-10 s for lad) exceed the minimum time for platelet adhesion (approximately 1 s) for at least 1% of cells may be sufficient to initiate thrombus formation under resting
cytokines in nasal fluids from school children with seasonal allergic allergic rhinitis is a particularly good model for studies of cytokine production in in this study the occurrence of the cytokines il-10 and ifn-gamma as well as the soluble receptor for il-4 in nasal lavage fluids were assayed in 38 school with seasonal allergic and 19 healthy non-atopic using highly sensitive enzyme il-4 levels in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were markedly increased in comparison with those in non-atopic controls or in atopic patients before the start of the pollen in but not in the atopic levels of ifn-gamma and il-5 were significantly higher in specimens obtained during the pollen season than in those obtained outside the the il-4/ifn-gamma ratios were significantly higher in atopic than in non-atopic subjects and further increased in atopic patients during the in addition to elevated levels of il-10 were observed in association with seasonal following treatment with a topical steroid (budesonide) there was a statistically significant increase of the levels of soluble il-4 these findings indicate that nonatopic and atopic individuals react to pollen exposure with distinct cytokine patterns in agreement with the th1/th2 topical steroids may possibly decrease inflammation by increasing the formation of soluble il-4
human an antimicrobial peptide of urogenital antimicrobial peptides are widely distributed mediators of innate host defense in animals and a 36 amino acid antimicrobial peptide belonging to the defensin and named human beta-defensin-1 was purified recently from hemodialysate but its tissue sources were not by northern we found the highest concentrations of hbd-1 mrna in the kidney and the female reproductive in situ hybridization localized the hbd-1 mrna in the epithelial layers of the loops of distal and the collecting ducts of the kidney and the epithelial layers of the and fallopian tubes in the female reproductive using a novel technique designed to detect cationic peptides in we recovered several forms of hbd-1 ranging in length from 36 to 47 amino acid (aa) residues and differing from each other by amino terminal the total concentration of hbd-1 forms in voided urine was estimated at 10-100 with individual variations in the total amount of hbd-1 peptides and the relative proportion of hbd-1 multiple forms of hbd-1 (size 36-47 aa) were also found in the blood bound to carrier macromolecules that released the peptide under acid and in vaginal mucosal secretions and 44 by hbd-1 was located in the kidney within the lumen of the loops of but no intracellular storage sites were identified in renal or female reproductive recombinant hbd-1 forms and 42 aa) and natural hbd-1 forms were antimicrobial to laboratory and clinical strains of escherichia coli at micromolar hbd-1 activity was not changed appreciably by low but was inhibited by high salt some of the hbd-1 peptides retained their activity against coli in unconcentrated (low conductance) and the 36 aa form was microbicidal even in normal (high conductance) production of hbd-1 in the urogenital tract could contribute to local antimicrobial
effect of pressure on the catalytic activity of subtilisin carlsberg suspended in compressed we studied the effect of pressure up to 300 bar on the catalytic efficiency of subtilisin carlsberg suspended in compressed near-critical near-critical carbon dioxide and tert-amyl at constant temperature and fixed enzyme increasing pressure lowered the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme in all the resulting in positive activation delta the delta v# values in compressed propane and in tert-amyl alcohol were similar and larger in magnitude than the value reported in the literature for the same reaction in an aqueous although within the range of typical delta v# values in aqueous in the near-critical the delta v# were much an increase in pressure of only 200 bar causing a sixfold decrease in the catalytic efficiency of subtilisin in carbon these data should reflect the proximity of ethane and carbon dioxide to the critical and the resulting condensation of solvent molecules about the yielding negative solute partial molar

correction of pressure waveforms recorded by fluid-filled catheter recording a new method using a transfer pressure measuring systems using fluid-filled catheters can result in the recording of distorted pressure it results in phase overestimation of systolic to a lesser of diastolic we designed and evaluated a method to correct this pressure waveform distortion using an appropriate transfer equation obtained from the dynamic response of the fluid-filled this transfer equation is based on the principle that a fluid-filled catheter recording system is considered as an underdamped dynamic system fully characterized by its natural frequency (omega n) and damping ratio pressure simultaneously recorded in vitro or in vivo by a fluid-filled catheter (pc) and a micromanometer-tipped catheter were used to validate the dynamic response of the catheter used was obtained from a fastflush the corrected signal (ppred) was obtained using omega zeta and the following transfer d2pc/dt2 + 2 omega n zeta dpc/dt + omega n 2pc = c ppred (t) after correction of ppred was using a linear with pref taken as our results showed that ppred was fitted to pref with excellent coefficient correlation the mean error and the standard error of estimate were respectively mmhg and this new method can convert the distorted pressure waveforms transmitted by any fluid-filled catheters into high-fidelity it suppresses the phase delay and the over-estimation of systolic pressure induced by fluid-filled
paf levels in saliva are regulated by inflammatory platelet activating factor a powerful inflammatory phospholipid has been detected in normal human saliva and found to be increased in the cellular source of paf in saliva is controversial although several data suggest an origin related to the presence of inflammatory paf levels in biological fluids are regulated by paf-producing cells and by the paf-degrading although in normal human saliva acetylhydrolase activity is very no information is available on the levels of this enzyme in inflammatory conditions of the the aim of our study was to assess the contribution of inflammatory cells to the levels of paf in saliva in normal subjects and in patients with paf was measured by radioimmunoassay (ria) in mixed uncentrifuged saliva and in cell-free saliva from healthy before and after tooth and in patients with in healthy subjects paf levels were significantly higher in whole saliva than in centifuged saliva +/- +/- p < a significant increase in the amount of paf was detected in whole but not in centifuged 2 h after tooth in patients with periodontitis paf levels were not different from those of healthy individuals when using centrifuged saliva but were significantly higher when using uncentrifuged exogenous radiolabelled paf was degraded much more rapidly by the saliva of periodontitis patients than by that of normal in our study shows that inflammatory cells regulate the levels of paf in saliva contributing to its production and the differential degradation of paf in normal and inflammatory saliva highlights the absolute need of a series of methodological precautions when performing studies on salivary
a psychophysical study of discomfort produced by repeated filling of the urinary psychophysical studies were performed in 10 female volunteers using urinary bladder distension (ubd) as a visceral stimulus methodology was similar to that used clinically for obtaining cystometrograms with a fixed-rate (100 cc/min normal saline) filling of the urinary occasional pauses and simultaneous measure of bladder pressure using a catheter-transducer during bladder subjects were asked to report sensations by verbal report and by using an visual-analog-scale sensations evoked by ubd were generally localized to the suprapubic ubd produced cardiovascular responses which increased with repeated sensation intensity increased with repeated ubds as indicated by global pain intravesical pressure and volume correlated with sensation the volume of distending fluid needed to produce a report of discomfort was highly variable from trial to trial and did not change significantly with repeated the intravesical pressure which produced a report of discomfort was less variable and significantly decreased with repeated the change in intravesical pressure and volume needed to produce discomfort was inversely correlated with initial intravesical pressure similar to findings in other organ these findings demonstrate that repeated presentations of a visceral stimulus may lead to an increase in physiological and perceptual responses to
