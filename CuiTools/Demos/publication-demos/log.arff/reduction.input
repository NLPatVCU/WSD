measurement of total body water content in using deuterium oxide to measure total body water (tbw) content in using deuterium oxide (d2o) six 8- to 10-year-old healthy untrained mixed-breed weighing (mean +/-sd) +/- after a 12-hour nonfeeding 6 horses were given d2o g/kg of body weight) via nasogastric blood samples were collected from a preplaced indwelling jugular vein catheter prior to and 1 to and 24 hours after administration of blood samples were centrifuged and plasma was collected and stored at -70 c until the d2o content in plasma was measured by zinc reduction to deuterium the resulting gas was using an isotope ratio mass deuterium oxide was rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of all and reached peak (mean +/- sd) plasma concentration +/- 163 delta d/ml or parts/thousand) 1 hour after plasma concentration decreased slowly during the next 2 to 3 then remained statistically constant from 2 to 5 hours (early plateau phase) and 3 to 7 hours (late plateau phase) after mean +/- sem tbw content was +/- ml/kg of body weight) for the early plateau phase and +/- ml/kg of body weight) for the late plateau deuterium oxide dilution appears to be of value for measurement of tbw content in and has a 4-hour plateau equilibration of d2o with large intestinal water may be the reason for the prolonged equilibrium time and plateau effect seen in these clinical deuterium oxide appears safe and efficacious for determining tbw content in horses and may be helpful for determining changes in tbw content during exercise and
redox-dependent conformational changes are common structural features of cytochrome c from various discrepant results from x-ray crystallographic and physicochemical studies on the conformations of the two redox states of cytochrome c raise important questions about the nature of redox-dependent conformational changes and whether differences are common structural features of various cytochrome c comparative studies of cytochrome c from 10 species and yeast) in aqueous solutions were carried out using fourier transform infrared (ft-ir) the second-derivative analysis revealed similar conformational changes in all 10 species upon reduction of the heme iron regardless of the differences in the amino acid the redox-dependent changes involve the amide i regions ascribed to extended and alpha-helix three species and pig) with identical amino acid sequences displayed nearly identical infrared spectra for the oxidized and reduced which rules out the possible contribution of experimental these results show unequivocally that redox-dependent conformational changes are common structural feature of various cytochrome c species and demonstrate the usefulness of ft-ir spectroscopy as a quick and inexpensive tool in comparative studies of functionally related conformational changes of
extracellular reduction of selenite by a novel marine photosynthetic a novel purple nonsulfur bacterium strain which has resistance to over 5 mm was isolated from a marine an initial concentration of mm added to the was decreased to under mm within 5 the color of the cell suspension turned red within 2 the red coloration gradually decreased and black precipitates appeared during 2 weeks of under these two main types of deposit were formed these deposits were thought to contain red amorphous selenium and black vitreous the selenite reduction to elemental selenium in this bacterium was induced by the introduction of light and l-malic acid under anaerobic these results suggest that selenite reduction is coupled with photosynthesis and l-malic acid can serve as the indirect electron donor for its phylogenetic analysis based on the 16s rdna sequence showed that nkpb0360619 belongs to the alpha subdivision of proteobacteria and is classified into the rhodobacter the highest similarity of was observed with
a novel antioxidant gene from mycobacterium tuberculosis [published erratum appears in j exp med 1998 jan among the major antimicrobial products of macrophages are reactive intermediates of the oxidation of nitrogen (rni) and the reduction of oxygen selection of recombinants in acidified nitrite led to the cloning of a novel from a pathogenic clinical isolate of mycobacterium expression of noxr1 conferred upon escherichia coli and mycobacterium smegmatis enhanced ability to resist rni and whether the bacteria were exposed to exogenous compounds in medium or to endogenous products in these studies provide the first identification of an rni resistance mechanism in point to a new mechanism for resistance to and raise the possibility that inhibition of the noxr1 pathway might enhance the ability of macrophages to control
nitro reduction as an electronic switch for bioreductive drug it is well known that the reduction of aromatic nitro groups can give rise to toxic and that net nitro reduction by one-electron reductases can usually be inhibited by there has been much interest in utilizing this biotransformation to activate drugs in hypoxic regions of but no clinically useful compound has yet nitroreductive activation of prodrugs by oxygen-insensitive (and oxygen-sensitive) reductases is also of current interest because of new methods for introducing specific nitroreductases into tumors as antibody-enzyme conjugates or by gene in most of the compounds investigated cytotoxicity appears to be due to reactive nitroso or hydroxylamine reduction products arising from the nitro group it is argued that there is greater scope for designing potent and selective nitro compounds by using the nitro group as an electronic switch to activate a latent reactive moiety elsewhere in the examples of this approach include the nitro(hetero)aromatic mustards sn nsc 646394) in which the nitro group controls the reactivity of a nitrogen mustard to which it is directly and the nitro(hetero)aromatic methylquaternary (nmq) mustards sn nsc 658926) in which reduction of the nitro group triggers fragmentation of the molecule to release a reactive aliphatic nitrogen many of these compounds show very high selectivity for hypoxic cells in some are also active against hypoxic cells in and provide large tumor growth delays when combined with tumor blood flow inhibitors such as acid these prodrug designs also have potential for releasing effectors other than nitrogen which opens up many possibilities for use of nitro compounds as tumor-selective
restoration of the spinal canal by the internal fixator and it has been observed that after reduction of an unstable vertebral treated either conservatively or the encroachment of the spinal canal remaining after reduction can decrease considerably with a series of 31 each with a set of ct scans taken immediately after surgery and after implant removal was assessed using computer-aided the mean initial narrowing of the spinal canal was through surgery this was decreased by leaving a remaining deficit of after implant 15 months after trauma and the area of the spinal canal increased a further leaving a remaining deficit of only comparing the values of the spinal canal for t12-l5 directly after surgery and after implant an almost identical degree of restoration for each level can be this additional and gradual restoration of the spinal canal is termed this study demonstrates that a residual postoperative narrowing of the spinal canal of up to 25% can be provided there is no initial neurologic
the reduction potential of cytochrome b5 is modulated by its exposed heme when the reduction potential of cytochrome b5 is measured with the aid of several different surface-modified electrodes that function on the basis of electrostatic interactions with the the resultant values have been consistently more positive (40-100 mv) than the reduction potentials measured with potentiometric in this we report that the heme edge containing the exposed heme a heme and a heme and which constitutes part of the surface of cytochrome modulates its reduction the positive shifts observed in the voltammetric measurements appear to originate from the formation of a complex between cytochrome b5 and the modified electrode surface which (a) neutralizes the charge on the heme propionate located on the exposed heme edge and (b) lowers the dielectric of the exposed heme microenvironment by excluding water from the complex factors which result in the destabilization of the positive charge on the ferric heme with respect to the neutral ferrous the observed positive which is induced by complexation at the electrode may indicate that similar shifts in the reduction potential of cytochrome b5 occur when it forms a complex with physiological prior to electron the effect of the value of the dielectric constant on the reduction potential of cytochrome b5 was corroborated by preparing the v45l/v61l double mutant whose reduction potential was measured to be 50 mv more negative than the value measured for the wild type the negative shift in the reduction potential of the mutant protein was explained by the increased accessibility of water to the heme binding as observed in its x-ray crystal
involvement of products of the nrfefg genes in the covalent attachment of haem c to a novel cysteine-lysine motif in the cytochrome c552 nitrite reductase from escherichia cytochrome c552 is the terminal component of the formate-dependent nitrite reduction pathway of escherichia in addition to four haem-binding characteristic of c-type the n-terminal region of nrfa includes a peptides generated by digesting the cytochrome from wild-type bacteria with cyanogen bromide followed by trypsin were analysed by on-line hplc ms/ms in parent scanning a strong signal at mass corresponding to was generated by fragmentation of a peptide of mass 1312 that included the sequence neither this signal nor the haem-containing peptide of mass 1312 was detected in parallel experiments with cytochrome that had been purified from a transformant unable to synthesize nrff and this is consistent with our previous report that nrfe and nrfg (but not nrff) are essential for formate-dependent nitrite redox titrations clearly revealed the presence of high and low mid-point potential redox the best fit to the experimental data is for three n=1 components with mid-point redox potentials (ph of +45 mv (21% of the total absorbance -90 mv (36% of the total) and -210mv (43% of the plasmids in which the lysine codon of the cysteine-lysine was changed to the histidine codon cat (to create a fifth haem c-binding or to the isoleucine and leucine att and were unable to transform a nrf deletion mutant to nrf+ or to restore formate-dependent nitrite reduction to the the presence of a 50 kda periplasmic c-type cytochrome was confirmed by staining proteins separated by sds-page for covalently bound but the methyl-viologen-dependent nitrite reductase activities associated with the mutated although still were far lower than that of the native the combined data establish not only that there is a haem group bound covalently to the cysteine-lysine motif of cytochrome c552 but also that one or more products of the last three genes of the nrf operon are essential for the haem ligation to this
investigating the mechanism of electron transfer to the binuclear center in cu-heme novel experimental evidence is presented further supporting the hypothesis starting with resting oxidized cytochrome c the internal electron transfer to the oxygen binding site is kinetically the reduction of the enzyme was followed spectroscopically and in the presence of no or used as trapping ligands for reduced cytochrome ruthenium hexamine was used as a spectroscopically silent electron consistent with the high combination rate constant for reduced cytochrome no proved to be a very efficient trapping while co did the results are discussed in view of two alternative (thermodynamic and kinetic) hypotheses of control of electron transfer to the binuclear fulfilling the prediction of the kinetic control i) the reduction of cytochrome a3 and ligation are synchronous and proceed at the intrinsic rate of cytochrome a3 ii) the measured rate of formation of the nitrosyl derivative is independent of the concentration of both the reductant and
