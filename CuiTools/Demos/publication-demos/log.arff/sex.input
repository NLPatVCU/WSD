specialists achieve better outcomes than generalists for lung cancer surgery [see a push toward care provided by generalists as opposed to specialists has occurred in the health-care marketplace despite a lack of provider specific outcome the objective of this study was to determine whether the outcome of patients undergoing lung cancer surgery is different between general surgeons (gss) and thoracic surgeons examination of data from a state-wide severity-adjusted administrative hospital discharge patients undergoing lung cancer resection in all nonfederal acute care hospitals within south main outcome mortality by specialty adjusted for case from 1991 to resections for lung cancer were performed in south one hundred thirty-seven cases were excluded because surgeons did not meet the predefined criteria for board leaving resections for one-half of lobectomies and nearly 60% of pneumonectomies were performed by patients were similar in and the proportion in each severity of illness mortality was significantly higher in patients who underwent lobectomy by gss vs tss vs and in patients with extreme comorbidities vs or age >65 years vs seventy percent of tss performed > 10 cases in the whereas 75% of gss performed <10 logistic regression analysis failed to identify any significant variable that might explain the mortality differences between tss and mortality is lower for lung cancer resection when the surgery is performed by a
alternative splicing of the d2 dopamine receptor messenger ribonucleic acid is modulated by activated sex steroid receptors in the mmq prolactin cell the two isoforms of the d2 dopamine receptor are generated by alternative splicing of the exon 6 of the premessenger rna changing the length of the third cytoplasmic loop involved in the coupling to g in the mmq prl cell sex steroid hormones modulated the proportion of the two d2 receptor under controlled culture 17beta-estradiol (e2) strongly favored the production of the long isoform of d2 mrna over the short whereas both isoforms were equally abundant when culture medium was hormone in the presence of progesterone e2 action was and equal amounts of each d2 receptor isoform were produced in the hormone treatments never modified either the total amount of d2 receptor mrna and d2 receptor binding sites or d2 receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl specific antagonists demonstrated that the activity of each hormone depended on their nuclear inhibitors of gene transcription or translation also showed that their activity required protein the expression of the short d2 receptor isoform was never even at the single cell analysis of the intron sequence flanking alternative exon 6 showed that only the upstream intron presented two sequence tracts known to be targets for splicing taken these results provide converging evidence for a physiologically relevant mechanism by which sex steroid receptors could regulate the expression of a splicing factor favoring the production of the long dopamine d2 receptor
