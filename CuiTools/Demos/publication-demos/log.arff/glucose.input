glucose transporters of the glomerulus and the implications for diabetic several glucose transporters have recently been identified in and in cultured glomerular these include the facilitative glucose transporter isoforms gluts 3 and and sodium-glucose cotransport activity with characteristics of gluts 3 and 4 are all high low facilitative glucose transporters which typically would be saturated at or near physiologic glucose the sglt transporter of mesangial cells is also a high affinity transporter which similarly could be saturated under normal glucose this suggests that in order for mesangial cells to take up excessive quantities of glucose in changes in glucose transporter translocation or activity may be recent investigations discovered positive-feedback regulation of the mesangial cell glut1 transporter by and a regulatory role for glut1 in glucose metabolism and extracellular matrix future investigations of glucose transporters in the pathogenesis of diabetic renal disease will now likely proceed in multiple including but not limited (1) examination of their regulation by growth factors implicated in diabetic and the resultant effects on ecm (2) determination of the mechanisms by which glut1 regulates the expression of aldose and other genes in the mesangial and (3) suppression of glucose transporters in attempts to prevent high glucose-induced diabetic
effect of dietary sodium on insulin sensitivity in sedentary increased dietary sodium intake has been associated with an increase in blood pressure as well as a decrease in insulin-mediated glucose disposal in young healthy the purpose of this study was to determine whether dietary sodium intake is associated with changes in oral glucose insulin and blood pressure in overweight eight older +/- mean +/- overweight +/- body mildly hypertensive (151 +/- 8/82 +/- 2 mm hg) patients with a fasting plasma glucose < mmol/l were studied after 2 weeks on low (3 g/day) and 2 weeks on high (10 g/day) sodium to examine carbohydrate metabolism we performed a 2 h oral glucose tolerance test and a two-dose (240 and 600 pmol/m2/min) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp at the end of each sodium high sodium intake was associated with a significantly greater urinary sodium excretion (364 +/- 45 mmol/day v 112 +/- 21 p < the increase in dietary sodium from low to high did not result in significant differences in fasting plasma glucose +/- v +/- p = or insulin +/- v +/- p = levels or in the glucose +/- v +/- p = and insulin +/- v +/- p = areas determined during the oral glucose tolerance there was no effect of dietary sodium on insulin-mediated glucose disposal at low +/- v +/- p = or high +/- v +/- p = insulin infusion our findings suggest in insulin resistant increased dietary sodium does not affect either glucose or insulin responses during an oral glucose tolerance test or glucose disposal during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic
labeling of recombinant protein for nmr global and specific labeling of the rat liver fructose methods for the efficient use of the 13c-labeled glucose and in the production of recombinant protein were developed to provide the large amount of sample required for nmr the nutrient requirements were reduced by determining the minimum amount of these metabolites needed during both the growth and the induction phases of the bl21(de3) and newly constructed bl21(de3) histidine auxotrophic escherichia coli these methods were developed using the separate bisphosphatase domain of rat liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/ which is expressed to high levels in the pet3a/bl21 (de3) bacterial use of the optimized expression methods reduced the requirements for the labeled glucose and by 90 and the savings realized by use of the minimized media and modified induction protocols were obtained without significant reduction of the yield of purified comprehensive study of the bisphosphatase domain by nmr spectroscopy requires large amounts of protein because of its low solubility and the short lifetime (2-3 days) of the nmr the significant reduction in the costs of labeled protein samples realized by the optimized expression methods can meet these sample requirements in a cost-effective and allow nmr studies of the bisphosphatase domain to
retrobiosynthetic nmr studies with 13c-labeled formation of gallic acid in plants and the biosynthesis of gallic acid was studied in cultures of the fungus phycomyces blakesleeanus and in leaves of the tree rhus fungal cultures were grown with [1-13c]glucose or with a mixture of unlabeled glucose and young leaves of typhina were kept in an incubation chamber and were supplied with a solution containing a mixture of unlabeled glucose and [u-13c6]glucose via the leaf isotope distributions in isolated gallic acid and aromatic amino acids were analyzed by one-dimensional 1h and 13c nmr a quantitative analysis of the complex isotopomer composition of metabolites was obtained by deconvolution of the 13c13c coupling multiplets using numerical simulation this approach required the accurate analysis of heavy isotope chemical shift effects in a variety of different isotopomers and the analysis of long range 13c13c coupling the resulting isotopomer patterns were interpreted using a retrobiosynthetic approach based on a comparison between the isotopomer patterns of gallic acid and the data show that both in the fungus and in the plant all carbon atoms of gallic acid are biosynthetically equivalent to carbon atoms of the carboxylic group of gallic acid is derived from the carboxylic group of an early intermediate of the shikimate pathway and not from the side chain of phenylalanine or it follows that the committed precursor of gallic acid is an intermediate of the shikimate pathway prior to prephenate or most probably a formation of gallic acid via the lignin caffeic or 5-trihydroxycinnamic acid can be ruled out as major pathways in the fungus and in young leaves of the incorporation of uniformly 13c-labeled glucose followed by quantitative nmr analysis of isotopomer patterns is suggested as a general method for biosynthetic as shown by the plant this approach is also applicable to systems with low incorporation
a temporary local energy pool coupled to neuronal fluctuations of extracellular lactate levels in rat brain monitored with rapid-response enzyme-based a successfully developed enzyme-based lactate microsensor with rapid response time allows the direct and continuous in vivo measurement of lactic acid concentration with high temporal resolution in brain extracellular the fluctuations coupled to neuronal activity in extracellular lactate concentration were explored in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of the rat brain after electrical stimulation of the perforant extracellular glucose and oxygen levels were also detected simultaneously by coimplantation of a fast-response glucose sensor and an oxygen to provide novel information of trafficking of energy substances in real time related to local neuronal the results first give a comprehensive picture of complementary energy supply and use of lactate and glucose in the intact brain in response to acute neuronal the brain tissue shifts immediately to significant energy supply by a local temporary fuel is established behind the blood-brain evidenced by increased extracellular lactate the pool can be depleted up to 28% in 10-12 by acute neuronal use after stimulation and can be replenished in approximately 20 glutamate-stimulated astrocytic glycolysis and the increase of regional blood flow may regulate the lactate concentration of the pool in different time scales to maintain local energy
cortisol reduces hippocampal glucose metabolism in normal but not in glucocorticoids are known to play a role in the regulation of peripheral glucose mobilization and although several animal studies have shown that hippocampal glucose metabolism is reduced acutely and chronically by the action of corticosterone and that excess glucocorticoids are harmful to hippocampal little is known about the central effects of glucocorticoids in the in this study we examined the brain glucose utilization (cmrglu) response to hydrocortisone (cortisol) in seven normal elderly and eight disease (ad) on 2 separate immediately after the administration of a bolus of either 35 mg hydrocortisone or we administered after a 35-min radiotracer uptake positron emission tomography (pet) images were pet cmrglu images were analyzed using two an image transformation that allowed analyses across cases on a voxel by voxel and an anatomically based region of interest method that used coregistered magnetic resonance imaging both image analysis methods yielded similar identifying relative to a specific hippocampal cmrglu reduction in response to the hydrocortisone challenge that was restricted to the normal the region of interest technique showed cmrglu reductions of 16% and 12% in the right and left blood collected during the pet scans for the normal a rise in plasma glucose starting approximately 25 min after hydrocortisone the ad group did not show this baseline cortisol was elevated in the ad but the clearance of hydrocortisone was not different between the in these data show that among normal individuals in the presence of a pharmacological dose of the glucose utilization of the hippocampus is specifically and serum glucose levels based in part on other we offer the interpretation that glucocorticoid-mediated regulation of glucose transport is altered in and this may underlie both the hippocampal insensitivity to cortisol and the failure in these patients to mount a peripheral glucose as our findings could reflect an altered state of the ad we interpret our results as preliminary with respect to evidence for metabolic abnormalities in the results suggest the continued study of the hydrocortisone challenge as a test of hippocampal

heart failure to assess whether blood ketone bodies are increased in congestive heart failure thirteen patients with chf and 11 cardiac patients without chf took part in the blood acetoacetate and b-hydroxybutyrate levels and the pertinent metabolic and hormonal milieu were measured during 20 h fast and after 2 h glucose the averaged blood ketone body and free fatty acid levels were significantly higher during the fast and also remained higher after glucose infusion in patients with chf than in the control the areas under ketone body concentration time curve over the last 8 h of the fast were 3522 +/- 662 mumol l-1 h-1 (se) and 1789 +/- 192 mumol l-1 h-1 in patients with and without respectively (p = circulating noradrenaline and growth hormone were higher but glucagon lower in patients with chf than in the controls (p < for all differences) whereas the glucose and insulin concentrations were comparable in the study at the time of peak ketonaemia the glucagon-to-insulin ratio was lower in patients with chf than in patients without chf (p = these data suggest that severe chf is a ketosis-prone augmented supply of free fatty acids for ketogenesis due to increased stress hormone-related lipolysis is one likely
cloning and expression of a gene cluster encoding three subunits of membrane-bound gluconate dehydrogenase from erwinia cypripedii atcc 29267 in escherichia we have cloned the gene cluster encoding three subunits of membrane-bound gluconate dehydrogenase (gadh) from erwinia cypripedii atcc 29267 in escherichia coli by performing a direct-expression the positive clone converted d-gluconate to 2-keto-d-gluconate (2kdg) in the culture nucleotide sequence analysis of the gadh clone revealed that the cloned fragment contained the complete structural genes for a 68-kda dehydrogenase a 47-kda cytochrome c and a 24-kda subunit of unknown function and that the genes were clustered with the same transcriptional comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences and the nh2-terminal sequences determined for the purified protein indicated that the cytochrome and 24-kda subunits contained typical signal peptides of and 42 amino the molecular masses of the processed subunits deduced from the nucleotide sequences and 20 kda) coincided well with the molecular masses of subunits estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel in cypripedii and recombinant the gadh was constitutively formed and the activity of gadh was enhanced more than twofold by addition of d-gluconate to the the holoenzyme glucose dehydrogenase of coli was reconstituted by addition of pyrroloquinoline quinone to the culture and the conversion of d-glucose or d-gluconate to 2kdg by recombinant coli harboring the cloned gadh gene was attempted in batch the conversion yields for d-glucose were mol of 2kdg/mol of d-glucose after 16 h of and those for d-gluconate were mol of 2kdg/mol of d-gluconate after 12 h of
escherichia coli is unable to produce pyrroloquinoline quinone many bacteria can synthesize the cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone a cofactor of several including glucose dehydrogenase among the enteric klebsiella pneumoniae has been shown to contain the genes required for pqq escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium were thought to be unable to synthesize pqq but it has been reported that strain a derivative of coli can synthesize pqq after mutation and can oxidize glucose to gluconate via the gcd/pqq pathway turlin & j gen microbiol we have re-investigated this claim and conclude that it is most likely (i) strain isolated originally by biville and was unable to synthesize a holo-enzyme gcd unless pqq was supplied to the growth no gcd activity could be detected in membrane (ii) the amount of pqq detected in the growth medium of ef260 was very low and not very different from that found in a medium with its parent strain or in a medium containing no (iii) ef260 cells were unable to produce gluconate from glucose via the pqq/gcd (iv) introduction of a deletion in eliminating did not affect glucose this suggested a pathway for glucose metabolism other than the pqq/gcd (v) glucose uptake and metabolism in ef260 involved a low-affinity transport system of unknown followed most likely by phosphorylation via it is concluded that coli cannot synthesize pqq and that it lacks genes required for pqq
dna synthesis of cultured mesothelial cells in a high permeable to understand the mechanism of regeneration of the mesothelial cell in a high permeable in vitro experiments with cultured mesothelial cells were carried out using a type i collagen-coated multititer prior to cell each plate was filled with 100 microl of glucose solution at concentrations of 30 90 and 150 and minimum essential medium after immersion for one to five weeks at 37 degrees mesothelial cells were seeded at a density of 3 x then glucose was added at varying final concentrations between 0 and 150 mmol/l and/or albumin was added at a final concentration of 2 after days 2 and dna synthesis was measured by incorporation of there was no significant difference of dna synthesis between groups with and without one-week glucose immersion when mesothelial cells were cultured with only 10% suppression of dna synthesis at 2 g/dl of albumin was seen no matter what concentration of glucose supplement was without a high concentration of dna synthesis was dose-dependent on the longer the immersion the lesser the it is speculated that process of glycation with collagen may relate to growth of mesothelial

cryopreservation of mouse embryos affects later embryonic development possibly through reduced expression of the glucose transporter in order to study the effects of cryopreservation on later embryonic two-cell mouse embryos were and then allowed to develop into the percentage of cryopreserved embryos which developed into blastocysts was significantly lower than that of fresh two-cell the amount of glucose incorporation in terms of 3h-2-deoxyglucose uptake in blastocysts developed in and in vitro from fresh or frozen-thawed two-cell was 473 +/- 105 +/- and +/- fmol per embryo per quantification of glucose transporter glut1 in these embryos by western blotting was reflective of the degree of glucose the implantation rate of blastocysts developed in vitro from frozen-thawed two-cell embryos was significantly lower than that developed in vivo these data suggest that cryopreservation may have later consequences on embryonic development through a mechanism that involves altered glut1
delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol stimulates glucose utilization in c6 glioma the present work was undertaken to study the metabolic response of c6 glioma cells to physiologically relevant doses of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol the major active component of at those concentrations nanomolar thc produced a dose-dependent increase in the rates of glucose oxidation to co2 and glucose incorporation into phospholipids and the thc-induced stimulation of glucose utilization was (i) dose-dependent up to 100 nm (ii) mimicked by the synthetic cannabinoid and (iii) prevented by pertussis toxin and the cb1 receptor antagonist in contrast to forskolin markedly depressed co2 phospholipid synthesis and glycogen synthesis from the forskolin-induced inhibition of glucose utilization was (i) mimicked by and (ii) prevented by hu-210 and an inhibitor of the camp-dependent protein thc was able to antagonize in part the forskolin-induced elevation of intracellular camp and this antagonistic effect was prevented by thc per se did not affect basal camp results thus indicate that physiologically relevant doses of thc stimulate glucose metabolism in c6 glioma cells through a cannabinoid receptor-mediated although cannabinoid receptors may be coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in c6 glioma this does not seem to be the mechanism involved in the thc-induced stimulation of glucose

transforming growth factor beta is sequestered into an inactive pool by elevated plasma concentrations of low density lipoprotein (ldl) and very-low density lipoprotein (vldl) have been correlated with the development of these lipoproteins may promote atherogenesis by direct deposition of lipid in the vessel in previous data suggested that there was an inverse correlation between serum ldl-cholesterol concentration and the proportion of transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta) in an active form (grainger et nature here we have investigated whether lipoproteins can affect the activity of tgf-beta1 in plasma and show that tgf-beta can associate with the lipoprotein in the plasma of healthy 16 +/- 5% (mean +/- standard n = 57) of the total plasma tgf-beta1 was associated with the lipoprotein with the major proportion (64 +/- 15%) in the hdl-3 in ten diabetic subjects with moderately poor glucose control (hb alc > the proportion of total plasma tgf-beta in the lipoprotein fraction was 68 +/- this large increase in tgf-beta1 associated with the lipoprotein fraction was mainly due to association with and the lipoprotein fraction inhibits tgf-beta1 binding to the type ii tgf-beta receptor extracellular domain in an elisa and inhibits tgf-beta1 activity in the mink lung cell we propose that sequestration of tgf-beta into lipoproteins represents a novel mechanism by which tgf-beta activity in circulation may be lipoprotein sequestration of tgf-beta may therefore contribute to the severe depression of tgf-beta activity in advanced
assessment of hepatic sensitivity to glucagon in use as a tool to estimate the contribution of the indirect pathway to nocturnal glycogen niddm is associated with excessive rates of endogenous glucose production in both the postabsorptive and postprandial to determine whether this is due to an intrinsic increase in hepatic sensitivity to 9 niddm and 10 nondiabetic subjects were studied on three on each glycogen was labeled the evening before the study with subjects ingesting meals containing beginning at on the following somatostatin was infused to inhibit endogenous hormone insulin concentrations were maintained constant at basal levels (defined as that necessary to keep glucose at approximately 5 mmol/l) in each on one glucagon was infused at a rate of ng x kg(-1) x min(-1) throughout the resulting in glucagon concentrations of approximately 130 pg/ml and a slow but comparable fall in endogenous glucose production with time in both on the other two the glucagon infusion was increased at to either or ng x kg(-1) x resulting in an increase in glucagon concentrations to approximately 180 and 310 the increment in endogenous glucose production area above basal) did not differ in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects during either the ng x kg(-1) x min(-1) +/- +/- mmol/kg) or ng x kg(-1) x min(-1) +/- +/- mmol/kg) glucagon in the amount of [6-3h]glucose released from glycogen was lower (p < in the diabetic than nondiabetic subjects during both glucagon the specific activity of calculated as the integrated release of [6-3h]glucose divided by the integrated release of unlabeled was lower (p < in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects during both the ng x kg(-1) x min(-1) +/- +/- dpm/micromol) and ng x kg(-1) x min(-1) +/- +/- dpm/micromol) glucagon implying that a greater portion of the glucose released from glycogen was derived from the indirect we concluded that although niddm is not associated with an intrinsic alteration in hepatic sensitivity to it does alter the relative contributions of the direct and indirect pathways to nocturnal glycogen
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (gtp) gene transcription and hyperglycemia are regulated by glucocorticoids in genetically obese db/db transgenic the molecular mechanisms underlying increased hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pepck) gene transcription and gluconeogenesis in type ii diabetes are largely to examine the involvement of glucocorticoids and the cis-acting insulin response sequence -416/-407) in the genetically obese db/db mouse we generated crosses between c57bl/ksj-db/+ mice and transgenic mice that express -460 or -2000 base pairs of the rat pepck gene promoter containing an intact or mutated linked to a reporter transgenic mice expressing the intact pepck(460)-crp (c-reactive protein) transgene bred to near homozygosity at the db locus were and developed fasting hyperglycemia (389 +/- 26 mg/100 ml) between 4 and 10 weeks of levels of crp reporter gene expression were increased 2-fold despite severe hyperinsulinemia compared with non-diabetic non-obese transgenic reporter gene expression was also increased 2-fold in transgenic obese diabetic db/db mice bearing a mutation in the compared with non-obese non-diabetic transgenic 2000(irs)-hgx treatment of obese diabetic db/db transgenic mice with the glucocorticoid receptor blocker ru 486 decreased plasma glucose by 50% and reduced tyrosine and hgx reporter gene expression to levels similar to those of non-obese normoglycemic transgenic taken these results establish that -460 bp of sequence is sufficient to mediate the induction of pepck gene transcription in genetically obese db/db mice during the development of the results further demonstrate that the mechanism underlying increased expression of gluconeogenic enzymes in the db/db mouse requires the action of glucocorticoids and occurs independently of factors acting through the pepck irs (-416/-407) promoter binding
cardiolipin is not essential for the growth of saccharomyces cerevisiae on fermentable or non-fermentable carbon cardiolipin is a unique dimeric which is present throughout the eukaryotic kingdom and is specifically localized in mitochondrial it is widely believed that mitochondria possess an essential requirement for this to determine whether cardiolipin is essential for yeast we generated a cardiolipin synthase null mutant by disrupting the cls1 gene (open reading frame ydl142c on chromosome iv) of saccharomyces biochemical analysis of the mutant indicated that it had no cardiolipin synthase activity and no cardiolipin in its the enzyme phosphatidylglycerolphosphate which catalyses the committed step of the cardiolipin remained unaffected in the null haploid cells containing the null allele are viable in media containing galactose or glycerol/ethanol as the sole carbon although growth in galactose or glycerol/ethanol is somewhat reduced in the mutant compared with the wild these results indicate that cardiolipin is not essential for the growth of cerevisiae in fermentable or non-fermentable carbon
mechanism of bacteriophage sfii-mediated serotype conversion in shigella we have isolated the lysogenic bacteriophage which mediates glucosylation of shigella flexneri resulting in expression of the type ii sfii belongs to group a of the bradley classification and has a genome size of dna sequencing of a 4 kb bamhi subclone identified four open reading frames of which only two were found to be necessary for serotype these genes were named which encodes a putative bactoprenol glucosyl and encoding the putative type ii antigen determining glucosyl these genes are adjacent to the integrase gene (int) and attachment site which are highly homologous to those of salmonella bacteriophage another orf encoded a highly hydrophobic protein of 120 amino acids with homologues in escherichia salmonella bacteriophage p22 and previous studies identified the glucosyl transferase of bacteriophage which also glucosylates the o-antigen we determined that gtrx-mediated expression of the group antigen also requires this allowed us to identify gtrii as being the serotype antigen ii determining glucosyl southern hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analyses indicated that bgt homologues exist in the genomes of all flexneri serotypes and in coli whereas gtrii was only detected in strains of serotype transposon tnphoa-derived chromosomal mutations of bgt and gtrii in flexneri serotype 2a were isolated and [35s]-methionine labelling and the use of a t7 rna polymerase expression system identified a protein of 34kda corresponding to which has a predicted molecular weight of 55 was not we propose that the function of bgt is to transfer the glucose residues from the udp-glucose onto bactoprenol and gtrii then transfers the glucose onto the o-antigen repeat unit at the rhamnose iii the chromosomal organization of these serotype-converting when compared with their homologues in coli k-12 chromosome and the p22 bacteriophage were very this suggests that the regions encode similar functions in these organisms and have a similar evolutionary

control of pulsatile 5-ht/insulin secretion from single mouse pancreatic islets by intracellular calcium glucose-induced insulin release from single islets of langerhans is we have investigated the correlation between changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([ca2+]i) and oscillatory insulin secretion from single mouse in particular examining the basis for differences in secretory responses to intermediate and high glucose insulin release was monitored in real time through the amperometric detection of the surrogate insulin marker 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) via carbon fibre the [ca2+]i was simultaneously recorded by whole-islet fura-2 in 82 % of the exposure to 11 mm glucose evoked regular high-frequency min-1) synchronous oscillations in amperometric current and in the remaining experiments (18 11 mm glucose induced an oscillatory pattern consisting of high-frequency [ca2+]i oscillations that were superimposed on low-frequency min-1) [ca2+]i intermittent high-frequency [ca2+]i oscillations gave rise to a similar pattern of pulsatile 5-ht raising the glucose concentration from 11 to 20 mm increased the duration of the steady-state [ca2+]i oscillations without increasing their in both the duration and amplitude of the associated 5-ht transients were increased by glucose the amount of 5-ht released per secretion cycle was linearly related to the duration of the underlying [ca2+]i oscillations in both 11 and 20 mm the slopes of the straight lines were indicating that there is no significant difference between the ability of calcium oscillations to elicit 5-ht/insulin release in 11 and 20 mm in situ 5-ht microamperometry has the potential to resolve the high-frequency oscillatory component of the second phase of glucose-induced insulin this component appears to reflect primarily the duration of the underlying [ca2+]i suggesting that glucose metabolism and/or access to glucose metabolites is not rate limiting to fast pulsatile insulin
regional glucose metabolic abnormalities are not the result of atrophy in to determine whether the hypometabolism observed in pet images of patients with disease (ad) is due entirely to brain reduced brain glucose metabolism in ad patients measured using pet has been reported by numerous actual glucose metabolic values in ad may be reduced artificially because of brain which accentuates the partial volume effect (pve) on data collected by using segmented mr we corrected regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose for pves to evaluate the effect of atrophy on uncorrected values for brain metabolism in ad patients and healthy control global glucose metabolism was reduced significantly before and after correction in ad patients compared with before pve glucose metabolic values in patients were lower than in control subjects in the inferior and lateral temporal in the posterior and in the these reductions remained significantly lower after pve although in the posterior cingulate the difference in metabolism between ad patients and control subjects regional glucose metabolism of these areas with pve correction was lower in moderately-severely demented patients than in mildly demented reduced glucose metabolism measured by pet in ad is not simply an artifact due to an increase in csf space induced by but reflects a true metabolic reduction per gram of
chronic central leptin infusion enhances insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism and favors the expression of uncoupling continuous (4 days) intracerebroventricular leptin infusion (12 microg/day) was performed in lean and its hormonometabolic effects were intracerebroventricular leptin administration did not result in leakage of the hormone into the peripheral its effects were elicited by its presence within the central nervous intracerebroventricular leptin infusion produced marked decreases in food intake and body weight gain relative to vehicle-infused fed ad libitum because decreases in food intake alter hormonometabolic additional control rats pair-fed to the amount of food consumed by leptin-infused ones were included in the intracerebroventricular leptin-infused and vehicle-infused pair-fed rats were relative to vehicle-infused ad libitum-fed by decreases in body weight and insulinemia and by increases in insulin-stimulated overall glucose utilization and muscle and brown adipose tissue glucose utilization brown adipose tissue uncoupling protein and ucp3 mrna levels were markedly decreased in pair-fed animals relative to those of fed ad libitum control as were liver and white adipose tissue ucp2 and muscle ucp3 mrna in marked intracerebroventricular leptin administration was accompanied by the maintenance of high and ucp3 expression in all these despite analogies between effects and those of pair-feeding with regard to glucose their respective underlying mechanisms while leptin maintains or favors energy-dissipating mechanisms and the latter are markedly depressed in pair-fed this effect of leptin may prevent subsequent excessive storage thereby maintaining normal body
pancreatic beta-cell regeneration after 48-h glucose infusion in mildly diabetic rats is not correlated with functional we investigated the effect of glucose infusion on beta-cell regeneration in rats made mildly diabetic by a single injection of low dosage (35 mg/kg) streptozotocin nondiabetic (nd) and stz rats were submitted to a 48-h glucose infusion (hyperglycemia approximately 22 mmol/l in both nd and stz hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic [nd hg-hi and stz hg-hi before beta-cell mass was 65% lower in stz rats than in nd rats +/- +/- increased in nd hg-hi rats +/- and increased in stz hg-hi rats +/- in nd hg-hi beta-cell enlargement was related to an increase in beta-cell responsiveness to nutrient secretagogues both in vivo and in whereas in stz hg-hi no significant improvement in insulin secretion could be to determine the respective role of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia on beta-cell area nd and stz rats were submitted to a 48-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic no modification of beta-cell mass was detected in either in 48-h superimposed hyperglycemia was enough to restore beta-cell mass previously reduced by stz this effect seemed to be due to hyperglycemia rather than hyperinsulinemia the data stress the dissociation between beta-cell regeneration and improvement in islet function in diabetic our model seems suitable for studying factors that can improve the plasticity and function of the pancreas in
modulation of glucose transport in fetal rat a sexual male fetuses exhibit delayed lung maturation and surfactant production in comparison with female this delay may be related to sex hormone estrogen enhances and androgens delay lung the uptake of an important precursor for surfactant may be differently affected by estrogen and in these studies we determined the effects of these two hormones on glucose transport (glucose glucose transporter [glut] 1 and mrna) and hexokinase activity in lung tissue of fetal on day 20 of gestation (term = d) lung tissue was harvested from female and male fetal minced into and cultured for 24 basal glucose measured in the absence of sex was 37% higher (p < in female compared with male explants were washed and cultured for an additional 3 h or 24 h in either estradiol or dihydrotestosterone (dht) at or 100 twenty-four-hour treatment with estradiol in both male and female explants increase 2-deoxyglucose glut 1 and mrna levels (p < explants from male fetuses were not as responsive to estradiol treatment as were those from females (p < treatment for 24 h with dht decreased 2-deoxyglucose glut 1 and mrna levels in females and males (p < there was no difference in response between females and short-term incubation (3 h) with sex hormones had no effect on glucose 3-h treatment with estradiol did increase glut 1 mrna levels (p < hexokinase activity was not affected by estradiol or dht these findings indicate that estradiol and dht differentially regulate glucose uptake in fetal rat lung this regulation of substrate supply (glucose) by estradiol and dht may be another mechanism for the sexual dimorphism observed in lung development and surfactant
insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i)-stimulated pancreatic beta-cell growth is synergistic activation of insulin receptor substrate-mediated signal transduction pathways by glucose and igf-i in ins-1 nutrients and certain growth factors stimulate pancreatic beta-cell the appropriate mitogenic signal transduction pathways have not been in the glucose-sensitive pancreatic beta-cell it was found that glucose (6-18 mm) independently increased ins-1 cell proliferation (>20-fold at 15 mm insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i)-induced ins-1 cell proliferation was glucose-dependent only in the physiologically relevant concentration range (6-18 mm the combination of igf-i and glucose was increasing ins-1 cell proliferation >50-fold at 15 mm glucose + 10 nm glucose metabolism and phosphatidylinositol (pi activation were necessary for both glucose and igf-i-stimulated ins-1 cell igf-i and 15 mm glucose increased tyrosine phosphorylation mediated recruitment of grb2/msos and pi to irs-2 and glucose and igf-i also induced shc association with glucose (3-18 mm) and independently of activated mitogen-activated protein kinase but this did not correlate with igf-i-induced beta-cell in p70(s6k) was activated with increasing glucose concentration (between 6 and 18 and potentiated by igf-i in the same glucose concentration range which correlated with ins-1 cell proliferation glucose and igf-i-induced beta-cell proliferation were mediated via a signaling mechanism that was facilitated by mitogen-activated protein kinase but dependent on irs-mediated induction of pi activity and downstream activation of the glucose dependence of igf-i mediated ins-1 cell proliferation emphasizes beta-cell signaling mechanisms are rather unique in being tightly linked to glycolytic metabolic
effect of posture on intraperitoneal pressure and peritoneal permeability in the posture of the patient influences both the intraperitoneal pressure (ipp) and the peritoneal we have studied the effects of the supine and the upright position in six two peritoneal equilibration tests (pet) of 90-min dwell time each were performed firstly in the supine position and then in the upright the same amount of dialysate was instilled isotonic dextrose) for each using the same filling the ipp was significantly higher in the upright position +/- cm h2o) than in the supine position (8 +/- cm the mean percentage ipp increase was 130% +/- the decline in glucose resorption rate from the dialysate during the pet was significantly lower in the upright despite this greater relative loss of osmotic gradient in the upright than the supine no significant difference in net ultrafiltration was noted after 90 min of the peritoneal equilibration ratio during the pet was lower in the upright than the supine position for and these results favor performing peritoneal dialysis in a supine both to increase dialysis efficiency and to reduce patient
solute washout experiments for characterizing mass transport in hollow fiber immunoisolation the transport characteristics of immunoisolation membranes can have a critical effect on the design of hybrid artificial organs and cell it has been difficult to quantitatively evaluate the desired transport properties of different hollow fiber membranes due to bulk mass transfer limitations in the fiber lumen and annular an attractive alternative to existing methodologies is to use the rate of solute removal or from the annular space during constant flow perfusion through the fiber experimental washout curves were obtained for glucose and a 10 kd dextran in two different hollow fiber data were analyzed using a theoretical model which accounts for convective and diffusive transport in the and annular the model was in good agreement with the experimental results and provided an accurate measure of the effective membrane diffusion coefficient for both small and large this approach should prove useful in theoretical analyses of solute transport and performance of hollow fiber artificial

differential insulin secretory responses to cationic and branched-chain amino the long-term effects on the dynamics of glucose-stimulated insulin release by the cationic amino acids arginine and lysine and the branched-chain amino acid leucine were the rat pancreas perfusion model was utilized and particular emphasis was placed on modulation of the glucose-stimulated synthesis-secretion coupling second in the presence of mm 20 mm and leucine each potentiated first-phase insulin release by approximately compared to glucose-only in the presence of mm 20 mm arginine resulted in a 50% inhibition of second-phase (min 30-120) insulin release compared to glucose-only 20 mm lysine in the presence of mm glucose also caused a comparable inhibition of second-phase insulin 20 mm leucine in the presence of glucose had no significant inhibitory effect on second-phase glucose-stimulated insulin the data suggest that these amino acids mediate their effects on first- and second-phase insulin release via different mechanisms of which may reflect differences and similarities in charge and/or metabolic fates within the beta the data do not support the hypothesis that cationic charge is solely involved in the stimulus-secretion since all three amino acids caused comparable potentiation of first-phase insulin the inhibitory component of the second secretory phase may be mediated via a common charge-related metabolic pathway in the synthesis-secretion coupling since only the cationic amino acids inhibit this whereas leucine has no such

neonatal de-afferentation of capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves increases in vivo insulin sensitivity in conscious adult rats [see sensory released from the peripheral nervous might modulate glucose homeostasis by antagonizing insulin the effects of de-afferentation of functional small diameter unmyelinated c-fibres (sensory nerves) on in vivo insulin-mediated intracellular glucose metabolism were investigated by using euglycaemic insulin (6 and 18 mu/kg x min) clamps with [3-(3)h]-glucose infusion in 24 adult treated neonatally with either capsaicin (cap) (50 mg/kg) or vehicle following the skeletal muscle liver and adipose tissue were at plasma insulin levels of approximately 90 cap-rats showed a 21% increase in whole body glucose uptake compared with con +/- vs +/- mg/kg p < which was paralleled by a 20% increase in whole body glycolysis +/- vs +/- mg/ p < (concentration of 3h2o in whole body skeletal muscle glycogenesis was increased by 80% in cap-rats +/- vs +/- mg/kg x p < with increased muscle glycogen synthase whole body liver and adipose tissue combined) de novo lipogenesis also was increased in cap-rats compared with con +/- vs +/- mg/kg x p < (incorporation of [3-(3)h]-glucose counts into glycogen or hepatic glucose production was lower in cap-rats compared with con +/- vs +/- mg/kg x p < plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were reduced in 43 +/- 2 compared with 70 +/- 6 855 +/- 55 compared with 1131 +/- 138 513 +/- 136 compared with 1048 +/- 164 pmol/l and 928 +/- 142 compared with 1472 +/- 331 p < at plasma insulin levels of approximately 400 cap-rats showed no differences in peripheral and hepatic insulin action compared with we conclude that the removal of endogenous sensory by de-afferentation of capsaicin-sensitive sensory increases in vivo insulin but not 1) primarily through an increased sensitivity of skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis to 2) through a reduction in the levels of counter-regulatory thereby creating a milieu which favours overall in vivo insulin sensitivity with respect to glucose glucose glycogenesis and
effect of growth rate on resistance of candida albicans biofilms to antifungal a perfused biofilm which allows growth-rate control of adherent microbial was used to assess whether the susceptibility of candida albicans biofilms to antifungal agents is dependent on growth biofilms were generated under conditions of glucose limitation and were perfused with drugs at a high concentration (20 times the amphotericin b produced a greater reduction in the number of daughter cells in biofilm eluates than or similar decreases in daughter cell counts were observed when biofilms growing at three different rates were perfused with amphotericin in a separate series of intact resuspended biofilm and newly formed daughter cells were removed from the fermentor and were exposed to a lower concentration of amphotericin b for 1 the susceptibility profiles over a range of growth rates were then compared with those obtained for planktonic cells grown at the same rates under glucose limitation in a intact biofilms were resistant to amphotericin b at all growth rates whereas planktonic cells were resistant only at low growth rates cells resuspended from biofilms were less resistant than intact biofilm populations but more resistant than daughter the susceptibilities of both these cell types were largely independent of growth our findings indicate that the amphotericin b resistance of albicans biofilms is not simply due to a low growth rate but depends on some other feature of the biofilm mode of
effects of ffa on insulin-stimulated glucose fluxes and muscle glycogen synthase activity in to examine effects of free fatty acids (ffa) on insulin-stimulated glucose euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (86 pmol kg-1 min-1) clamps were performed for 5 h in conscious rats with (n = 8) or without (n = 8) lipid-heparin glucose infusion rate required to maintain euglycemia was not different between the two groups during the first 2 h of clamps but became significantly lower with lipid-heparin infusion in the 3rd h and to investigate changes in intracellular glucose metabolism during lipid-heparin additional clamps (n = 8 each) were performed for or 5 h with an infusion of insulin-stimulated whole body glucose utilization and glycogen synthesis were estimated on the basis of tracer concentrations in plasma during the final 40 min of each similar to changes in glucose infusion rd was not different between the two groups in the 1st and 2nd h but was significantly lower with lipid-heparin infusion in the 3rd h and whole body glycolysis was significantly lower with lipid-heparin infusion in all time and 5th h of in whole body glycogen synthesis was higher with lipid-heparin infusion in the 1st and 2nd h but lower in the 5th accumulation of [3h]glycogen radioactivity in muscle glycogen was significantly higher with lipid-heparin during the 1st and 2nd h but lower during the 3rd and 5th glucose 6-phosphate (g-6-p) concentrations in gastrocnemius muscles were significantly higher with lipid-heparin infusion throughout the muscle glycogen synthase (gs) activity was not altered with lipid-heparin infusion at and 3 h but was significantly lower at 5 thus increased availability of ffa significantly reduced whole body but compensatory increase in skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis in association with accumulation of g-6-p masked this and rd was not affected in the early phase (within 2 h) of lipid-heparin rd was reduced in the later phase (>2 h) of lipid-heparin when glycogen synthesis was reduced in association with reduced skeletal muscle gs

is growth hormone hypersecretion in diabetic adolescent girls also a daytime glycaemic control often deteriorates during puberty in girls with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus this may be due in part to the normal psychosocial changes associated with puberty also characterized by rapid somatic orchestrated by hormonal some of these hormones play a major role in glucose we have examined the insulin-gh-igf-i axis in 11 adolescent girls with poorly controlled insulin dependent diabetes and compared the data with those of 10 non-diabetic girls matched for pubertal stage and body mass index serum profiles of gh and igf binding protein 1 (igfbp1) were analysed in addition to igf-i in serum and nocturnal urinary excretion of serum insulin and igfbp1 were measured every hour for 24 whereas gh in serum was measured every 30 minutes during the same nocturnal urinary gh was analysed as a mean of three consecutive the insulin profiles of the iddm patients were flat with low post-prandial corresponding to only one-third of the peaks of the non-diabetic the integrated insulin both during 24-h sampling and during were significantly lower in the diabetic there were no differences during the diabetic patients had elevated mean baseline levels of serum gh (iddm +/- controls +/- p < a higher 24-h mean serum gh level +/- mu/l +/- p < significantly more peaks and a urinary gh excretion twice as high as in the non-diabetic an interesting observation was the finding of marked differences in daytime gh concentrations between the both regarding overall integrated levels (gh auc 103 +/- and +/- mu/l x 12 p < as well as baseline levels +/- mu/l +/- p < in during night-time only the mean basal levels of gh the level of igf-i was reduced in the diabetic group compared with the healthy controls (iddm 233 +/- 19 micrograms/l controls 327 +/- p < in the iddm patients had significantly increased concentrations of igfbp but kept a normal diurnal rhythm with a pronounced night hypoinsulinaemia in adolescent iddm particularly in the portal hepatic results in decreased igf-i and increased igfbp 1 production in the high levels of igfbp 1 in reduce the bioactivity of igf-i even low levels of igf-i will lead to increased gh earlier studies on the relationship between gh and diabetic control have focused on elevated gh levels during the in this study we have observed markedly elevated levels of gh also during daytime in adolescent iddm this indicates increased insulin resistance and insulin demand also during the day in diabetic the increased insulin resistance may result in hyperglycaemia leading to additional insulin a vicious circle may thus be accelerating metabolic impairment in poorly controlled adolescent iddm
glucose and glucoincretin peptides synergize to induce and nur-77 gene expression in pancreatic beta(ins-1) to link glucose signaling to its long-term pleiotropic effects in the pancreatic we have investigated whether glucose regulates immediate-early response genes (iegs) coding for transcription factors implicated in cell proliferation and glucose causes a coordinated transcriptional activation of the iegs and nur-77 in the pancreatic beta-cell line this activation is entirely dependent on the presence of the cell-permeant camp analog which has only a modest effect by the accumulation of and nur-77 mrna occurs at physiological concentrations of glucose (3 to 11 requires a 1-2 h and is mimicked by other nutrient stimuli including leucine plus and glucose is synergistic with the glucoincretin peptides glp-1 and whereas these neurohormonal agents have no effect at low (3 mm) the synergy between glucose and the glucoincretins is not based on camp alone as glucose does not further increase intracellular camp in response to glp-1 and a role for ca2+ signaling is since the l-type ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine markedly reduces the induction of c-fos and nur-77 by glucose and the induction of iegs by glucose and chlorophenylthio-camp or glp-1 and the inhibitory effect of nifedipine are also observed in the betahc9 cell the results indicate that glp-1 and pacap-38 act as competence factors for the action of glucose on and it is suggested that the synergistic effect of glucose and glucoincretins on ieg expression plays an important role in the adaptive processes of the beta-cell to
the cerebral metabolic effects of manipulating glutamatergic systems within the basal forebrain in conscious n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) and non-nmda receptor-mediated manipulations of the cortical cholinergic input arising from the basal forebrain differentially affect cognitive we used [14c]-2-deoxyglucose autoradiography in conscious rats to map the effects of excitatory amino acid agonist infusions into the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nbm) on cerebral functional as reflected by local rates of glucose acute stimulation of nbm neurones by local infusion of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid 15 min before glucose use resulted in glucose use reductions in nine cortical regions innervated by nbm efferents including sensorimotor and cingulate nmda infusions altered glucose use in two cortical both ampa and nmda markedly increased glucose use in the striatum and globus with concomitant perturbations in striato-pallidal projection targets including the substantia entopeduncular subthalamic nucleus and lateral habenular in the gabaa agonist muscimol did not affect glucose use in the nbm or neocortical but induced glucose use increases in several subcortical nuclei including the substantia nigra and entopeduncular the delayed effects of excitotoxic lesions were assessed 3 weeks after basal forebrain infusions of ibotenate or statistically significant glucose use changes only occurred in the hypothalamus after and the nbm after ibotenate although reduced cortical metabolism was apparent following ampa-induced lesions of the results support a dissociation between the functional sequelae of nmda and non-nmda receptor-mediated events in the basal and long-term compensatory functional adaptation following cortical
enhancement of doxorubicin content by the antitumor drug lonidamine in resistant ehrlich ascites tumor cells through modulation of energy the effect of the antitumor drug lonidamine (lnd) on aerobic adenylate doxorubicin (dox) and efflux in dox-resistant and dox-sensitive ehrlich tumor cells was the results may be summarized as 1) in both types of lnd inhibited both respiration and glycolysis in a dose-dependent manner and lowered the atp the effect was more marked in cells incubated in glucose-free 2) lnd to a remarkable the intracellular content of dox in resistant and sensitive cells respiring on endogenous substrates because of reduced atp whereas in glucose-supplemented where both respiration and glycolysis contributed to atp the increase was and 3) when lnd was added to dox-loaded it failed to significantly inhibit dox efflux because of time-dependent these findings indicated that a drug currently employed in tumor might also be useful in reducing or overcoming multidrug resistance (mdr) of those cells with a reduced ability to accumulate and retain antitumor
