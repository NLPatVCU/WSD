computerized simulation of color appearance for we propose an algorithm that transforms a digitized color image so as to simulate for normal observers the appearance of the image for people who have dichromatic forms of color the color confusions are deduced from and the residual hues in the transformed image are derived from the reports of unilateral dichromats described in the we represent color stimuli as vectors in a three-dimensional lms and the simulation algorithm is expressed in terms of transformations of this the algorithm replaces each stimulus by its projection onto a reduced stimulus this surface is defined by a neutral axis and by the lms locations of those monochromatic stimuli that are perceived as the same hue by normal trichromats and a given type of these monochromatic stimuli were a yellow of 575 nm and a blue of 475 nm for the protan and deutan and a red of 660 nm and a blue-green of 485 nm for the tritan the operation of the algorithm is demonstrated with a mosaic of square color a protanope and a deuteranope accepted the match between the original and the appropriate confirming that the reduction is colorimetrically although we can never be certain of the simulation provides a means of quantifying and illustrating the residual color information available to dichromats in any digitized
mosaic arrangement of ganglion cell receptive fields in rabbit the arrangement of ganglion cell receptive fields on the retinal surface should constrain several properties of including spatial anatomic and physiological studies on the mammalian retina have shown that the receptive fields of several types of ganglion cells tile the retinal with the degree of receptive field overlap apparently being similar for the different it has been difficult to test the generality of this because it is hard to sample many receptive fields in the same preparation with conventional single-unit in our the response properties and receptive fields of up to 80 neighboring ganglion cells in the isolated rabbit retina were characterized simultaneously by recording with a multielectrode the cells were divided into 11 classes on the basis of their characteristic light responses and the temporal structures of their impulse the mosaic arrangement of receptive fields for cells of a given class was examined after the spatial profile of each receptive field was fitted with a generalized gaussian for eight cell classes the mosaic arrangement was the profiles of neighboring cells approached each other at the 1-sigma thus field centers were 2 sigma the layout of fields for the remaining three classes was not well characterized because the fields were poorly fitted by a single gaussian or because the cells responded selectively to the 2-sigma center-center spacing may be a general principle of functional organization that minimizes spatial aliasing and confers a uniform spatial sensitivity on the ganglion cell

drosophila tissue polarity requires the cell-autonomous activity of the fuzzy which encodes a novel transmembrane the tissue polarity gene fuzzy (fy) has two roles in the development of drosophila wing one is to specify the correct orientation of the hair by limiting the site of prehair initiation to the distal vertex of the wing the other is to control wing cell hair number by maintaining the integrity of the cytoskeletal components that direct hair the requirement for fy in these processes is temperature as the amorphic fy phenotype is cold analysis of mosaic wings has shown that the fy gene product functions cell we have cloned the fy which encodes a novel four-pass transmembrane protein that shares significant homology with proteins encoded by vertebrate the fourth putative transmembrane domain does not appear to play a significant role in tissue polarity as it is deleted in a weak fy expression of the fy transcript is developmentally regulated and peaks sharply at the time of wing cell pre-hair
do nf1 gene deletions result in a characteristic neurofibromatosis-1 (nf1) is an autosomal dominant disorder with marked variability of analysis of the nf1 gene (nf1) has detected a variety of mutations without any clear correlation with deletions which remove all of nf1 have been reported in a small number of patients who have minor facial mental learning and early or excessive burden of cutaneous or plexiform the purpose of this study was to determine whether these phenotypic traits are associated with whole gene out of 406 of our nf1 70 patients had manifestations previously associated with gene thirty-five of these patients from 26 families were available for by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) 4 were found to have deletions of the entire including 2 sporadic 1 familial and 1 case where family history could not be in the mother of the familial case was found to be mosaic for the our results suggest that although large nf1 deletions occur with relatively high frequency in patients with certain the presence of a deletion cannot be predicted solely on the basis of clinical
mosaic open reading frames in the arabidopsis thaliana mitochondrial in the mitochondrial genome of arabidopsis thaliana eight mosaic open reading frames arose by recombination of fragments duplicated from one or more mitochondrial these duplications represent unedited suggesting their derivation from genomic dna rather than five of the chimeric reading frames contain the information for the n-terminus of the original polypeptide and upstream these observations suggest that the generation of novel open reading frames in plant mitochondria can occur rather easily by chance extensions of duplicated gene the presence of so many mosaic open reading frames in the normal arabidopsis thaliana mitochondrial genome suggests that such recombined sequences interfere only occasionally and fortuitously with the peak mitochondrial performance presumably required during pollen and usually do not cause a cytoplasmic male sterile

potyvirus genome-linked protein (vpg) determines pea seed-borne mosaic virus pathotype-specific virulence in pisum the mechanism of pisum sativum pathotype-specific resistance to pea seed-borne mosaic potyvirus (psbmv) was investigated and the coding region determinant of psbmv virulence was homozygous recessive sbm-1 peas are unable to support replication of psbmv pathotype 1 whereas biochemically and serologically related pathotype 4 (p-4) is fully infectious in the sbm-1/sbm-1 we were unable to detect viral coat protein or rna with double antibody sandwich-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in sbm-1/sbm-1 p-1-inoculated protoplasts and lack of viral coat protein or rna in p-1 transfected sbm-1/sbm-1 protoplasts suggests that sbm-1 resistance is occurring at the cellular level and that inhibition of cell-to-cell virus movement is not the operating form of in because virus products were not detected at any time resistance must either be constitutive or expressed very early in the virus infection p-1-resistant peas challenged with infectious p-1/p-4 recombinant clones demonstrated that a specific p-4 coding the genome-linked protein was capable of overcoming sbm-1 whereas clones containing the p-1 vpg coding region were noninfectious to sbm-1/sbm-1 vpg is believed to be involved in potyvirus replication and its identification as the psbmv determinant of infectivity in sbm-1/sbm-1 peas is consistent with disruption of an early p-1 replication
a lack of neuroblastoma in down a study from 11 european an epidemiological investigation in 11 european countries comprising a total childhood population of million children and using 8 separate data sources was conducted to evaluate the occurrence of neuroblastoma in down syndrome no cases of ds were detected among 6724 infants and children with although more than five were this highly significant result (p = according to the poisson test) is consistent with data in the which contains only two poorly detailed cases in epidemiological studies and one ganglioneuroma in a ds mosaic like other such as testicular germ cell tumors and lymphomas are in excess in ds the lack of neuroblastomas does not reflect a general decreased incidence of cancer but rather a specific underrepresentation of this precise s-100 b the gene for which maps to the long arm of chromosome (a) is overproduced in ds (b) produces growth inhibition and differentiation of neural cells in (c) is abundant in good-prognosis and (d) has been shown to induce growth inhibition and differentiation and cell death in several human and murine neuroblastoma cell lines and could be responsible for this additional epidemiological and experimental studies are warranted to confirm our interpretation of these
a novel gene that regulates tissue polarity and cell fate decisions in polarity in the drosophila eye is manifested as a dorsoventral reflection of two chiral forms of the individual unit or these forms fall on opposite sides of a dorsoventral midline of mirror symmetry known as the polarity is established in the eye imaginal disc as cells adopt their fates and as the ommatidial precursors undergo coordinated rotation within the the mechanisms that coordinate these early patterning events remain poorly we have identified a novel strabismus which is required to establish polarity in the legs and bristles of many stbm ommatidia are reversed anteroposteriorly and/or in stbm eye ommatidial rotation is delayed and some ommatidial precursors initiate rotation in the wrong mosaic analysis indicates that stbm is ommatidium autonomous and required in if not photoreceptors within an ommatidium to establish normal stbm also appears to play an instructive role during the establishment of the fates of photoreceptors r3 and stbm encodes a novel protein with a potential pdz domain-binding motif and two possible transmembrane sequence analysis of both vertebrate and invertebrate homologs indicates that stbm has been highly conserved throughout

identifying loci required for follicular patterning using directed we have developed a system in drosophila by using the gal4 system to control the expression of the yeast in a spatial and temporal by directing flp we show that it is possible to efficiently and specifically target loss-of-function studies for vital loci to the developmental pathway of a simple f1 adult phenotypic screen demonstrated that most adult tissues can be analyzed with this using gal4 lines expressed during we have refined the system to examine the roles of vital loci in the development of the follicular we have identified essential genes involved in egg chamber cell migration and cell we have used this technique to gain insights into the role of the drosophila egf receptor pathway in establishing the egg using different gal4 and existing frt we have built stocks that permit the analysis of approximately 95% of the genome in follicular
somatic and dendritic mosaics formed by large ganglion cells in the retina of the common house gecko (hemidactylus recent studies of large ganglion cells in fishes and frogs have identified a shared inventory of three basic with characteristic forms and spatially independent mosaic these anamniote types and mosaics are hard to match to the large ganglion cell types and mosaics of implying that the underlying developmental programmes have diverged during reptiles and mammals both belong to the amniote so the point of divergence can be investigated by comparing the large ganglion cells of reptiles with those of taking fishes and frogs as with this ganglion cells of the common house hemidactylus were labelled with horse-radish peroxidase by an in vitro method and studied in retinal two spatially independent mosaics were consistently one (alpha a) was characterized by somata displaced into the inner nuclear layer and dendrites forming planar trees in sublamina the other (alpha ab) comprised large orthotopic somata and bistratified dendrites that formed discrete planar subtrees in sublaminae a and these subtrees were joined by up to 40 vertical link whose distribution was found to correlate with the underlying photoreceptor some specimens also contained patches of a third mosaic (alpha characterized by large orthotopic somata and very large flat trees in sublamina but the labelling of this type was these reptilian mosaics share several distinctive characters with anamniote alpha-cell mosaics but differ markedly from the ganglion cell mosaics of any known the most parsimonious conclusion is that those mosaic features that are shared by the ganglion cells of all nonmammals are homologous and primitive while those that are shared by all therian mammals are homologous and derived this is consistent with other differences between mammalian and nonmammalian mosaic formation seems to be a universal characteristic of large ganglion
mosaic genes and their role in penicillin-resistant streptococcus penicillin resistance in clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae is mediated by mosaic genes encoding altered penicillin binding mosaic sequence blocks are the result of a genetic exchange between related streptococcal it is likely that resistance has emerged in commensal streptococci before being transferred into the closely related mosaic genes are found in different pneumococcal clones and in different streptococcal species isolated worldwide since the first reports on such strains in the late demonstrating the importance of commensal streptococci for the spread of selectable markers in naturally transforming
resistant penicillin-binding low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins which participate in the beta-lactam resistance of several pathogenic have different natural transformation and recombination events with dna acquired from neighbouring intrinsically resistant organisms are responsible for the appearance of mosaic genes encoding two or three low-affinity pbps in highly resistant strains of transformable microorganisms such as neisseria and streptococcus methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains possess the meca determinant which probably evolved within the staphylococcus genus from a closely related and physiologically functional gene that was modified by point the expression of meca is either inducible or a stable high-level resistant phenotype requires the synthesis of a normally constituted enterococci have a natural low susceptibility to beta-lactams related to the presence of an intrinsic low-affinity highly resistant enterococcal strains overexpress this pbp and/or reduce its
dual functions of the drosophila eyes absent gene in the eye and in eyes absent (eya) eye progenitor cells undergo cell death early in whereas the phenotype of eya1 is limited to the other mutations are genetic and molecular analysis reveals that mutations in one region of the gene cause embryonic whereas mutations throughout the gene cause defects in eye mosaic analysis indicates that the eya requirement is cell in eye-specific expression in the eye disc is lacking while embryonic expression is both the type i and type ii transcripts are expressed in the developing and expression of either can rescue the eye these data indicate a specific requirement for eya function in eye progenitor cells that is normally fulfilled by both copyright 1998 elsevier science ireland all rights

two phases of hox gene regulation during early xenopus we have shown previously that fibroblast growth factor (fgf) signalling in posterior regions of the xenopus embryo is required for the development of the trunk and tail via a molecular pathway that includes the caudal-related gene xcad3 and the posterior hox genes these results have been contested by the work of kroll and amaya which shows that xenopus embryos transgenic for a dominant-negative form of the fgf receptor (fgf-ri) express posterior hox genes leading these authors to suggest that the fgfs are not required for anteroposterior (a-p) patterning of the dorsal in order to investigate the apparent discrepancy between these we have produced xenopus embryos transgenic for two inhibitors of the fgf/caudal a kinase-deficient dominant-negative fgf receptor (xfd) and a domain-swapped form of xcad3 (xcad-enr) in which the activation domain of xcad3 is replaced by the repression domain of the drosophila engrailed both of these were introduced as fusions with the green fluorescent protein which allows identification of non-mosaic transgenic embryos at early gastrula stages by simply looking for gfp analysis of gene expression in embryos transgenic for these constructs indicated that the activation of posterior hox genes during early neurula stages absolutely requires fgf signalling and transcriptional activation by while the maintenance of hox gene expression in the trunk and tail during later development is independent of both fgf and
fgf is an essential regulator of the fifth cell division in preimplantation mouse fibroblast growth factor (fgf) signaling is required prior to gastrulation in the mouse to test for the spatial and temporal requirements of fgf a dominant negative fgf receptor (dnfgfr) was used to make transgenic mouse in mosaic cell division ceased at the fifth cell division in all cells that expressed the mutant but cell death did not after the fifth cell the progeny of unaltered cells and cells expressing lacz continued to accumulate at the same suggesting that the fgf requirement is cell in mosaic but not dnfgfr expression was detected in mitotic trophoblasts adjacent to the dnfgfr-expressing extraembryonic ectoderm cells were detected at the abembryonic pole in postmitotic in blastocysts expressing the dnfgfr in all the morphology appeared normal and inner cell masses (icms) but resultant embryos had only one-third the number of cells as control in these cell division had also ceased at the fifth cell but a concurrent morphogenetic initiated and progressed to test for the continuing requirement of fgfr-3 was overexpressed in all cells and resulted in an increase in cell numbers after the fifth cell in a model for postimplantation addition of fgf-4 to blastocyst outgrowths increased the number of extraembryonic ectoderm suggesting a continuing role for fgf signaling induces the cell division of embryonic and extraembryonic cells in the preimplantation mouse embryo starting at the fifth cell the signal requirement for fgf is cell but is not required to prevent cell this provides the first evidence for the necessity of a growth factor before

the developmental basis for germline mosaicism in mouse and drosophila data involving germline mosaics in drosophila melanogaster and mouse are reconciled with developmental mutations that become fixed in the early embryo before separation of soma from the germline by the sampling process of continue as part of germline and/or differentiate into any somatic the cuticle of adult because of segmental can be used to estimate the proportion of mutant nuclei in the early but most somatic tissues and the germlines of both species continue from samples too small to be representative of the early because of the small sample of cells/nuclei that remain in the germline after separation of soma in both mosaic germlines have percentages of mutant cells that vary with a mean of 50% and an unusual flat-topped while the sampling process leads to similar statistical results for both their patterns of development are very in melanogaster the first differentiation is the separation of soma from germline with the germline continuing from a sample of only two to four whereas the adult cuticle is a representative sample of cleavage the presence of mosaicism in melanogaster germline is independent of mosaicism in the and this independence was used to determine that mutations can occur at any of the early embryonic cell divisions and still average 50% mutant germ cells when the germline is the later the mutation the higher the proportion of completely nonmutant in contrast to the first differentiation in the mouse does not separate soma from germline but produces the inner cell mass that is representative of the cleavage following formation of the primitive the primordial germ cells develop at the base of the allantois and among a clonally related sample of providing the same statistical distribution in the mouse germlines as in the proportion of mutations that are fixed during early embryonic development is greatly for a dna lesion in a postmeiotic gamete that becomes fixed as a dominant mutation during early embryonic development of the f1 may produce an individual completely mutant in the germ line and relevant somatic tissue the f1 germline may be completely mutant but with no relevant somatic tissues for detecting the mutation until the in both cases the mutation would be classified as complete in the f1 and and not recognized as embryonic in because germ cells differentiate later in mammalian there are more opportunities for correlation between germline and soma in the mammal than because the germ cells and any somatic like are derived from small there may be many individuals that test negative in blood but have germlines that are either mosaic or entirely

an age-associated correlation between cellular bioenergy decline and mtdna rearrangements in human skeletal post-mitotic tissues such as skeletal muscle develop a tissue bioenergy mosaic during the process of normal aging that eventually culminates into a bioenergetically diverse tissue containing cells ranging in their oxidative phosphorylation capacity from normal to grossly the mosaic is postulated to develop continuously from birth with the relative proportions of cytochrome c oxidase (cox) proficient (positive) and cox deficient (negative) muscle fibers differing dramatically as a function of young individuals only display the rare fiber deficient in cox activity while aged individuals show a significantly higher proportion of negative there appears to be a random element governing which cells will be adjacent cells within a given tissue may exhibit vastly differing cox multiple mitochondrial dna (mtdna) deletions also appear to accumulate in skeletal similarly displaying a dramatic disparity as a function of our previous findings have indicated that the accumulation of multiple mtdna along with a concurrent decrease in wild-type strongly correlates with the age-associated decrease in cox activity observed in skeletal although no definitive associations were established at the cellular an important prediction arose from this cells that accumulate large numbers of mitochondrial mutations and have reduced levels of full-length mtdna would be expected to be severely affected and show reduced cox activity as a cells that accumulate fewer mutations or retain adequate amounts of wild-type mtdna would be predicted to be less affected or even retain normal oxidative in order to establish a link associating cox activity to the status of mtdna within individual we developed single cell extra-long pcr the procedure was used to assess the relative concentration of full-length mtdna with respect to any mtdna deletions detected in individual human skeletal muscle fibers of cox single cell xl-pcr analysis of cox positive fibers dissected from a 5-year old and 90-year old individual showed that 80% or more of the fibers contained full length mtdna and if mtdna cox deficient or cox intermediate fibers taken from the same by depicted a heterogeneous population of rearranged mtdna species with no detectable full-length the data presented here indicates that cox deficient muscle fibers extracted from regardless of were accompanied by extensive mtdna rearrangements and reduced levels of full-length this provides compelling evidence linking mtdna mutations to cox activity decline in skeletal muscle and has important implications when considering the molecular basis of the aging copyright 1998 elsevier science
