impact of aging on rat urinary bladder little is known about the fatigability of the urinary in these we characterized contractile and bioenergetic changes in bladder fatigue and investigated the impact of aging on these materials and whole urinary bladders from 3-month-old (n = 17) and 24-month-old (n = 12) sd rats were isolated and individually mounted in organ the bladders were electrostimulated repeatedly (50 32 1 every the pressure rate of pressure generation and the emptying ability (% volume emptied) of the isolated bladders were measured with each after the 20th the bladders were immediately stimulated with 500 microm upon completion of their series of some of the bladders were quickly frozen in liquid tissue phosphocreatine and atp content of the frozen bladders and a group (six 3-month-old and six 24-month-old rats) of fresh bladder tissues was determined using high performance liquid chromatography the results can be summarized as (1) pressure rate of pressure generation and emptying ability were gradually reduced in both young and aged bladders as repeated stimulation (2) the final bethanechol stimulation emptied the same intravesical volume as the 20th electrostimulation emptied (in both indicating that bladder fatigue is due to a post-synaptic (3) as compared to their own first aged rats exhibited significantly greater rates of reduction in both pressure generation and emptying ability than did young (4) analysing fresh bladder the phosphocreatine and atp concentration of the aged bladders were significantly less than those of the young +/- and +/- protein respectively in the aged bladders +/- and +/- protein respectively in the young after repeated phosphocreatine and atp concentration were reduced in both groups +/- and +/- protein in the aged +/- and +/- protein in the young with a greater degree of reduction in the aged these observations indicate in response to repeated aged rat bladders became fatigued faster than young decreased capability in energy production might be one contributing factor for faster fatiguability of the aged urinary
the effect of ethanol and/or food restriction on coenzyme q in liver in the individual and combined effects of ethanol and lovastatin on rats and their prevention by supplemental coenzyme q10 (coq10) was the ethanol and lovastatin findings are reported this paper focuses on the food restriction which occurred in rats fed 35% of energy as ethanol and those control rats pair-fed to the 35% of energy as ethanol six groups of rats received 35% of energy as ethanol (with or without lovastatin and/or coq10 one group served as a 0% ethanol ad libitum control and one 0% ethanol control group was pair-fed to the 35% ethanol rats receiving 35% of energy as ethanol and their pair-fed controls consumed 83% of the energy/day consumed by the ad libitum this was consistent regardless of lovastatin or coq10 weight gains were 84% of the energy reduction was consistently associated with a substantial (48%+) increase in liver coq9 reports by others of associations between food restriction and increased longevity in rodents has focused on a decrease in oxidant damage in tissues of food restricted the increase in coq levels in the food restricted animals would result in an increase in antioxidant protection and might explain the observed increases in
responses of meat-type chickens to choice feeding of diets differing in protein and energy from hatch to market chickens from three genetic stocks known to differ in growth potential consumed ad libitum either a single (control) diet or a choice of two diets that differed in protein and formulation of the choice diets was such that when mixed in specific proportions they provided single diets that decreased in protein and increased in energy over the experimental when comparisons of feeding regimens were made at a common body weights and feed efficiencies for all stocks were enhanced in chicks fed a single when comparisons were made at a common body weight for chickens fed the single diet were about 15% heavier than those given a dietary for feed the pattern remained for the faster growing stock whereas there was no difference between feeding regimens for the slower growing chicks provided a choice of diets had heavier abdominal fat pads and lighter breasts relative to body weight than those fed a single with choice there were stock by diet interactions for dietary preferences through the first 9 d after early the interactions resulted from the faster growing stocks exhibiting a greater preference for the diet higher in protein and lower in energy than the slower growing by day the interaction occurred because stocks exhibited either no dietary preference or preferred the diet that was lower in protein and higher in regardless of genetic at 9 d of age and thereafter there was a clear preference for the diet lower in protein and higher in energy than the diet higher in protein and lower in these data for feed intake were consistent with behavioral observations that showed a preponderance of chicks eating from the feeder containing the diet lower in protein and higher in compared to a single under choice energy utilization was negatively influenced more in the faster than slower growing protein and sulfur amino acid utilization was not affected by feeding regimen in faster growing but was enhanced under choice feeding in the slower growing although lysine utilization was enhanced by choice feeding in all the effect was greater in the slower than in the faster growing these data demonstrate that although broiler diets are formulated to enhance growth and overall feed chicks that are provided a dietary choice of protein and energy do not eat to maximize growth or feed

intratumoral delivery of boronated epidermal growth factor for neutron capture therapy of brain the gene for epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) is amplified or overexpressed in high-grade gliomas but is low or undetectable in normal there has been increasing interest in using epidermal growth factor (egf)-based bioconjugates as targeting agents for brain in the present we have investigated the potential use of boronated egf as a delivery agent for boron neutron capture which is based on the capture reaction that occurs when a stable is irradiated with low-energy thermal a fourth generation starburst dendrimer was boronated and linked to egf using heterobifunctional either wild-type or egfr gene transduced c6 glioma cells which expressed 10(5)-10(6) receptor were stereotactically implanted into the right cerebral hemisphere of fischer four weeks the rats received either or intratumoral injection of 131i-labeled boronated starburst dendrimer (bsd) or the biodistribution of 131i-bsd-egf and 131i-bsd was studied by means of whole-body and gamma scintillation following injection of of the injected dose per gram tissue (% id/g) was localized in c6egfr tumors at 24 h and at 48 h compared to 5 and id/g in c6 wild-type and and for injected animals at the corresponding in following injection of only id/g was localized in the liver and spleen at 24 and 48 h compared to 5-12% id/g following our data indicate that direct injection can selectively deliver bsd-egf to egfr-positive gliomas and suggest that intracerebral administration may be the most effective way for delivering egf-based bioconjugates to egfr-positive brain
conformational analysis of six- and twelve-membered ring compounds by molecular a molecular dynamics (md)-based conformational analysis has been performed on a number of cycloalkanes in order to demonstrate the reliability and generality of md as a tool for conformational md simulations on cyclohexane and a series of methyl-substituted cyclohexanes were performed at temperatures between 400 and 1200 depending on the simulation different types of interconversions twist-boat-chair and chair-chair) could be and the md simulations demonstrated the expected correlation between simulation temperature and ring inversion a series of methyl-substituted were investigated at 1000 and the number of chair-chair interconversions could be quantitatively correlated to the experimentally determined ring inversion the distribution of sampled minimum-energy conformations correlated with the energy-derived boltzmann the macrocyclic ring system cyclododecane was subjected to an md simulation at 1000 k and 71 different conformations could be these conformations were compared with the results of previously reported conformational analyses using stochastic search and the md method provided 19 out of the 20 most stable conformations found in the mm2 force the general performance of the md method for conformational analysis is
chromosomal aberrations induced in human lymphocytes by high-let high linear energy transfer (let) particles are more efficient than sparsely ionizing radiations in inducing chromosomal in particular complex we analysed r-banded chromosome rearrangements in human lymphocytes irradiated with several ions having a wide range of let the frequency of chromosome breaks unrejoined or inferred from observed and of complex rearrangements induced by a single increased with the let up to about 100-150 kev/micron and seemed to level off for higher let additional study was focused on damage induced by oxygen ions of three different significant cell cycle and multiple chromosome rearrangements and breaks were demonstrated using giemsa and fluorescence-plus-giemsa coupled with chromosome damage increased with the fluence and the but at the higher let damage decreased for fluences > 10(7) cell death and g2 block might be involved in this chromosome 1 painting exhibited a high frequency of breaks and complex which would not have been detected using a standard complex rearrangements were induced by as few as one particle per cell nucleus and may be considered as a biological fingerprint of high-let
protein optimization of electrostatic contributions by partially neutralizing surface ionic charge-neutralization is developed to study influence of the relative amount of positive and negative charges in proteins on their structural a given number of either positively or negatively charged groups are neutralized in all of their possible combinations to generate a whole set of distinct the coulomb energy of each species is calculated by numerically solving the poisson-boltzmann equation for aqueous partial neutralization of lysine residues of tuna cytochrome c in aqueous solution at neutral ph with the debye-huckel screening parameter kappa = 1 nm-1 reproduces qualitatively well the destabilization of acetylated cytochrome c observed in physicochemical measurements at ph the stabilization of its molten globule state at ph 2 is also studied with the present it is shown that the electrostatic contribution to the structural stability of natural proteins can be optimized by changing the difference in number of their positive and negative

chronic weight cycling increases oxidative dna damage levels in mammary gland of female rats fed a high-fat oxidative dna damage levels may be a marker of breast cancer risk that is modulated by we examined the effects of a high-fat diet fed in varying feeding regimens on levels of an oxidized thymidine in dna from mammary gland of aging female a total of 48 rats were randomly divided into four ad libitum fed weight cycled above baseline weight cycled below baseline or energy restricted (er) for 28 wc groups were fed repeated ad libitum/restricted amounts of the at both wc groups had body weights similar to the er group but higher levels of 5-ohmu (p < 5-ohmu levels were higher in the wc groups than in the al even though body weights of the wc groups were significantly lower (p < these results indicate that a history of weight even when body weight is can have adverse effects on 5-ohmu levels in mammary gland a potential biomarker of cancer constant control of calories for the maintenance of body may be more
effect of measurement error on energy-adjustment models in nutritional the use and interpretation of energy-adjustment regression models in nutritional epidemiology has been vigorously debated there has been little regarding the effect of dietary measurement error on the performance of such contrary to conventional assumptions invoked in the standard treatment of the effect of measurement error in regression reporting errors in dietary studies are usually correlated with true nutrient intakes and with each and nonnormally methods developed in this paper allow for this more complex error structure and are therefore more appropriate for dietary for practical these methods are applied to data from the health trial vanguard the results demonstrate considerable shrinkage in the magnitude of the estimated main exposure effect in energy-adjustment models due to attenuation of the true effect and contamination from the effect of an adjusting in most this shrinkage causes a sharply reduced statistical power of the corresponding significance test in comparison with measurement without these results emphasize the need to understand the measurement error properties of dietary instruments through validation/calibration studies where to correct for the impact of measurement error when applying energy-adjustment
the role of phosphometabolites in cell energy and tumor a common characteristic of tumor cells is the constant overexpression of glycolytic and glutaminolytic in tumor cells the hyperactive hexokinase and the partly inactive pyruvate kinase lead to an expansion of all phosphometabolites from glucose 6-phosphate to in addition to the glycolytic synthesis of their metabolic derivatives such as and udp-n-acetyl glucosamine is also enhanced during cell another phosphometabolite derived from inhibits cell the accumulation of amp inhibits both p-ribose-pp-synthetase and the increase in concentration of phosphometabolites derived from in cells with low glycerol 3-phosphate and malate-aspartate shuttle capacities the inhibition of the lactate dehydrogenase by low nadh levels leads to an inhibition of glycolytic atp several tumor-therapeutic drugs reduce nad and nadh thereby inhibiting glycolytic energy the role of and nadph levels in the success of chemotherapeutic treatment is
microbial thiamin metabolism in the rumen simulating fermenter the effect of acidogenic a high sulfur level and added the effects of acidogenic a high s level and the addition of thiamin on the rumen microbial metabolism of thiamin were investigated in vitro in a semi-continuous fermenter using a factorial acidogenic conditions were obtained by simultaneously increasing the cellulose ratio and the amount of solid substrate and by decreasing the buffering capacity of the liquid phase of the s in the form of sulfate was supplied at two one corresponding to a control amount of s (2 g/kg dietary the second to an excess (5 g/kg dm) which is sufficient to trigger cerebrocortical necrosis (ccn) when used in acidogenic conditions decreased the ph of the ch4 production and cellulose increased the short-chain fatty acid but had no effect on thiamin the high s level enhanced the production of sulfide had no effect ont he microbial metabolism of energy and and decreased thiamin production (326 266 the added thiamin was rapidly converted into phosphorylated compounds which largely decreased the apparent synthesis of this vitamin by the rumen the total thiamin flow was increased by added in no case was thiaminase activity in the fermenter liquid phase significantly the high level of s induced only a limited decrease of total thiamin it is unlikely that the investigated factors could be considered to be high risk factors for the thiamin-dependent

dietary energy restriction does not inhibit pancreatic carcinogenesis by n-nitrosobis-2-(oxopropyl)amine in the syrian dietary energy restriction was previously shown to be effective in preventing a wide range of experimentally induced studies were conducted to assess the influence on pancreatic carcinogenesis of dietary energy restrictions (reduced fat and carbohydrate) of 20% or 40% in comparison with control in syrian hamsters treated with n-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine two carcinogenesis studies were one used a single treatment with 20 mg bop/kg body weight and followed hamsters for 102 weeks following and the other used three weekly treatments of 20 mg bop/kg body weight and followed hamsters for 45 weeks after hamsters were fed control or energy restricted diet beginning the week following the last bop pancreatic carcinomas were induced in 9-18% of the hamsters in the first experiment and in 59-66% of the animals in the dietary energy restriction did not influence carcinoma incidence in either and in the second experiment the multiplicity of tumors was higher in the 40% energy restriction (er) group than in control plasma corticosterone was suppressed by bop particularly in the 20% and 40% er hamsters in the second and diet or bop treatment did not significantly alter plasma pancreatic protein kinase czeta measured by western blot was highest in the cytosol and particulate fractions of the 40% er hamsters in the first these results indicate that dietary energy restriction is not effective in the prevention of bop induced pancreatic carcinogenesis in the syrian
leptin selectively decreases visceral adiposity and enhances insulin intraabdominal adiposity and insulin resistance are risk factors for diabetes and a fat-derived protein encoded by the ob has been postulated to be a sensor of energy storage in adipose tissue capable of mediating a feedback signal to sites involved in the regulation of energy we provide evidence for specific effects of leptin on fat distribution and in vivo insulin leptin (lep) or vehicle (con) was administered by osmotic minipumps for 8 d to pair-fed adult during the 8 d of the body weight and total fat mass decreased similarly in lep and in while moderate calorie restriction (con) resulted in similar decreases in whole body (by 20%) and visceral (by 21%) leptin administration led to a specific and marked decrease (by 62%) in visceral during physiologic hyperinsulinemia (insulin leptin markedly enhanced insulin action on both inhibition of hepatic glucose production and stimulation of glucose leptin exerted complex effects on the hepatic gene expression of key metabolic enzymes and on the intrahepatic partitioning of metabolic which are likely to represent a defense against excessive storage of energy in adipose these studies demonstrate novel actions of circulating leptin in the regulation of fat insulin and hepatic gene expression and suggest that it may play a role in the pathophysiology of abdominal obesity and insulin
a novel method of scatter correction using a single isotope for simultaneous emission and transmission photon attenuation and scatter are the most important factors degrading the quantitative accuracy of single photon emission tomography simultaneous spet and transmission tomographic (tt) scans with dual isotopes have been reported to correct attenuation and there is cross-contamination of different energies (scatter from emission data to transmission data and from transmission data to emission a method has been proposed to acquire emission (functional) and transmission (structural) data simultaneously with a single isotope a 99tcm transmission line source at the focal distance is attached to the rotating drum plate of a triple-headed gamma camera equipped with fan-beam the transmission source has the same energy spectrum as the emission source because 99tcm is also used for the triple-headed spet system allows the transmission and emission data to be acquired by one detector while the other two detectors d3) simultaneously acquire emission the transmission data can be calculated by subtracting d2 (d3) from d1 after correction for a transmission-dependent method for scatter correction was implemented with the transmission and emission in there is no energy cross-contamination using 99tcm as the transmission-emission the results of scatter correction demonstrate a clear improvement in spatial the contrasts were increased for different sized regions both in spet and brain the results indicate that the proposed method can overcome the difficulty associated with simultaneous dual-isotope they further support the feasibility of simultaneous spet and tt scanning using a single

characterization of the chloride conductance in porcine renal brush-border membrane the chloride conductance in brush-border membrane vesicles prepared from pig kidney cortex was investigated using a light-scattering anion-diffusion-potential-dependent na+-d-glucose cotransport and 36cl- k+-diffusion-potential-driven salt exit or entry the vesicles was slow in the presence of so42- and intermediate with cl- and and fast with and stimulation of na+-d-glucose uptake followed a similar anion conductive cl- flux had a low activation energy and was inhibited by suphhydryl the stilbene disulphonates (sits) and and the arylaminobenzoates diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (dpc) and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid intravesicular ca2+ and extravesicular nucleotides were without effect on conductive cl- these characteristics tentatively exclude some known cl- channels and leave members of the clc family as possible candidates responsible for the cl- conductance in brush-border
three-window transformation cross-talk correction for simultaneous dual-isotope we developed and tested a new transformation cross-talk correction method for simultaneous dual-isotope spect which uses information from three energy windows in a simultaneous 18f/99mtc cardiac phantom the method combines the previously reported technique and transformation cross-talk correction in the three-window the images from the third energy window are usually multiplied by a constant factor to obtain the estimates of the such an approach neglects differences in the spatial distribution between cross-talk photons in different energy the transformation method is based on the assumption that the which convert the images from one energy window into the other energy are these transformations were found by measuring the point-spread functions in different energy windows for both isotopes in the transformation method takes into account the different spatial distributions of the primary and scatter cross-talk photons in the different energy we are assuming that the imaging system and the image transformations between different energy windows are shift-invariant and the new method is described by two convolution equations applied in frequency in addition to the cross-talk the restoration filters were also applied to the resulting corrected the new method was performed on the simultaneous 18f/99mtc cardiac phantom three separate studies were acquired in our phantom two single-isotope studies and one dual-isotope the single-isotope images were used as the contrast between the left ventricle cavity and the myocardium was used in transaxial slices as a parameter to evaluate results of the dual-isotope correction method with the contrast improvement in the dual-isotope corrected images in both energy the 99mtc primary window (140 kev) and the 18f primary window (511 was the corrected dual-isotope image had a contrast of compared to which was the value in the noncorrected dual-isotope the improvement of the contrast in the dual-isotope 511-kev image was exclusively a result of the restoration the single-isotope 18f image had the same contrast for the 140-kev transaxial the contrast improved from to after cross-talk it finally reached after additional restoration the contrast in the single-isotope 99mtc image after restoration correction improved from to the three-window transformation dual-isotope correction method with restoration significantly improves the contrast between the left ventricle cavity and the myocardium of the simultaneous 18f/99mtc spect
arginine kinase expression and localization in growth cone migrating neuronal growth cones exert traction forces that are generated by atp-driven f-actin/myosin sustained generation of these forces may require an energy supply mediated by the guanidino creatine kinase and arginine we cloned and sequenced grasshopper arginine kinase and examined its expression during embryogenesis and its subcellular localization in vivo and in during the first half of arginine kinase is expressed selectively in a small percentage of ectodermal cells (dorsal closure in a small percentage of mesodermal cells (muscle and throughout the developing most of these cell types are including nascent muscle dorsal closure and many cns neuroblasts also strongly express arginine they are nonmotile but are undergoing repeated rounds of (atp-dependent) arginine kinase is colocalized with f-actin in a narrow band along the leading edges of lamellipodia of migrating in neurons undergoing arginine kinase is concentrated in growth cones and extends to the tips of the amount of arginine kinase varies widely between growth even between different growth cones of the same energy for growth cone migration appears to be mobilized by (1) selective expression of arginine kinase by (2) localization of arginine kinase within growth and (3) concentration of arginine kinase within specific growth depending on the traction forces being mobilization of guanidino kinases may participate in the selective growth of specific growth
regional metabolite concentrations in human brain as determined by quantitative localized proton the regional distribution of brain metabolites was studied in several cortical white and gray matter and thalamus of young adults with use of quantitative single-voxel proton mrs at whereas the neuronal compound n-acetylaspartate is distributed homogeneously throughout the n-acetylaspartylglutamate increases caudally and exhibits higher concentrations in white matter than in gray and glutamine are less concentrated in cortical white matter than in gray the highest creatine levels are found in parallel to the distribution of creatine kinase and energy-requiring processes in the also myo-inositol has highest concentrations in the choline-containing compounds exhibit a marked regional variability with again highest concentrations in cerebellum and lowest levels and a strong caudally decreasing gradient in gray the present findings neither support a metabolic gender difference (except for a higher myo-inositol level in parietal white matter of female subjects) nor a metabolic hemispheric
immature tubules are tolerant of oxygen the tolerance of immature tissues to injury has been noted over the past several traditional teaching relates this tolerance to energy derived from anaerobic this mini-review describes investigations of the hypothesis that the immature kidney is less susceptible to oxygen deprivation than the mature utilizing proximal tubule suspensions from immature and mature studies assessing atp levels as an index of cellular energy and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) release as a determinant of plasma membrane damage demonstrate the developing kidney is resistant to prolonged atp is maintained at twofold higher levels during anoxia in the immature tubule compared with the mature the contribution of anaerobic glycolysis to the tolerance of the immature renal tubules is investigated by two inhibitors of the glycolytic l-glucose and following 70%-90% inhibition of atp is decreased to similar levels in immature and mature immature tubules remain resistant to anoxic damage with no significant change in ldh enhanced glycolytic activity does not play a dominant role in the tolerance of the developing kidney to and this tolerance is not primarily dependent on preservation of cellular
during intense obese women rely more than lean women on aerobic a series of obese women (body mass index +/- were subjected to a protocol of intense exercise on a cycloergometer and compared with lean controls (body mass index 9 +/- physiological blood plasma oxygen consumption and co2 production were impedance-derived extracellular water and plasma changes in lactate and bicarbonate were used to determine changes in bicarbonate pools and lactate-displaced from these and respiratory the respiratory quotient was calculated and thence overall fuel anaerobic energy during exercise accounted for about of all energy consumed in the lean but only in the obese women fatigued at lower workloads and energy expenditure levels than did the and their lactate buildup was similar when compared on the basis of fat-free the data support the postulation of fatigue being triggered by a combination of stretched cardiovascular work would be the main factor for obese in part limiting lactate for lean the triggering factor for fatigue could be the loss of buffering but it is the combination of stretching cardiovascular exhaustion of glycogen and available glucose and increase in lactate/loss of bicarbonate buffer that determines the onset of
feeding response to mercaptoacetate in osborne-mendel and s5b/pl the purpose of this experiment was to determine if osborne-mendel (om) which are susceptible to dietary-induced and s5b/pl (s5b) which are resistant to dietary-induced differ in their feeding responses to mercaptoacetate which blocks fatty acid or 2-deoxy-d-glucose which blocks glucose 2dg (100 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg) increased food intake in both strains of rats on a high-fat diet (56% energy from mercaptoacetate (600 mumol/kg) increased food intake in om but not s5b rats on a high-fat when maintained on a low-fat diet (10% energy from ma (400 mumol/kg or 600 mumol/kg) stimulated food intake in om whereas s5b rats increased food intake only after the highest dose of ma (600 ma stimulated carbohydrate and protein intake in om rats maintained on a macronutrient selection whereas s5b rats maintained on this diet did not significantly increase intake of any macronutrient after these results demonstrate that om and s5b rats have a similar food intake response to 2dg but a dissimilar response to the variable response to ma in these strains may be due to a difference in peripheral or central signaling systems related to fatty acid oxidation or a difference in metabolic environments between the which in turn affects the feeding response to these studies suggest that a difference in control of fatty acid oxidation may account for the difference in susceptibility to obesity when eating a high-fat

flexibility of the b-dna effects of local and neighbouring sequences on pyrimidine-purine the structurally correlated dihedral angles epsilon and zeta are known for their large variability within the b-dna we have used molecular modelling to study both energetic and mechanical features of these variations which can produce bi/bii calculations were carried out on dna oligomers containing either ypr or rpy dinucleotides steps within various sequence the results indicate that cpa and cpg steps favour the bi/bii transition more than tpa or any rpy the stacking energy and its intra- and inter-strand components explain these analysis of neighbouring base pairs reveals that bi/bii transitions of cpg and cpa are easiest within (y)n(r)n these can also induce a large vibrational amplitude for tpa steps within the bi
neuroanatomical patterns of fos-like immunoreactivity induced by naltrexone in food-restricted and ad libitum fed chronic food restriction produces a variety of adaptive changes in physiology and behavior aimed at the preservation of energy the brain opioid system may be involved in the adaptation to food restriction since regional levels of opioid precursor and receptor binding have previously been in the present c-fos immunohistochemistry was used to localize cells that are released from opioid-mediated inhibition by naltrexone under conditions of food restriction and ad libitum in the majority of hypothalamic and forebrain areas fos-like immunoreactivity (fli) was higher in food-restricted rats regardless of injection this may reflect the persistent stress of underfeeding or the synchronizing effect of afternoon feeding on spontaneous c-fos mrna expression in food-restricted in two brain bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (bnst) and central amygdala naltrexone increased fli in ad libitum fed this result suggests the presence of tonic opioid secretion under basal conditions that is suppressed by food work in other laboratories indicates that anorectic agents consistently increase fli in bnst and in three brain regions--lateral dorsomedial (dmh) and arcuate hypothalamus (arc)--naltrexone increased fli in food-restricted this result suggests the presence of opioid secretion that is unique to the state of food the hypothalamic pattern of fli is discussed in terms of npy-opioid interactions that result from the arc response to changes in circulating corticosterone and leptin levels during food
quantification of anaerobic energy production during intense anaerobic energy production during supramaximal exercise has been estimated from muscle metabolic based on such measurements the anaerobic energy production was determined to be 63 and 189 mmol atp x kg(-1) for 60 and 142 s of exhaustive cycling these estimations do include release of lactate from the exercising the anaerobic production cannot be related to the work performed since the muscle biopsy sample may not be representative for the muscles involved in the and the total anaerobic energy production during whole body exercise cannot be determined because the mass of the muscles used is when a single muscle is the problems are with a one-legged knee-extensor exercise which uses a defined muscle the anaerobic energy production has been estimated to be 370 mmol atp x kg(-1) for a 192-s exhaustive exercise estimated pulmonary oxygen deficit based on an energy demand extrapolated from a linear relationship between exercise intensity and oxygen uptake at submaximal exercise does not appear to represent the anaerobic energy production during whole body
simulated front crawl swimming performance related to critical speed and critical competitive pool swimming events range in distance from 50 to 1500 given the difference in performance times (+/- 23-1000 the contribution of the aerobic and anaerobic energy systems changes considerably with race in training practice the regression line between swimming distance and time (distance = critical velocity x time + anaerobic swimming capacity) is used to determine the individual capacity of the aerobic and anaerobic metabolic although there is confidence that critical velocity and anaerobic swimming capacity are fitness measures that separate aerobic and anaerobic a firm theoretical basis for the interpretation of these results does not the purpose of this study was to evaluate the critical power concept and anaerobic swimming capacity as measures of the aerobic and anaerobic capacity using a modeling a systems model was developed that relates the mechanics and energetics involved in front crawl swimming from actual swimming flume the time dependent aerobic and anaerobic energy release was data derived from the literature were used to relate the energy cost of front crawl swimming to swimming a balance should exist between the energy cost to swim a distance in a certain time and the concomitant aerobic and anaerobic energy the ensuing model was used to predict performance times over a range of distances (50-1500 m) and to calculate the regression line between swimming distance and results and using a sensitivity it was demonstrated that the critical velocity is indicative for the capacity of the aerobic energy estimates of the anaerobic swimming were influenced by variations in both anaerobic and aerobic energy it was concluded that the anaerobic swimming capacity does not provide a reliable estimate of the anaerobic
effects of pulmonary embolism on pulmonary vascular impedance in dogs and pigs have been reported to present with a stronger pulmonary vascular reactivity than many other including we investigated the pulmonary vascular impedance response to autologous blood clot embolic pulmonary hypertension in anesthetized and ventilated minipigs (n = 6) and dogs (n = before compared with presented with higher mean pulmonary arterial pressure by an average of 9 a steeper slope of ppa-flow (q) and higher 0-hz impedance (z0) and first-harmonic impedance without significant differences in characteristic impedance and a lower ratio of pulsatile hydraulic power to total hydraulic embolic pulmonary hypertension (mean 40-55 mmhg) was associated with increased z0 and z1 in both but the minipigs had a steeper slope of ppa/q plots and an increased at identical q and minipigs still presented with higher z1 and zc and a lower ratio of pulsatile hydraulic power to total hydraulic the energy transmission defined as the hydraulic power in the measured waves divided by the hydraulic power in the forward was better preserved after embolism in no differences in wave reflection indexes were found before and after we conclude that compared with present with a higher pulmonary vascular resistance and reactivity and adapt to embolic pulmonary hypertension by an increased zc without earlier wave these differences allow for a reduced pulsatile component of hydraulic power a better energy transfer from the right ventricle to the pulmonary
the dead box protein a minimal kinetic and thermodynamic framework reveals coupled binding of rna and eif4a is the archetypal member of the dead box family of proteins and has been proposed to use the energy from atp hydrolysis to unwind structures in the regions of eukaryotic mrnas during translation as a step toward understanding the mechanism of action of this class of a minimal kinetic and thermodynamic framework for the rna-activated atpase function has been established for the affinity for ssrna is modulated by the binding of and the affinity of the complex for ssrna is approximately 40-fold higher than that of the the enzyme binds its substrates in a random contrary to previous neither atp binding nor hydrolysis is required for binding of single-stranded the presence or absence of the gamma-phosphate on the bound nucleotide acts as a switch that modulates the structure and ssrna the data presented in this and the following paper in this issue suggest that atp binding and hydrolysis produce a cycle of conformational and rna affinity changes in such cycles may be used by dead box proteins to transduce the energy from atp hydrolysis into physical thereby allowing each member of this family to rearrange its rna or

effect of mild hypothermia during and after transient in vitro ischemia on metabolic disturbances in hippocampal slices at different stages of in the present study the neuroprotective effect of mild hypothermia (decrease of temperature from 37 degrees c to 33 degrees c) during and after transient ischemia in brain tissue at different stages of development was tested in vitro by measuring energy glutamate release and protein biosynthesis rate (psr) in hippocampal slices were taken from immature (e40) and mature (e60) guinea pig fetuses and adult guinea the slices were exposed to ischemia-like conditions (oxygen/glucose ogd) for periods of between 10 to 40 min followed by a 2-h or 12-h recovery during mild hypothermia slowed down the depletion of energy stores only in slices from immature but had no effect on slices prepared from mature fetuses and adult hypothermia also reduced glutamate release significantly during oxygen/glucose lowering temperature to 33 degrees c had no effect on energy metabolism and only a minor effect on psr of slices from mature fetuses and adult animals subjected to 2 h of 12 h after ogd psr was markedly improved by mild hypothermia in slices from mature animals and in slices from adults that had been exposed to ogd for only 20 or 30 the inhibition of psr was more severe in the slices from adults than in those from mature fetuses subjected to the same duration of age- and temperature-related differences in glutamate release during ogd did not fully agree with corresponding disparities in the values for psr obtained 12 h after these results indicate that the neuroprotective effect of mild hypothermia was not mediated by a temperature-dependent retardation of the depletion of energy stores during age-related disparities in the vulnerability of the brain to ischemia and the neuroprotective efficiency of mild hypothermia appear to be only partially reflected by the varying levels of glutamate release during ischemia but best reflected by the extent of psr it is concluded that mild hypothermia may be a suitable therapeutical intervention for the suppression of hypoxic-ischemic cell damage during

photon energy a method to improve the effective energy resolution of gamma one of the major limitations of gamma cameras is their relatively poor energy the main practical consequence of this is that the detection of both scattered and unscattered photons in the photopeak energy affecting image contrast and makes the data inconsistent with the assumption of scatter-free projection data in reconstruction and attenuation correction we proposed a method to improve the effective energy resolution of scintigraphic this method is called photon energy recovery photon energy recovery is based on a spectral deconvolution analysis and uses iterative recurrent linear in per only required splitting the photopeak energy window into several subwindows and did not need list mode the method was fully photon energy recovery was quantitatively validated on 99mtc planar images using a monte carlo simulation and a real phantom and was illustrated by a bone the monte carlo simulation demonstrated that convergence was reached within relatively few (10-15) photon energy recovery led to a considerable quantitative improvement because the mean error between the photopeak energy window image and the true unscattered image was equal to (the mean error between one image and the true image was the mean of the differences between the two the difference is expressed as several where was the square root of the true whereas the mean error between the 140-kev per image and the true unscattered image was only equal to the true and per spectra were highly the real phantom data pointed out that the counts in the 140-kev per image calculated from the images acquired were not very different from the true counts given by the reference planar pelvic bone scintigraphy demonstrated the advantages of per because contrast increased when only unscattered photons were photon energy recovery is a stable and automated method that allows recovery of the correct value of the photon energy after a scintigraphic its ability to separate scattered from unscattered events has been quantitatively
basal metabolism does not account for high o2 consumption in stunned myocardial o2 consumption (mvo2) in stunned myocardium is relatively high compared with the reduced ventricular the mechanism of this could occur at different basal excitation-contraction and energy in one previously reported series on 12 blood-perfused rabbit left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in stunned myocardium were significantly decreased compared with whereas total mvo2 was the mvo2 for the unloaded contraction was overproportionately high for the decreased function in stunned and contractile efficiency was clearly to assess whether the basal metabolism specifically is elevated in stunned a second series (n = 14) with a similar protocol was performed in this basal mvo2 after kcl arrest +/- g-1) was significantly lower than that measured after kcl arrest +/- g-1) in an additional series on nonischemic hearts (n = our conclusion is that basal mvo2 in stunned myocardium is not thus this o2-consuming portion of total mvo2 is not responsible for the inefficiency in stunned a occurs at the level of both excitation-contraction coupling and force development by the contractile
changes in carbohydrate metabolism of testicular germ cells during meiosis in the a study was undertaken to estimate the activities of the key enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway and the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle in purified rat spermatocytes and which have been shown to die in glucose-containing medium and require lactate/pyruvate for maintaining normal atp the aim was to elucidate the changes in the glycolytic and oxidative potential of germ cells undergoing pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids from adult rat testis were purified to approximately 90% purity by trypsin digestion followed by a combination of centrifugal elutriation and percoll density gradient after the purity and viability of these cells had been their contents of lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) and ldh-x of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase of the pentose phosphate pathway and citrate malate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase of the tca cycle were these enzymes were also estimated in epididymal spermatozoa for comparison with the testicular germ the results indicate greater activity of glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway enzymes in spermatocytes than in which exhibited greater activity of tca cycle enzymes than the the difference in activity was statistically significant for most of the enzymes in spermatozoa exhibited markedly greater activity of glycolytic enzymes and significantly lower activity of pentose phosphate pathway and tca cycle enzymes than did the testicular germ we conclude that the unusual dependence of spermatids exclusively on lactate may be due to their lower glycolytic whereas spermatocytes with comparatively greater glycolytic activity have an intermediate dependence on lactate and are therefore able to utilise or while retaining a better ability to utilise spermatozoa with the greatest glycolytic potential and the lowest tca cycle activity appear to be to utilise exclusively glucose/fructose for

molecular mechanisms for cooperative folding of the folding of single-domain globular proteins exhibits the character of first-order or two-state the origin of such high cooperativity in relatively small polymer systems is still not well the statistical mechanics of protein folding has been studied extensively with simple protein models such as short cubic-lattice chains with contact-based while many valuable insights about protein folding were gained with such some concerns have also that they lack the character of protein backbones whose interactions would limit the folding patterns of a comparative study of the conventional cubic-lattice chain model and a fine-grained more realistic lattice protein model with both backbone and side-chain interactions is carried it is found even though both types of models exhibit a cooperative two-state folding transition to the native structure with optimized force the character and origin of cooperativity of the two models are in the simple contact-based the free-energy barrier occurs at the low end of the energy and the cooperativity arises from a concerted formation of native contacts among many residues in a compact in the other more complicated the free-energy barrier occurs in the intermediate energy and the folding cooperativity arises from collective orientational arrangements of locally structured units in semi-open conformational on the basis of these two limiting molecular mechanisms for protein folding which can be used for analyzing the folding process of real copyright 1998 academic press

hydration and dehydration behavior of aspartame previous studies have shown that aspartame in the solid state can exist as a hemihydrate which occurs in two different polymorphic forms (i and the present work shows that equilibration of either hemihydrate at 25 degrees c with water vapor at relative humidities > or = 58% or with liquid water produces a upon subjecting each of these crystalline hydrates to increasing the same crystalline anhydrate is formed which thermally cyclizes at a higher temperature to form the known compound the activation energy of the cyclization reaction appears to depend on the degree of crystallinity of the anhydrate that is formed at a lower on increasing the temperature of the a hemihydrate intervenes before the anhydrate is this intervening hemihydrate is similar to the commercial form (ii) of aspartame hemihydrate but exhibits greater amorphous the techniques employed were karl fischer powder x-ray differential scanning thermogravimetric solid-state 13c nuclear magnetic resonance and fourier transform infrared absorption

channelling free energy into work in biological the process by which free energy from atp or an ion gradient is coupled to work--either osmotic by a membrane or mechanical by a molecular motor--as well as the development of force by a molecular can be explained by mechanisms dependent on substrate binding coupling involves a reaction sequence that combines the driving and driven reactions and that is controlled at switch points where the mobility of the coupling protein and its specificity in binding and catalysis can be abruptly the altered state is an intermediate (or transition state) in the coupled the unaltered state an intermediate in the uncoupled reaction the balance between these which is determined by the increase in substrate binding energy in the decides the relative importance of the coupled and uncoupled on this basis a general expression for switching may be the tightness of coupling is limited by a ratio of substrate dissociation constants before and after a controlling change in rate(coupled)/rate(uncoupled) < or = kinitial state/kfinal when binding energy is used in this way to distort the conformation of a mechanical work is the work is internal but becomes external if the protein is connected to an external external force f multiplied by distance is then limited by a ratio of substrate dissociation constants before and after the conformational w = fd < rt in(kinitial state/kfinal the ratios of dissociation estimated from published values of the force exerted by molecular are > 1 x 10(4) for myosin and > 2 x 10(4) for from the tightness of coupling of the anion exchange carrier of red cells the ratio of constants for coupling is > or = 4 x these increments can be accounted for by conversion of a surface complex to an enclosed as in chelate the work done by an atp-driven motor is limited by the free energy of atp but the force developed is independent of the atp and comes from binding energy with either the driving or driven
calculation of standard transformed gibbs energies and standard transformed enthalpies of biochemical the standard gibbs energies of formation and standard enthalpies of formation of species involved in biochemical reactions are used to calculate standard transformed gibbs energies of formation and standard transformed enthalpies of formation of 53 reactants (sums of species) at ph and ionic strengths of and 25 the standard transformed gibbs energies of formation are used to calculate apparent equilibrium constants for 22 biochemical reactions for which apparent equilibrium constants have been determined close to these this comparison is generally satisfactory given the differences in experimental the transformed formation properties for the 53 reactants make it possible to calculate transformed formation properties for other reactants involved in biochemical reactions with some of these this is illustrated by calculating standard transformed gibbs energies of formation for 11 more reactants without information on the standard gibbs energies of formation of the the list of 64 reactants for which standard transformed gibbs energies of formation are presented can be considerably the use of tables of standard transformed gibbs energies of formation to store information on apparent equilibrium constants is more efficient than simply storing apparent equilibrium constants because a reactant can be looked up in a table and may be involved in hundreds of the effects of magnesium ions on several reactions involving atp are the advantages of using enzyme-catalyzed reactions for determining thermodynamic properties of complicated molecules in aqueous solution are copyright 1998 academic

on compensator design for photon beam intensity-modulated conformal recently the compensator has been shown to be an in expensive and reliable dose delivery device for photon beam intensity-modulated radiation therapy the goal of imrt compensator design is to produce an optimized primary fluence profile at the surface obtained from the optimization in this paper some of the problems associated with imrt compensator specifically the beam perturbations caused by the are a simple formula is derived to calculate the optimal compensator thickness profile from an optimized primary fluence the change of characteristics of a 6 mv beam caused by the introduction of cerrobend compensators in the beam is investigated using omega monte carlo it is found that the compensator significantly changes the energy spectrum and the mean energy of the primary photons at the beam hardening does not have as significant an effect on the percent depth dose as it does on the energy we conclude that in most situations the beam hardening effect can be ignored during compensator design and dose the influence of the compensator on the contaminant electron buildup dose is found to be small and independent of the compensator thickness of it can be ignored in the compensator design and included as a correction into the final dose the scattered photons from the compensator are found to have no effect on the surface these photons produce a uniform low fluence distribution at the which is independent of compensator this is also true for very large fields and extremely asymmetric and nonuniform compensator thickness compared to the primary the scattered photons have much larger angular spread and similar energy spectrum at the these characteristics allow the compensator thickness profile and the dose distribution to be calculated from the optimized fluence profile of primary without considering the scattered
studies on fusobacteria associated with periodontal the physiological and metabolic characteristics of representative isolates of the various subspecies of fusobacterium nucleatum were investigated by growing them in continuous culture in behaving almost these organisms were found to obtain energy from the fermentation of simple carbohydrates such as glucose or fructose or from the fermentation of certain amino free or in the form of small the latter can be attacked by aminopeptidase activity which was shown to be essential for the growth of the organism in an environment lacking fermentable carbohydrate and free amino acids but replete with small this metabolic versatility may explain the presence of nucleatum in both supra- and sub-gingival dental plaque and why it is often found together with organisms such as porphyromonas gingivalis which display powerful endopeptidase using the technique of allozyme the current subspeciation of nucleatum was shown to be of doubtful validity and based upon physiological and metabolic for differences in pathogenicity between isolates was not while this organism is a member of various bacterial consortia associated with periodontal its contribution to the disease process remains
dose-related effects of shock waves on rabbit tendo a sonographic and histological we aimed to determine whether extracorporeal shock waves of varying intensity would damage the intact tendo achillis and paratenon in a rabbit we used 42 female new zealand white rabbits randomly divided into four groups as group a received 1000 shock-wave impulses of an energy flux density of group b 1000 impulses of group c 1000 impulses of and group d was a control sonographic and histological evaluation showed no changes in group and transient swelling of the tendon with a minor inflammatory reaction in group group c had formation of paratendinous fluid with a significant increase in the anteroposterior diameter of the in this group there were marked histological changes with increased eosin fibrinoid fibrosis in the paratenon and infiltration of inflammatory we conclude that there are dose-dependent changes in the tendon and paratenon after extracorporeal shock-wave therapy and that energy flux densities of over mj/mm should not be used clinically in the treatment of tendon

energy and protein metabolism between 3 and 6 weeks of age of male broiler chickens selected for growth rate or for improved food a new open-circuit respiration unit consisting of 6 respiration gas analysis unit and data-acquisition system is briefly energy and protein metabolism in broiler lines selected for improved food efficiency (fc) or for growth rate (gl) were measured weekly from 3 to 6 weeks of gross and apparent metabolisable energy intake per kg was on average higher for gl than for fc chickens without differences in fed and fasted heat production per kg did not differ between the fc chickens retained less energy per kg than gl fc chickens deposited much less of the retained energy as fat than their gl counterparts and also showed greater protein conversion the leaner composition of the body weight gain in fc chickens was confirmed by the estimated lower fat deposition per kg and by the lower protein
[the effect of lactation time on the macronutrient and mineral composition of milk from venezuelan human milk is considered the ideal food for the infant and it has been extensively used to estimate its nutrient the objective of this paper was to determine the effect of lactation time on the macronutrient an mineral content of milks obtained from venezuelan women and also to compare this with the established nutrient requirements of the for this purpose 83 milk samples from 45 low income mothers were analyzed at the colostrum (48 h to 54 d) and mature states of lactation and 6 the results showed that colostrum had a higher protein and a lower fat content than mature milks whereas its content of energy and carbohydrate was similar to mature the iron and calcium content of the milk remained unchanged during the whole study whereas zn and cu decreased and increased with lactation time in phosphorous and magnesium increased up to 3rd month of lactation and remained constant there the macronutrient content of 850 ml of the analyzed milk almost completely fulfilled the daily infant requirements established in the us (rda) and canada the mineral content of this volume of milk however was insufficient to cover the infants requirements particularly those established in the the most notorious deficiency in these milks was in fe since they could fulfill only 11% the infants rda for this the infant mineral requirements established in canada are substantially lower than those defined in the us and therefore the analyzed milks could totally fulfill the canadian infant daily requirements of fe and ca and more than 70% and 80% of the requirements of zn and in the results of this study showed that the nutrient content of the analyzed milks agree well with those reported in the literature for women from different parts of the world including developed and underdeveloped at the same time they pointed out the differences in the definition of the infant nutrient requirements set by different countries and also emphasize the fact that human which by definition is the natural source of nutrients for the human infant apparently is incapable of fulfilling its daily

pre-treatment energy status of primary rat tumours as the best predictor of response to 5-fluorouracil a magnetic resonance spectroscopy study in fluorine-19 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (19f-m rs) studies of the pharmacokinetics of the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (fu) in patients at several clinical centres have shown that increased tumour retention of fu is associated with patient the mechanism of this increased tumour retention (fu trapping) is we used a pre-clinical model to investigate whether other mrs-measurable parameters would correlate with the response to fu treatment help elucidate the mechanism(s) involved in fu mrs spectra were obtained using a double-tuned (31p/19f) surface coil from 29 n-methyl-n-nitrosourea-induced primary rat 31p-mrs spectra were acquired immediately prior to and at h post-treatment with a bolus injection of fu (100 mg/ 19f-mrs spectra were acquired during the intervening period for measurement of the tumour uptake and retention of fu and of its metabolism to the cytotoxic fluoronucleotides from these four parameters were tumour ph and energy status (ntp/pi) before total fu and fu anabolism to fnuct (expressed as micromoles per gram per in tumour response was determined at 7 days post-treatment by measurement of the percentage of change in tumour weight and was classified according to standard oncological criteria as progressive (p) for a > or =25% remissive (r) for a > or =50% decrease or stable (s) for values lying between these analysis of variance (anova) for statistical assessment revealed that groups s and r were not distinguishable using the mrs although when s and r were combined as one group of non-progressive disease n = both the ntp/pi ratio and the total fnuct formed were significantly greater (p = than those observed in the p group (n = considering all 29 linear regression showed that there were positive significant correlations between the ntp/pi ratio and (a) the percentage of response (p = (b) the pre-treatment ph (p = and (c) fu retention (p = but not fnuct formation (p = unlike results reported in the the percentage of response and fu retention were neither significantly correlated (p = nor associated when groups p and npd were compared (p = exact was significantly associated with as was the ntp/pi ratio (p < or = combination of fnuct with the ntp/pi ratio increased the significance of the association with response (p = exact our results indicate that in this particular model the pre-treatment tumour ntp/pi ratio was the best predictor of response to a bolus injection of rather than fnuct formation or fu an elevated ntp/pi ratio could reflect a well-vascularised tumour with an improved capacity for energy-dependent fu uptake and metabolism to suggesting that further investigation of this parameter could be an important line of which may aid the identification of tumours likely to be sensitive to fu chemotherapy in the
[tissue physiological and pathophysiologic aspects in intensive continuous oxygen supply to the tissues is one of the many important factors in intensive as a basic requirement for the structure and function of higher developed organisms energy production by oxydative metabolism is of outstanding because there is no significant storage of energy and anaerobic metabolism is the determinants of oxygen supply--blood flow and oxygen content--are well the system stands out for its extensive ability to compensate nevertheless one has to bear in mind also rather trivial disturbances like insufficient respiration and absolute values of global provide no information on the oxygen supply of individual organs that are variably susceptible to regional perfusion and tissue respiration are influenced by various together with systemic components the physiologic oxygen transport along the oxygen cascade follows regardless of their position on the oxygen cascade malfunctions of oxygenation impair first the function and eventually the structure of the an utilisation block on the cellular level can prevent sufficient energy production despite optimized oxygen the damage of reperfusion can intensify the effects of typical haemodynamic patterns follow the tissue for maintaining an equilibrium between oxygen demand and supply it is important that oxygen consumption is also influenced by numerous only when an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand--an oxygen debt--is realized at an early the critically ill patient can be saved from irreversible in the field of intensive care the frequently latent tissue hypoxia is often a result of the chronic oxygen debt of particularly vulnerable considering those aspects the intestinal mucosa is particularly suited for the monitoring of tissue oxygenation in the critically ill
energy generation in hypertrophied postischemic feasibility of prolonged inotropic stimulation with dopamine in hypertrophied reperfused left non-hypertrophied reversibly injured postischemic myocardium can be stimulated for a prolonged period without detrimental since no data on hypertrophied myocardium are our aim was to examine the effects of a prolonged postischemic positive inotropic stimulation on moderately hypertrophied left using a langendorff-type isovolumically contracting isolated heart moderately hypertrophied (+50% of ventricular mass) hearts from spontaneously hypertensive rats (shr) were investigated and compared to data from non-hypertrophied hearts of normotensive a 30 minutes noflow ischemia was and in the postischemic period dopamine was continuously administered for 20 minutes in order to stimulate the postischemic hearts to the control level of data were compared to postischemic hearts without stimulation and to non-ischemic after 50 minutes of reperfusion and cessation of the catecholamine steady state maximum contractile and high energy phosphates were 30 minutes ischemia followed by 50 minutes reperfusion caused a significant reduction in developed lvp to +/- in dp/dtmax was reduced to +/- after cessation of dopamine stimulation developed lvp was +/- and dp/dtmax +/- in the double product was identically reduced in all postischemic the contractile reserve was comparable in stimulated and non-stimulated postischemic shr in hypertrophied atp was reduced to +/- mumol/gww (non-ischemic controls +/- mumol/gww) in unstimulated and to +/- mumol/gww in stimulated postischemic comparably the ischemia-induced reduction in atp in non-hypertrophied myocardium was similar results were obtained for adp and creatine phosphate levels were normal in stimulated and non-stimulated postischemic myocardium of hypertrophied and non-hypertrophied these results indicate that prolonged stimulation of stunned hypertrophied myocardium is feasible without detrimental effects on post-stimulation contractile the energy generating apparatus is capable to deliver sufficient energy during stimulation of stunned hypertrophied
amphiphile induced echinocyte-spheroechinocyte transformation of red blood cell a possible physical explanation of the echinocyte -spheroechinocyte red blood cell (rbc) shape transformation induced by the intercalation of amphiphilic molecules into the outer layer of the rbc plasma membrane bilayer is the stable rbc shape is determined by the minimization of the membrane elastic consisting of the bilayer bending the bilayer relative stretching energy and the skeleton shear elastic it is shown that for a given relative cell volume the calculated number of echinocyte spicula increases while their size decreases as the number of the intercalated amphiphilic molecules in the outer layer of the cell membrane bilayer is which is in agreement with experimental it is show that the equilibrium difference between the outer and the inner membrane leaflet areas of the stable rbc shapes increases if the amount of the intercalated amphiphiles is thereby verifying theoretically the original bilayer couple hypothesis of sheetz and singer (1974) and evans
retention of nadph-linked quinone reductase activity in an aldo-keto reductase following mutation of the catalytic aldo-keto reductases (akr) are monomeric oxidoreductases that retain a conserved catalytic tetrad and his) at their active sites in which the tyr acts as a general acid-base in rat liver 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase a well-characterized the catalytic tyrosine is tyr this enzyme displays a high catalytic efficiency for a common akr substrate y55f and y55s mutants of 3alpha-hsd reduced with high kcat this is the first report whereby the invariant catalytic tyrosine of an akr has been mutated with retention of kcat values similar to wild-type the y55f and y55s mutants displayed narrow substrate specificity and reduced select aromatic quinones and kcat versus ph profiles for steroid oxidoreduction catalyzed by wild-type 3alpha-hsd exhibited a single ionizable group with a pk= which has been assigned to tyr this group was not evident in the kcat versus ph profiles for 10-pq reduction catalyzed by either wild-type or the tyr 55 mutant indicating that the protonation state of tyr 55 is unimportant for wild-type and the active-site mutants and k84m showed the presence of a new titratable group with a pkb = the group being titrated is not part of the all the mutants decreased kcat/km considerably more than they decreased the k84r mutant demonstrated a 30-fold decrease in the ph-independent value of kcat but 2200-fold decrease in the ph-independent value of this suggests that all the tetrad residues influence quinone binding and that lys 84 plays a dominant role in maintaining proper substrate using wild-type the energy of activation (ea) for reduction was approximately 11 kcal/mol less than steroid the ea for reduction was unchanged in the tyr 55 suggesting that the reaction proceeds through the same low-energy barrier in the wild-type enzyme and these the retention of quinone reductase activity in this akr in the absence of tyr 55 with kcat versus ph rate profiles and activation energies identical to wild-type enzyme suggests that quinone reduction occurs via a mechanism that differs from 3-ketosteroid in this the electron donor (nadph) and acceptor (o-quinone) are bound in close which permits hydride transfer without formal protonation of the acceptor carbonyl by tyr this represents a rare example where one enzyme can catalyze the same chemical reaction (carbonyl reduction) by either acid catalysis or by a propinquity effect and where these two mechanisms can be discriminated by site-directed

serum food intake and preferences for sugar and fat in obese to examine the association of leptin with food intake and preferences for sugar and fat in obese food intake and preferences for sugar and fat were measured in 35 obese women by a four-day food record and three hedonic high fasting serum leptin concentration adjusted for body fat mass and dietary underreporting was associated with low dietary energy and fat in trends towards lower preference for chocolate as well as for the taste of low-sugar mixture were observed in those with higher leptin high serum leptin concentration could be associated in obese women with lower dietary energy and fat and possibly with the lower preference for these findings need to be verified in further human
putting the shoulder to the a new biomechanical model for the shoulder the least successfully modeled joint complex has been the in multi-segmented mathematical shoulder models rigid beams (the bones) act as a series of columns or levers to transmit forces or loads to the axial forces passing through the almost frictionless joints always be directed perfectly perpendicular to the joints as only loads directed at right angles to the surfaces could transfer across frictionless loads transmitted to the axial skeleton would have to pass through the moving ribs or the weak jointed clavicle and then through the a new model of the shoulder based on the tension icosahedron described by buckminster is proposed that permits the compression loads passing through the arm and shoulder to be transferred to the axial skeleton through its soft in this model the scapula in the tension network of shoulder girdle muscles just as the hub of the wire wheel is suspended in its tension network of with this construct inefficient beams and levers are a more energy load hierarchical system is
the effect of walker-256 tumour development upon kupffer cell the liver plays a central role in the establishment and maintenance of the cachectic state in rats bearing extra-hepatic kupffer which as show a strong relationship between metabolism and function could be involved in the alterations observed in the disruption of many functions of the organ as a to assess whether the metabolic/functional pattern of kupffer cells was altered by cachexia we have investigated the utilization of glutamine and palmitate by the cells from tumour-bearing and control we have found an enhanced utilization of the three substrates by the cells from tumour-bearing rats as compared with which was related to greater energy production through the krebs cycle and enhanced production of precursors for the synthesis of the many substances the cells secrete when the use of palmitate as substrate was also augmented in these in the opposition to the observation in stimulated peritoneal the availability of palmitate was not associated with a reduction of glucose or glutamine the cycle of free fatty acids/triacyglycerol in kupffer cells from tumour-bearing rats was also found to be as was hydrogen peroxide taken together the results suggest an increased utilization of substrates for both energy production and for synthetic processes nadph for hydrogen peroxide
dietary protein restriction alters glucose but not protein metabolism in non-insulin-dependent diabetes we determined whether a customary diet high or low in protein (1) influences postabsorptive amino acid nitrogen (n) and hepatic glucose output (hgo) in normal subjects or patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) or (2) alters blood glucose levels in eight normal young adults and five obese middle-aged persons with niddm consumed low-protein g/kg lean body mass [lbm]) or high-protein g/kg lbm) diets at maintenance energy for consecutive 7-day fasting and average blood glucose and n balance were measured the level of dietary protein had no effect on the basal plasma leucine rate of appearance (ra) or urinary 3-methylhistidine excretion in either subject basal leucine oxidation (and by whole-body amino acid catabolism) was reduced on the low-protein diet but basal hgo was and although exogenous glucose effectively suppressed it did not reduce leucine oxidation with either after adaptation to the low-protein n balance in both the normal and niddm subjects was close to the low-protein diet reduced the fasting and daily blood glucose of the diabetic subjects by approximately 2 mmol/l (p < we conclude that physiologic variation in dietary protein does not affect basal whole-body protein turnover or hgo in either normal young adults or obese middle-aged niddm protein restriction to the level of the average daily requirement significantly reduces postabsorptive and average daily blood glucose concentrations in persons with
relation between circulating leptin concentrations and appetite during a moderate energy deficit in women [see on the basis of observations in leptin is thought to play a key role in the regulation of energy expenditure and food but less is known of its influence on ingestive behavior and energy balance in we examined the effect in women of a chronic energy deficit on plasma leptin concentrations and self-reported appetite and explored possible relations between leptin and appetite twelve healthy women (body mass in 23-37) participated in a metabolic ward study in which 3 wk of neutral energy balance was followed by 12 wk of energy deficit (energy intake reduced by 2 mj/d and energy expenditure increased by body weight and composition were fasting leptin concentrations were measured 4 and feelings of desire to and prospective consumption were monitored hourly throughout the day on 7 selected adiposity-adjusted leptin decreased by 54% after 1 wk of a moderate energy deficit and remained low after 6 and 12 leptin was associated with self-reported desire to and prospective consumption (range of to p < the greatest hunger increase coincided with the largest percentage drop in circulating leptin and the lowest final leptin the relation between leptin and hunger was not influenced by amount of weight or body fat these findings support the idea that leptin is a physiologic regulator of hunger during energy deficits in the role of leptin in the long-term regulation of food intake warrants further
energy balance and thermogenesis in rats consuming nonstarch polysaccharides of various the equivalents of dietary and available carbohydrate as fuels for maintenance (kj apparent metabolizable energy/kj maintenance requirement) are known from classical experiments and are similar across that for nonstarch polysaccharide (nsp) is our objectives were to determine the energy equivalent of nsp and the thermic responses to in a randomized block 120 rats were treated in groups of 10 for 28 d with a basal diet (control) supplemented with starch and 10 different nsp treatments in amounts between 38 and 92 g/kg basal cellulose and starch were thermic deduced from body-composition changes and modeling of energy and energy and substrate excretion were nsp had fermentabilities between and g/g partial digestible and net metabolizable energy values of nsp were closely 51% of apparent metabolizable energy from nsp (fermentable gross energy) met maintenance diet (energy)-induced thermogenesis (dit) was evident from whole fermentable nsp supplied net metabolizable energy and caused after dit and fermentation were accounted nsp-induced thermogenesis was generally -2+/-4% (x+/-sem) of gross nsp except for an outlying pectic which was 33% (p< the energy equivalent of nsp was 196 (100/51) compared with and 100 for and from the classical with the exception of pectic nsp does not induce thermogenesis in excess of that associated with dit and
