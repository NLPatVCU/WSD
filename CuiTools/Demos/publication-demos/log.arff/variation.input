[adolescent mortality in an urban area of southeastern mortality among adolescents resident in the municipal district of state of according to age group (10 to 14 and 15 to 19 occupation and cause of during the period from 1984 to was the mortality data were obtained from death certificates and the population estimates were based upon census there was great variation in the mortality rates of the years the mortality was greater among the males of the older age group (15 to 19 including both students and there was predominance of external causes of mortality which suggests the need for further studies its determining the data indicate that health programs targeted at regarding their families and community should be developed since these are avoidable causes of
a modification in restriction pattern of the plasmodium falciparum pf60 multigene family associated with a specific antigenic variation switch in the palo alto the wide occurrence of molecular rearrangements associated with expression of specific members within multigene families led us to investigate whether this also happens during antigenic variation of malaria we have investigated here the pf60 multigene family restriction patterns of four distinct variants of the plasmodium falciparum palo alto line propagated in saimiri the o and its cloned oc variant both express the o while the r variant (derived from o parasites) and the vc variant (derived from oc parasites) express distinct we show that a specific modification of the restriction pattern could be associated with antigenic switching in this the dna of the variants which expressed the o serotype (o and oc) had a specific kb hind iii/eco ri restriction fragment which was absent from the r or vc parasite whereas both r and vc dna presented a kb hind iii/eco ri restriction which was absent from the o and oc these results indicate that both expression and silencing of the o serotype were associated with specific restriction suggesting that some molecular rearrangement or some modification of the dna might control expression of the variant surface antigen in malaria

variations in oxidative enzyme type profiles among prenatal rat lumbar we have used cytochrome oxidase histochemical staining to evaluate whether immature rat lumbar motoneurons show intrinsic separation into high or low oxidative enzyme relative oxidative enzyme levels are frequently used to help differentiate between muscle fibres of various types and to differentiate between mature here we show a wide variation in motoneuron cytochrome oxidase levels from prenatal although the range of staining levels as measured densitometrically is greater for mature than for prenatal we find variation in cytochrome oxidase levels among motoneurons prior to the formation of mature patterns of connectivity or electrical and conclude therefore that this differentiation is unlikely to have arisen by differential usage and probably arose as a function of cell

meta-analysis of the effects of alcohol dehydrogenase genotype on alcohol dependence and alcoholic liver the purpose of this paper is to assemble and evaluate existing data on the effect of genetic variation in adh2 and adh3 on the risk of alcohol and on the risk of alcoholic liver calculations of odds ratios and their confidence and tests for heterogeneity of the results from the available have been it is clear that possession of the adh2-2 allele decreases the risk of alcohol but it increases the risk of alcoholic liver disease among adh3 variation also has significant effects on alcohol which may be due to linkage to the adh3 effect differs significantly between asian and european therefore adh genotype has substantial effects on risk of alcohol dependence and alcoholic liver but more work is needed on the generalizability of these findings to non-asian and on possible
interlaboratory and intralaboratory variabilities in the environmental lead proficiency analytical testing (elpat) the environmental lead proficiency analytical testing (elpat) program evaluates over 400 laboratories that perform lead measurements in and a previous national institute for occupational safety and health based on the elpat data over a 3-year period found no large biases among common hotplate and microwave digestion but did detect small consistent bias between two common instrumental this study expands on the earlier study by examining the total sample variability and its variation components (interlaboratory and a correlation model was used to separate the variation components by estimating a variation the correlation model leads to a more general approach than a sample pairing technique developed by this study found no significant evidence that the relative contribution of intralaboratory and interlaboratory variability to total variability changes with lead loading there were no significant differences in the relative contribution of variation components among three most commonly used analytical methods (combinations of sample preparation techniques and instrumental the interlaboratory relative standard deviation is about times the intralaboratory relative standard both variation components are important parts of total variation although the laboratory-to-laboratory (including analyst-to-analyst) difference is greater than the within laboratory (including sample-to-sample)
dependency of cortisol suppression on the administration time of inhaled corticosteroids [published erratum appears in j clin pharmacol 1997 endogenous cortisol suppression is one of the major systemic side effects of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of a previously developed pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic approach was used to evaluate the influence of administration time on the cumulative cortisol suppression (ccs) after single doses of the inhaled corticosteroids flunisolide and fluticasone administration time-dependent simulations of ccs were performed with drug-specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters obtained from previous clinical both drugs showed similar diurnal variation in dependent on the administration with maximum suppression when administered in the early morning at approximately 3 the optimum administration time for minimized ccs was in the afternoon but was shifted from 3 pm for fluticasone propionate to later time points around 7 pm for probably because of the shorter terminal elimination half-life of regarding peak to trough ccs after fluticasone propionate showed only half the administration time dependency as after the ratio between ccs after flunisolide and after fluticasone propionate also followed administration time-dependent this led to the conclusion that administration time has to be considered as a pivotal influential factor in clinical studies comparing ccs among different inhaled
phenotypic variation in transgenic tobacco expressing mutated geminivirus movement/pathogenicity (bc1) tobacco plants were transformed with the movement protein (pathogenicity) gene (bc1) from tomato mottle geminivirus using agrobacterium-mediated different transgenic tobacco lines that expressed high levels of the bc1 protein had phenotypes ranging from plants with severe stunting and leaf mottling (resembling geminivirus symptoms) to plants with no visible the sequence data for the bc1 transgene from the transgenic plants with the different phenotypes indicated an association of spontaneously mutated forms of the bc1 gene in the transformed tobacco with phenotype one mutated transgene associated with an asymptomatic phenotype had a major deletion at the c terminus of 119 amino acid residues with a recombination resulting in the addition of 26 amino acid residues of unidentified this mutated bc1 attenuated the phenotypic expression of the symptomatic bc1 in a tobacco line containing both copies of the bc1 another mutated form of the bc1 gene amplified from an multicopy transgenic tobacco plant did not induce symptoms when transiently expressed in tobacco via a virus the symptom attenuation in the transgenic tobacco by the asymptomatic bc1 may involve trans-dominant negative
mechanisms by which thrombolytic therapy results in nonuniform lysis and residual thrombus after a transport-reaction model describing penetration of plasmin by diffusion and permeation into a dissolving fibrin gel was solved numerically to explore mechanisms that lead to the formation and growth of dissolution fingers through blood clots during thrombolytic under conditions of fluid permeation driven by arterial small random spatial variations in the initial fibrin density within clots (+/-4 to 25% peak variations) were predicted by the simulation to result in dramatic dissolution fingers that grew in with in vitro video microscopy revealed that the shape of the proximal face of a fibrin when deformed by pressure-driven led to lytic breakthrough in the center of the consistent with model predictions of increased velocities in this region leading to computer simulation of lysis of fibrin retracted by platelets (where more permeable regions are expected in the middle of the clot due to retraction) predicted cannulation of the clot during this annular thrombus was predicted to lyse more because radial pressure gradients to drive inner clot permeation were quite in conjunction with kinetic models of systemic pharmacodynamics and plasminogen activation a two-dimensional transport-reaction model can facilitate the prediction of the time and causes of clot poor and embolism during

changes in serum concentrations of growth insulin-like growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins 1 and 3 and urinary growth hormone excretion during the menstrual few studies exist on the physiological changes in the concentrations of growth hormone insulin-like growth factors (igf) and igf-binding proteins (igfbp) within the menstrual and some controversy we therefore decided to study the impact of endogenous sex steroids on the gh-igf-igfbp axis during the ovulatory menstrual cycle in 10 healthy women (aged 18-40 blood sampling and urinary collection was performed every morning at 0800 h for 32 consecutive every second day the subjects were fasted overnight before blood follicle stimulating luteinizing hormone sex hormone-binding dihydroepiandrosterone sulphate and gh were determined in all whereas insulin and igfbp-1 were determined in fasted samples serum igf-i concentrations showed some fluctuation during the menstrual with significantly higher values in the luteal phase compared to the proliferative phase (p < mean individual variation in igf-i concentrations throughout the menstrual cycle was (sd range there were no cyclic changes in igfbp-3 serum concentrations and no differences in igfbp-3 concentrations between the luteal and the proliferative mean individual variation in igfbp-3 concentrations throughout the menstrual cycle was (sd range igfbp-1 concentrations were inversely associated with insulin and showed a significant pre-ovulatory increase that returned to baseline at the day of the lh fasting insulin concentrations showed large fluctuations throughout the menstrual cycle without any distinct cyclic no cyclic changes in urinary gh excretion during menstrual cycle were we conclude although igf-i concentrations are dependent on the phase of the menstrual the variation in igf-i concentrations throughout the menstrual cycle is relatively the menstrual cycle does not need to be considered when evaluating igf-i or igfbp-3 serum values in women suspected to have gh
stability of motor-unit force thresholds in the decerebrate to further test the hypothesis that some fixed property of motoneurons determines their recruitment we quantified the variation in force threshold (ft) for motoneurons recruited in muscle stretch reflexes in the decerebrate motor axons supplying the medial gastrocnemius (mg) muscle were penetrated with micropipettes and physiological properties of the motoneuron and its muscle the motor were defined as the amount of mg force produced when the isolated motor unit was was measured from 20 to 93 consecutive stretch trials for 29 motor trials were selected for limited variation in base force and rate of rise of which have been shown to covary with and in peak stretch which gives some index of motor-pool under these restricted large variation in ft would have been inconsistent with the analysis of the variation in ft employed the coefficient of variation because of the tendency for ft variance and mean to increase we found that cv was distributed with a median value of 10% and with only 2 of 29 units exceeding some of this variation was associated with measurement error and with intertrial fluctuations in and the rate of change of muscle cv was not significantly correlated with motor-unit axonal conduction contraction or in three cases ft was measured simultaneously from two motor units in the same stretch changes in recruitment order were rarely observed (5 of 121 stretch even when ft ranges for units in a pair we suggest that the large variation in recruitment threshold observed in some earlier studies resulted not from wide variation in the recruitment ranking of motoneurons within one but rather from variation in the relative activity of different pools of our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that recruitment order is determined by some fixed property of alpha-motoneurons and/or by some unvarying combination of presynaptic inputs that fluctuate in
[effect of meteorological variations on the emergence of deep venous thrombosis of the recent articles have established a significant relationship between metereology variables and the development of vascular we performed a retrospective study to determine relationships between the development of deep vein thrombosis in the lower limb and certain meteorology materials and we identified 345 cases of phlebitis in we studied the distribution of the number of venous thrombosis per per month and per we compared certain meteorological data (atmospheric mean hygrometery) for days with and days without venous thrombosis and the atmospheric variations during the 48 hours prior to venous there was a significant relationship (p < between the mean number of cases of phlebitis recorded per day and season with winter on days when phlebitis the atmospheric pressure was significantly lower (p < the number of thrombotic events was significantly different on days when the variation was greater than 10 hectopascals than on days when the variation was less than 10 hectopascals (p < in our deep vein thrombosis of the lower limb was significantly associated with certain meteorology prospective multicentric studies are needed to confirm these

a glimpse into almost all known arthropod compound eyes exhibit regional variations of resolving absolute spectral and polarisation sensitivity which are likely to be matched to the probability of significant events and the availability of cues in the visual to understand the signal processing requirements that have led to the evolution of matched sensory and neural we thus need a detailed description of the input signals to a visual system and of the tasks to be performed under natural operating we report here on the first steps we took in an attempt to reconstruct an specific visual world with emphasis on the motion fiddler crabs (genus uca) live in burrows on sand- and mudflats and are active during low they carry their eyes on vertically oriented stalks and use vision to detect predators and conspecific signals generated by males waving one massively enlarged the crabs sit on the ground plane of a flat where significant events are most likely to occur in a narrow band around the we recorded scenes in a crab colony with a video camera at crab eye the salience of relevant features in the spectral and polarisation domains was analysed in digitised video images and short sequences of film were processed by a two-dimensional network of motion detectors at various spatial the output of the network provides us with histograms of the direction and strength of motion signals in various spatio-temporal frequency we discuss our results in terms of detection predictability of global vs local information content and higher level motion processing involved in intraspecific
venom variability among several tityus serrulatus individual differences in venom composition among several tityus serrulatus specimens collected in the same area were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay polyclonal antibodies raised against whole venom and against the alpha-type (toxin iv-5 or ts iv) and the beta-type toxin (toxin gamma or ts vii) were used to study specific variations in the the elisa results indicated clear differences among the scorpion venoms the lethality (ld50) determined by subcutaneous injections of pooled venom with the same characteristics showed an interesting correlation between the expression level of each component studied and the lethal effect of the among the groups the group with the highest concentration of alpha-type toxin showed the highest the groups with the lowest level of toxicity were those with a low concentration of alpha-type the results show that the lethality of the venom varies from specimen to specimen and suggest that alpha-type toxin must be the major lethal component in the whole
milk urea nitrogen as a tool to monitor the protein nutrition of dairy the relationship between protein nutrition and milk urea n was investigated in three experiments with a total of 125 after 4 wk of cows received 1 of 13 diets with different ratios of protein to energy for 16 milk was sampled individually for urea analyses during pretreatment and during wk and 15 of results were compared with n losses estimated from rumen fermentation and with n losses of metabolic the mean milk urea n concentration was mg/100 ml of milk to for bulk samples the rumen efflux of crude protein intake was the main determinant of the variation in milk urea n (r2 = residual sd = n losses from the rumen explained only about 50% of the variation in the milk urea n content of samples from individual the n losses of metabolic in these were responsible for 47 to 100% of urinary n were not related to milk urea results showed that regular measurement of milk urea n in bulk samples can be used to monitor n losses from rumen the value does not give an indication of the efficiency with which the absorbed protein is

cross-cultural patterns of growth and nutritional status of breast-fed growth patterns and iron status of infants who were breast-fed throughout their first year of life were examined in four 1) a group of high socioeconomic status in california (the darling 2) infants of normal birth weight (nbw) but from low-income families in 3) low-birth-weight full-term infants in and 4) infants in z scores were calculated by using both the current national center for health statistics reference data and a pooled data set based on breast-fed infants in six industrialized the nbw infants in honduras showed rapid growth in the first few months and were similar in weight-for-age to the darling infants until approximately 9 by the lbw infants remained far below the other cohorts throughout the first 12 despite an initial period of catch-up in the ghanaian weight-for-age faltered beginning at 3-4 but length-for-age did not falter until after 9 weight-for-length was highest in the nbw honduran infants and lowest in the ghanaian when z scores were adjusted for birth weight and maternal no significant faltering was evident in either weight or length in any of the cohorts during the first 12 when breast-feeding is continued during the first year of life and efforts are made to ensure adequate complementary feeding after 6 if growth faltering occurs it is probably attributable to prenatal factors and maternal population differences in iron status reflected variation in birth weight and in the use of iron-rich efforts to prevent child stunting and malnutrition must pay attention to prenatal as well as postnatal
measures of explained variation for a regression model used in survival this paper describes a measure of explained variation (mev) of survival times for a given regression model used in survival it quantifies the predictive power of a set of prognostic factors in the and therefore provides useful information for more precise prediction of patient and for designing randomized clinical trials with the capability of determining treatment the mev defined in this article is asymptotically derived from the squared product-moment it can be interpreted as an adaptation of the multiple correlation coefficient for the normal linear model to the survival time regression monte-carlo simulations are performed to investigate the statistical behavior of the proposed the mev is applied to estimate the predictive power of several sets of prognostic factors for gastric cancer in japan using data from a large clinical
nocturnal interactions between community elders and as measured by cross-correlation of their motor as the population families must assume increasing responsibility for the care of elderly disruptive nocturnal behaviors (dnbs) of such as complaining and demanding may result in interactions with caregivers that threaten such this study aimed to quantify such interactions by cross-correlating motor activity that was simultaneously recorded from the elders and forty-four elder-caregiver pairs reporting dnbs simultaneously kept sleep logs and wore activity recorders for 6 to 8 day and night activity data were analyzed because circadian variations would otherwise have overshadowed the elder-caregiver covariations of an autoregressive model was fitted to each day and night data and the data-model differences were used to calculate a cross-correlation maximum significant values of the cross-correlation functions (rmax) exceeded in 10 pairs of the unprocessed motor activity of these pairs looked so similar that rmax was interpreted as a measure of the the rmax was significantly larger for nighttime especially in pairs who shared the same it was smaller in pairs whose elders had high depression scores and in those with disease or related it was not affected by the presence of analysis of the lags corresponding to significant values of rmax showed in cohabiting it was mainly the elders who initiated the findings provide objective evidence that the night is a time of special difficulty for many caregivers of older
variation of electroencephalographic activity during non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep with phase of circadian melatonin rhythm in the circadian pacemaker regulates the structure and consolidation of human the extent to which this pacemaker affects electroencephalographic (eeg) activity during sleep remains to investigate a total of million power spectra were computed from eegs recorded in seven men 146 sleep 9 h 20 min each) who participated in a one-month-long protocol in which the sleep-wake cycle was desynchronized from the rhythm of plasma which is driven by the circadian in rapid eye movement (rem) sleep a small circadian variation in eeg activity was the nadir of the circadian rhythm of alpha activity hz) coincided with the end of the interval during which plasma melatonin values were close to the crest of the rem sleep in non-rem variation in eeg activity between and hz was primarily dependent on prior sleep time and only slightly affected by circadian such that the lowest values coincided with the phase of melatonin in the frequency range of sleep high-amplitude circadian rhythms with opposite phase positions relative to the melatonin rhythm were low-frequency sleep spindle activity hz) reached its crest and high-frequency sleep spindle activity hz) reached its nadir when sleep coincided with the phase of melatonin these data indicate that the circadian pacemaker induces changes in eeg activity during rem and non-rem the changes in non-rem sleep eeg spectra are dissimilar from the spectral changes induced by sleep deprivation and exhibit a close temporal association with the melatonin rhythm and the endogenous circadian phase of sleep
postprandial blood pressure changes in the postprandial blood pressure reductions have been observed in frail elderly this study evaluated blood pressure and heart rate changes in 10 healthy elderly subjects at intervals before and after a morning subjects did not exhibit significant reductions in systolic blood pressure or increases in heart rate over such changes were due to variation within they did not exhibit significant changes in diastolic blood and meal choice may have influenced further research will determine which groups of elderly are most at risk for postprandial blood pressure reductions and consequently at risk for injury from falls due to dizziness and

structural modification of fibroblast growth factor-binding heparan sulfate at a determinative stage of neural heparan sulfate (hs) glycosaminoglycans are essential modulators of fibroblast growth factor (fgf) activity and appear to act by coupling particular forms of fgf to appropriate fgf during neural one particular hs proteoglycan is able to rapidly switch its potentiating activity from as neural precursor cell proliferation to as neuronal differentiation using various analytical including chemical and enzymatic low pressure and strong anion-exchange high performance liquid we have analyzed the different hss expressed during these crucial developmental there are distinct alterations in patterns of total chain and the number of sulfated domains of the hs from the more mature embryonic these changes correlate with a switch in the ability of the hs to potentiate the actions of fgf-1 in triggering cell it thus appears that each hs pool is designed to function in the modulation of an intricate interaction with a specific growth factor and its cognate and suggests tightly regulated expression of bioactive disaccharide the data can be used to construct a simple model of controlled variations in hs chain structure which have functional consequences at a crucial stage of neuronal
sex ratio in relation to to investigate whether the sex ratio of children varies between fathers of different the sex ratio (the ratio of the number of boys to the number of girls at birth) was calculated in relation to paternal occupation in the cohort of all live births in north west from exact binomial confidence intervals were used to estimate whether the sex ratio in each occupational category was significantly different from that for the rest of the there were fewer occupational categories with significantly different sex ratios at the 5% level than expected by chance assuming the same binomial distribution of sexes at birth within each paternal significant variation of the sex ratio with occupations was not there is some evidence that the sex ratio shows less variance than expected under a binomial model which assumes independence of the sex of each a possible explanation of this may be parental preference for limiting family size after children of both sexes have been born or some other factor which results in children within a family being more likely to be of both sexes rather than the same
effect of social deprivation on disease severity and outcome in patients with rheumatoid social deprivation is now recognised to have an important impact on morbidity and this study sought to ascertain the effect of if on disease functional and outcome in rheumatoid patients in 814 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) were assessed for and laboratory indices of disease deprivation categories for individual patients were determined using the carstairs five year follow up is available for 440 the study population of ra patients live largely in the most deprived patients from deprived areas have significantly poorer function at outset and at five years as defined by the health assessment questionnaire (haq) this is not attributable to differences in disease duration in patients from the most deprived regions or compliance with these patients do not achieve over five years the initial functional level of those living in the most advantaged ra patients from deprived areas have poorer which is associated with greater and strategies and resources for healthcare need to be adjusted according to this
evolution of histone h4 and h3 genes in different ciliate the histones h4 are known as highly conserved in ciliates a high degree of variation was found compared both to other eukaryotes and between the ciliate to only h4 histones of species belonging to two distantly related classes have been in order to obtain more detailed information on histone h4 variation in ciliates we undertook a comprehensive sequence analysis of pcr-amplified internal h4 fragments from 12 species belonging to seven out of the nine currently recognized ciliate in we used pcr primers to amplify longer fragments of h3 and h4 genes including the intergenic the encoded amino acid sequences reveal a high number of differences when compared with those of other eukaryotes and the ciliate species in some species h4 gene variants were which result in amino acid the greatest number of substitutions and insertions found was in the amino terminal region of the h4 all sequences possess a conserved region corresponding to those of all other eukaryotic h4 the histone gene variations were used to reconstruct phylogenetic the tree from our data matches perfectly with the ribosomal rna the which were considered as a late branching diverge at the base of the ciliate tree and groups formerly thought to represent ancestral lineages now appear as highly derived

effect of different compression--decompression cycles on haemodynamics during acd-cpr in the haemodynamic effects of variations in the relative duration of the compression and active decompression (4 cm/2 cm) during active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation 50/50 and were tested in a randomized cross-over design during ventricular fibrillation in seven anaesthetized pigs (17-23 kg) using an automatic hydraulic chest compression-decompression duty cycles of 50/50 and 70/30 gave significantly higher values than 30/70 for mean carotid blood flow (32 and 36 21 ml transit time flow cerebral blood flow (30 and 34 radionuclide mean aortic pressure (35 and 41 29 mmhg) and mean right atrial pressure (24 and 33 16 a higher mean mean right atrial and mean left ventricular pressure for 70/30 were the only significant differences between 50/50 and there were no differences in myocardial blood flow (radionuclide microspheres) or coronary perfusion pressure aortic-right atrial pressure) between the three different duty cpp was positive in both the early and late compression period and during the whole decompression the expired co2 was significantly higher with 70/30 than 30/70 during the compression phase of beyond that no significant differences in the expired co2 levels were in conclusion a reduction of the compression period to 30% during acd-cpr reduced the cerebral the mean aortic and right atrial pressures with no effect on the myocardial blood flow of varying the compression-decompression
subgingival microbiota of shallow periodontal pockets in individuals after head and neck this study aimed at investigating the subgingival plaque microorganisms of shallow pockets (< or = 5 mm) in subjects who previously received irradiation in the head and neck region for treatment of nasopharyngeal direct microscopy and anaerobic culture were subgingival paper point samples were taken from 6 tooth-sites (one/sextant) per subject for direct microscopy (n = another set of paper points was taken from the deepest of the previously selected sites (one per subject) group a) no bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 9) and group b) bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 6) for microscopic and anaerobic culture under the the microflora was found to be a complex mixture comprising gram-positive and gram-negative rods and curved rods and low level of fungi were observed and mycelia were occasionally there was no significant variation in the plaque bacterial morphotypes observable according to sites of isolation and no significant difference between group a and group b in morphotypes of the different the predominant cultivable microflora comprised several species of facultative and obligate anaerobic porphyromonas and prevotella there was no difference between the two groups except the significantly higher proportion of kingella dentrificans isolated from group b colonization of the gingival sulcus in these individuals by microbes that are normal flora skin (peptostreptococcus prevotii and propionibacterium granulosum) and gut (eubacterium fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium) was these findings appear to suggest that the major components of the subgingival microflora of shallow sites in previously head- and neck-irradiated individuals are similar to that of gingivitis sites in the normal population although they may contain bacterial or fungal species uncommon in normal
the correlation between surface measurement of head and neck posture and the anatomic position of the upper cervical study repeated measurements were made of surface postural angles registering the relative positions of the head and neck in photographs and of angles of the upper cervical vertebrae recorded in lateral cephalometric radiographs in the same for all subjects assumed the natural head rest to examine the correlation between external measurement of head and neck posture and the anatomic positions of the upper four cervical summary of background interpretation of surface cervical posture measurement is confounded by lack of knowledge about the extent of the underlying compensatory adjustments among the upper cervical vertebrae that may accompany variation in head and neck the correlation between surface measurement and postural characteristics of the upper cervical spine has not been reported to the association between a set of angles describing the anatomic position of the four upper cervical vertebrae on lateral cephalometric radiographs and a surface measurement of head and neck the craniovertebral was studied in 34 young adult women aged between and mean anatomic positions of the upper four cervical vertebrae were expressed by angles relative to the true vertical or surface angles registering head and neck position for each subject were obtained from photographs recorded on two no strong correlation could be established between the angles taken from the lateral cephalometric radiographs measuring the extent of upper cervical orientation of the vertebral or odontoid process tilt and surface angles recording head and neck this finding was attributed principally to the much greater positional variability demonstrated within the upper cervical spine when compared with the surface measurements of head and neck anatomic alignment of the upper cervical vertebrae cannot be inferred from variation in surface measurement of head and neck this is the case even in those people identified with more extreme head and neck postural
variation in the diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infections and otitis media in an urgent medical care variation among hospitalized medical conditions have been reported but there is little information on variation among physicians for medical conditions that constitute a substantial part of ambulatory to measure variation in the diagnosis of 2 common medical otitis media (om) and upper respiratory tract infections (uris) in an urgent care estimate the variation in the incidence of new diagnoses of om and uris among 19 physicians working at 2 urgent care clinics between january and march patients are seen in order of and assignment to each physician is participants and two urgent care clinics staffed by the same 19 during the 3-month study patients were seen at the 2 of 1839 received a diagnosis of first time and 8020 of an main outcome incidence of new diagnoses of om and uri estimated as a proportion of all diagnoses for each individual there was substantial variation between physicians in the diagnosis of ranging from a low of to a high of there was less variation in the diagnosis of uri some physicians with a low incidence of om or uri diagnoses had increased the proportion of diagnoses in the other diagnostic for om the variation was greatest for children younger than age 5 but substantial variation was also found in for uris the variation was more uniform across all age the variation was not explained by type of specialty training or years in medical there is substantial variation between physicians in their diagnosis of om and uri in an urgent care this variation has implications for cost of diagnosing and treating these the training of and our understanding of the treatment of
herd size and sero-prevalence of salmonella enterica in danish swine a random-effects model for register the association between herd size and sero-prevalence of salmonella was assessed in a random-effects model with herd county and date of slaughter as fixed a total of meat-juice samples from herds located in 13 counties in denmark was included in the a random-effects model was developed from separate models for smaller strata of data from herds with approximately equal the combined model was analysed and the results herd size was positively associated with the sero-prevalence of salmonella but the size of the association was biologically of little because the within-herd and the between-herd variations were relatively large in the relative magnitudes of the variance components indicated that factors associated with both the herd level and the pig level could be important in the prediction of seroprevalence of
age and region-dependent contraction to alpha-adrenoceptor agonists in rat and guinea-pig isolated the influence of age and of region on alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated contraction to (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline was examined in rat (4-136 weeks) and guinea-pig (2-156 weeks) isolated tracheal ring preparations with particular emphasis on the early (up to 12 weeks) maturation in rat tracheal significant regional variation was observed with respect to maximal (-)-adrenaline-induced such that the greatest activity was seen in ring preparations from the laryngeal end of the tracheal rings from the carinal end responded very poorly or were unresponsive to depending on animal these regional differences were seen across the age the potencies of (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline remained unchanged with respect to animal but the maximum contractile tension that developed in response to these agonists increased with increasing animal age in all regions of the in guinea-pig isolated tracheal maximum contractile responses (emax) to (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline remained unchanged with increasing animal in there was no evidence for a region-dependence in the responsiveness of tracheal tissue to alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated contraction in this in both guinea-pig and rat isolated tracheal alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated contraction appeared to involve the activation of
environmental risk factors and female breast the increasing incidence of breast cancer in the united states and the international variation in risk have led to speculation that environmental risk factors are an important cause of breast we review the epidemiologic evidence on the breast cancer risk associated with ambient environmental exposures experienced passively by the us and discuss the difficulties associated with measurement of specific exposures in environmental we review geographic variation of breast cancer rates in the united and exposure to ionizing and electromagnetic and passive results are inconclusive but do not support a major role of environmental risk factors in the etiology of breast
influence of biological and analytical variation on urine measurements for monitoring exposure to to define the mean intraindividual biological variation in urinary concentrations of cadmium and retinol binding protein (rbp) in random urine samples and the influence of creatinine or specific gravity correction on reducing this the relation between biological variation and analytical variation in defining uncertainty in a single measurement and significant differences between successive measurements was repeat measurement study in subjects with either high historical exposure to cadmium but without current or unexposed standard statistical tools used in clinical laboratory medicine were applied to define intraindividual biological and analytical results and both creatinine and specific gravity correction of urinary cadmium measurements in random urine samples seem to reduce the intraindividual variability compared with uncorrected with a standard acceptable long term analytical precision for measurements of cadmium and rbp combined with creatinine analyses should be < 9% and < 15% the mean intraindividual biological variation of cadmium and expressed as creatinine was 18% and 40% respectively in the subjects exposed to with the analytical precision significant differences (p < between consecutive measurements for creatinine corrected urinary cadmium and rbp would need to show changes of > 54% and > 110% the relation between significant differences in consecutive results and differences in the analytical precision of the method used to measure the samples is
coevolution of immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain variable-region gene the gene families encoding the immunoglobulin variable regions of heavy (vh) and light (vl) chains in vertebrates are composed of many the gene number and the extent of diversity among vh and vl gene copies vary with to examine the causes of this variation and the evolutionary forces for these multigene we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of vh and vl genes from the species of the results of our analysis showed that for each vh and vl genes have the same pattern of clustering in the according to this clustering the species can be divided into two in the first group of species (humans and vh and vl genes were extensively intermingled with genes from other in the second group of species and the genes tended to form clusters within the same group of these results suggest that the vh and vl multigene families have evolved in the same they have undergone coordinated contraction and expansion of gene repertoires such that each group of organisms is characterized by a certain level of diversity of vh and vl the extent of diversity among copies of vh and vl genes in each species is related to the mechanism of generation of antibody in humans and dna rearrangement of immunoglobulin and joining-segment genes is a main source of antibody whereas in and somatic hypermutation and somatic gene conversion play important the evolutionary pattern of vh and vl multigene families is consistent with the birth-and-death model of yet different levels of diversifying selection seem to operate in the vh and vl genes of these two groups of
muscle spindles are concentrated in the superior vocalis subcompartment of the human thyroarytenoid it is hypothesized that different parts of the thyroarytenoid muscle (ta) are functionally the ta is divided into a lateral muscularis compartment and a medial vocalis this study examined the distribution of muscle spindles throughout the human ta as an indicator of these functional histological cross-sections from the and posterior regions of five human membranous vocal folds were examined for the number and location of muscle there was an average of muscle spindles in sections from each region with no significant variation between the different regions (p < in sections from all three the muscle spindles were always found to be concentrated in the superior medial quadrant of the ta (mean p < the inferior superior and inferior lateral quadrants of the ta contained and of the total muscle within the superior medial most of the muscle spindles were localized in the most superficial part of the the results of this study demonstrate that the majority of ta muscle spindles are concentrated in its superior medial an area we have termed the superior vocalis subcompartment this finding suggests that the superior vocalis sc is functionally distinct from the remainder of the it is hypothesized that tension in the superior vocalis sc can be controlled independently from the remainder of the and this capability is used to effect the biomechanics of vocal fold vibration during
transforming growth factor beta1 in the human cyclic increased expression by estradiol and and regulation of plasminogen activators and plasminogen activator the purpose of this study was to identify cyclic variations and hormonal regulation of endometrial transforming growth factor beta1 (tgfbeta1) regulation of the plasminogen-activating system was also since it is involved in activation of latent we measured tgfbeta1 mrna in 51 normal endometrial samples by northern blot and densitometric scanning of each value was related to the corresponding beta-actin value to allow quantitative tgfbeta1 mrna was higher in the mid and late secretory and menstrual phases than in the earlier parts of the this pattern implies progesterone the content of tgfbeta1 mrna in endometrial tissue explants obtained in the proliferative phase was significantly increased after stimulation for 4 days with estradiol + progesterone in both tgfbeta1 and estradiol + progesterone increased the content of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 mrna and protein in primary cultures of endometrial stromal conditioned-medium concentrations of urokinase plasminogen activator (u-pa) were increased by but decreased by estradiol + this effect of estradiol + progesterone results from increased internalization and degradation of u-pa secondary to up-regulation of the cell surface receptor for u-pa by progesterone (casslen et jcem increased extracellular u-pa in response to tgfbeta1 exposure was thus in concordance with an unchanged amount of available u-pa receptors on the cell the activation mechanism of latent tgfbeta involves u-pa since u-pa activity is reduced in the secretory we suggest that although tgfbeta1 mrna is increased in the mid and late secretory tgfbetas are mainly in their latent form until the premenstrual rise in u-pa activity stimulates tgfbeta may promote capillary growth during endometrial
anatomical congruence of metabolic and electromagnetic activation signals during a self-paced motor a combined pet-meg we have investigated the degree of spatial correlation between the cerebral blood flow variations measured by positron emission tomography (pet) and the electromagnetic sources as measured by magnetoencephalography (meg) in five subjects while performing a self-paced right index finger tapping data were processed independently for each technique using both single-case and intersubject pet and meg were coregistered with anatomical magnetic resonance images for each both extension and flexion motor-related fields were extracted from the meg using the single dipole model we identified the motor evoked field 1 (mef1) in all subjects and the motor field (mf) in three individual and intersubject averaged pet data showed consistent contralateral primary sensorimotor (psm) hand area and bilateral supplementary motor area meg individual and intersubject averaged results demonstrated that both mef1 and mf dipoles were localized within the psm pet activated individual psm mass center to dipole distance was 12 and mm on average for the mef1 and the mf for the same the intersubject averaged analysis shows distances between the pet z-score maximum and the dipole locations of and these results show that pet and meg mef1 activation signals spatially coincide within and modeling

a quality assurance network in central european countries--radiotherapy a survey of the infrastructure in radiotherapy centres in three central european countries has been performed as a first step in the development of a quality assurance data concerning radiotherapy staff and number of patients treated in most of the radiotherapy centres from czech poland and hungary were collected at the beginning of equipment data have shown that 35% of 182 treatment units are conventional x-ray 35% 60co 19% linear 7% 137cs units and 4% about 47% of high energy units are older than 12 years and about 20% older than 21 an important number of centres still have no simulator which would constitute an important handicap to carry out adequate the number of treatment planning systems has also been 44% being pc-based systems with locally developed large variations are observed in the number of patients treated per per high energy but 12/47 centres treat more than 700 patients per year and on the staffing seems adequate in numbers though there are wide the main limitation of radiotherapy infrastructure in the central european countries is the low number of linear accelerators and simulators and the advanced age of therapy
clinical performance of glass-ionomers were introduced to the profession 20 years ago and have been shown to be a very useful adjunct to restorative their major advantages include the ion exchange adhesion to both enamel and dentine and a continuing fluoride release throughout the life of the the chemistry of the setting reaction is essentially an acid/base reaction but recent research has introduced variations in an effort to improve clinical small additions of resin increase the physical properties to a degree and allow for a light-initiated setting it is essential that the acid/base reaction remains dominant if the full advantages of the glass-ionomer are to be the material has multiple uses in dentistry and it shows a high degree of biocompatibility to the pulp and surrounding soft the main limitation at this time is a relatively low fracture resistance but it is possible to protect it through lamination with stronger materials if the need this paper examines the essential parameters for successful clinical placement and comments on its
sexual selection related to developmental stability in drosophila relationships among developmental sexual and body size were examined in the cactophilic fly drosophila developmental as measured in terms of fluctuating asymmetry (fa) of wing was positively associated to copulatory success in a mass-mating experiment with wild-reared previous studies showed that body size is positively correlated with mating success and other fitness components in this but no phenotypic correlation between wing asymmetry and size was found in the present wing asymmetry does not indicate male quality in terms of phenotypic variation in body this study suggests that sexual selection against wing asymmetry may be mediated through unknown factors related to developmental stability rather than body
follicle stimulating hormone international standards and reference preparations for the calibration of immunoassays and follicle stimulating hormone is a dimeric glycoprotein hormone which is used widely in reproductive and developmental medicine both as a diagnostic analyte and as a therapeutic it is therefore a good example of a clinically important heterogeneous material for which a number of different assay methodologies have been immunoassays for follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) are used in the diagnosis of disorders of reproduction and whereas in vivo bioassays are used for calibration of therapeutic different immunoassay based on different exhibit variability in their estimates of activity of fsh which arises from different specificities of antibodies for different forms of fsh which are in order to minimise between assay variation and to enable better between laboratory comparisons the world health organisation (who) has issued a series of ampouled preparations of the availability of these materials has been reviewed previously but on the completion of a recent collaborative study to evaluate candidate standards for rdna-derived fsh and highly purified urinary fsh (urofollitropin) it is now appropriate to review the current status of these standards and to discuss the future of standardisation for fsh in particular and where appropriate to make reference to other
the collaborative hospital transfusion variations in use of autologous blood account for hospital differences in red cell use during primary hip and knee red cell use in patients undergoing diagnosis related group (drg) 209 procedures (major joint and limb reconstruction procedures of the lower extremities) has been shown to have unexplained interhospital study design and abstracted records of 2590 consecutive drg 209 patients at five university hospitals from january 1992 to december 1993 were stratified by procedure and preoperative blood deposit patient characteristics and transfusion and in-hospital outcomes were compared across blood use among patients who did not preoperatively deposit blood was similar across significant differences were found across hospitals for total hip replacement patients in the percentage of patients preoperatively depositing blood percentage of patients receiving transfusion(s) (51 to > the mean number of units collected per patient and the mean number of unused autologous units per 100 patients no significant differences were found in the percentage of those who deposited blood and then required allogeneic there was little variability in length of hospital stay or in last findings were similar for total knee replacement interhospital variations in red cell use for primary total hip and knee reconstruction are primarily due to hospital-specific differences in autologous blood collection and
short-term evidence for chaotic series of mini growth spurts in rat five thousand and eighteen quadruplet daily measurements of lower-leg length of 62 female and 81 male were performed in order to characterize short-term within a short growth proceeds irregularly and consists of multiple incremental bursts (mini growth spurts) with no evidence for strict periodic mini growth spurts are s-shaped incremental patterns that can be characterized by double-exponential functions functions are and can be defined by three parameters that identify inflection point (age at peak growth and the latter not only refers to the rapidity of each incremental but also alludes to the duration that one incremental burst needs for in regard to these mini growth spurts differ significantly between the sexes in mean amplitude of mini growth spurts was 2153 microm (sd 1034 microm) in female rats and 2958 microm (sd 1614 microm) in male peak growth velocity of mini growth spurts appeared lower in male rats than in female female rats showed mean gamma of (sd whereas male rats showed mean y of (sd partial growth hormone deficiency led to a modification in rats that was reversed when exogenous growth hormone was mean intervals between subsequent mini growth spurts ranged between and but the large variation of these intervals (sd between and days) and the fact that neither spurt-spurt interval nor spurt amplitude appeared strongly suggest chaotic behavior of mini growth
dna sequence diversity in a region of the human lipoprotein lipase gene [see lipoprotein lipase plays a central role in lipid metabolism and the gene that encodes this enzyme (lpl) is a candidate susceptibility gene for cardiovascular here we report the complete sequence of a fraction of the lpl gene for 71 individuals (142 chromosomes) from three populations that may have different histories affecting the organization of the sequence eighty-eight sites in this kb vary among individuals from these three of 79 were single nucleotide substitutions and 9 sites involved insertion-deletion the average nucleotide diversity across the region was (or on average 1 variable site every 500 at 34 of these the variation was found in only one of the reflecting the differing population and mutational if lpl is a typical human the pattern of sequence variation that exists in introns as well as even for the small number of samples considered will present challenges for the identification of or combinations of that influence variation in risk of disease in the population at
involvement of isk-associated k+ channel in heart rate control of repolarization in a murine engineered model of jervell and lange-nielsen the jervell and lange-nielsen (jln) syndrome affects the human cardioauditory associating a profound bilateral deafness with an abnormally long qt interval on the it results from mutations in kvlqt1 and isk genes that encode the 2 subunits forming the k+ channel responsible for the cardiac and inner ear slowly activating component of the delayed rectifier k+ current a jln mouse model that presents typical inner ear defects has been created by knocking out the isk gene this study specifically reports on the cardiac phenotype determined in the whole animal and at mrnas and cellular surface ecg recordings of isk-/- mice showed a longer qt interval at slow heart a paradoxical shorter qt interval at fast heart and an overall exacerbated qt-heart rate adaptation compared with wild-type (wt) a 300-ms increase in the heart rate cycle length induces a 309+/-21% increase in the qt duration of the wt mice versus a 500+/-50% in isk-/- mice it is concluded that the isk gene product and/or when blunts the qt adaptation to heart rate variations and that steeper qt-rr relationships reflect a greater susceptibility to arrhythmias in patients lacking
topographical relationship of the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves in the subarachnoid space and internal auditory our purpose was to investigate the topographical relationship of the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves from the brain stem through the internal auditory we dissected 15 formalin-fixed cadaveric heads and performed mr examinations in 35 healthy subjects in order to examine the topographical relationship of the facial and vestibulocochlear the cadaveric dissections and the in vivo mr imaging findings were compared the relationship between the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves showed some variation among individuals and according to the location of the nerves within the cisterns or near the brain 53% of the vestibulocochlear nerves were partially segmented on mr the vestibulocochlear nerve was completely divided into separate nerves only in the most lateral portion of the except in three cadaveric in which separation of the superior vestibular nerve was seen near the brain the facial and cochlear nerves were of similar size on 36% of the mr the superior vestibular nerve was larger than the inferior vestibular nerve on 81% of the mr the appearance of the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves was variable but followed certain consistent
analysis of the pres1 gene of hepatitis b virus (hbv) to define epidemiologically linked and un-linked infections in south analysis of the pres1 gene of hepatitis b virus was used to define two nosocomial outbreaks of hbv in an outbreak in an oncology unit we had previously shown by single stranded conformational polymorphism (sscp) analysis of a 189 bp fragment of the pres1 that 52 children were infected with hbv strains that displayed only 5 different sscp sequencing of a 383 bp fragment encompassing the entire pres1 revealed that isolates with same sscp profile were identical in sequence across the entire pres1 confirming that those patients with the same sscp pattern had epidemiologically linked a second outbreak involved 8 liver transplant patients from two different 5 of whom were from the same hospital at which the oncology outbreak had two of these 5 patients had hbv strains that were identical to strains from the oncology unit and nosocomial transmission probably accounted for the infections in these while diversity of both sscp profiles and sequence data of remaining 6 patients supported the conclusion that they had not been infected from a common the donor liver is believed to be the most likely source of infection in these hbv isolates from patients infected in the community were used as a standard for the general degree of pres1 sequence variation of local hbv phylogenetic analysis and comparison with reference hbv clones revealed that of 27 local hbv genotypes a and d occurred most frequently and were identified in 14 and 12 patients while genotype c was detected in one
the effect of selective sweeps on the variance of the allele distribution of a linked multiallele hitchhiking of microsatellite variation and the mechanisms which are responsible for this variation have received much attention in the last few most theoretical studies of microsatellite allele did not incorporate the evolutionary dynamics of linked the dynamics is usually modeled by invoking a special mutation mechanism such as stepwise which leads to a stepwise increase or decrease of the number of motif repeats on the occasion of it is shown here that selection at a which itself is not subject to but which is adjacent to a microsatellite locus has an influence on statistics of the microsatellite allele provided that mutation rates are low to when compared to the inverse of the time to fixation of a linked favorable if mutation rates are as for example in a selective effect upon the microsatellite such as will quickly be obscured by in in the latter the model shows that no correlation is to be expected between recombination rates and variability of microsatellites--such as had been predicted and experimentally demonstrated for nucleotide variability and recombination rates in the present model is a generalization of the two locus two allele hitchhiking model which had been studied by stephan and
a polymorphic microsatellite locus conserved across eutherian mammal a dinucleotide microsatellite was found to be conserved at the untranslated end of the neural cell adhesion molecule (ncam) gene in rat and the high level of sequence conservation found in this gene allows the use of a single set of pcr primers to amplify sequence spanning the repeat in many sequence analysis revealed the conservation of the dinucleotide repeat in all eutherian mammal species studied with variation in length as well as internal structure caused by base polymorphisms were seen across five mammalian in whale and with polymorphisms predicted in pig and dugong based on the length of the uninterrupted dinucleotide
the kinetics of tracer movement through homologous gap junctions in the rabbit observation of the spread of biotinylated or fluorescent tracers following injection into a single cell has become one of the most common methods of demonstrating the presence of gap many of the fundamental features of tracer movement through gap junctions are still poorly these include the relative roles of diffusion and iontophoretic and under what conditions the size of the stained mosaic will or the effect of variations in amount of tracer as produced by variation in electrode resistance following cell is not to examine these neurobiotin was microinjected into the two types of horizontal cell of the rabbit retina and visualized with images were digitally captured using a confocal the spatial distribution of neurobiotin across the patches of coupled cells was adequate fits to the data were obtained by fitting to a model with terms for diffusion and amount of tracer results indicated that passive diffusion is the major source of tracer movement through gap whereas iontophoretic current played no role over the range fluorescent although slightly less sensitive than peroxidase produced staining intensities with a more useful dynamic the rate constants for movement of neurobiotin between a-type horizontal cells was about ten times greater than that for b-type horizontal although direct extrapolation to ion conductances cannot be tracer movement can be used to give an estimate of relative coupling rates across cell retinal or modulation conditions in intact

minimax optimization-based inverse treatment planning for interstitial thermal the following work represents the development and evaluation of a minimax optimization-based inverse treatment planning approach for interstitial thermal therapy of cancer and benign the goal is to determine a priori optimal applicator placements and power level settings to maintain the minimum tumour and maximum normal tissue tmax within a prescribed therapeutic temperature the temperature distribution is approximated by a finite element method (fem) solution of a bioheat transfer equation on a nonuniform finite element lower and upper therapeutic temperature thresholds are specified in the tumour and surrounding normal a constrained minimax optimization problem is formulated to determine optimal applicator positions and power level settings that minimize the maximum (rather than average) temperature errors in the target tumour region and surrounding normal the optimization problem is formulated for two general classes of interstitial heating those with and without a surface cooling the viability and sensitivity of this approach is investigated in the two-dimensional setting for various tumour shapes and blood perfusion levels using surface-cooled and direct-coupled interstitial ultrasound applicator power deposition these preliminary results indicate the utility of this approach for meeting a prescribed tmin/tmax-based clinical objective and its potential for generating optimal treatment plans that can withstand variations or uncertainty in blood perfusion
the illness that made us any hypotheses concerning the origins of humans must explain many among these the growth in brain size around two million years the presence of subcutaneous the near absence of change or cultural progress for around 2 million years after the brain grew in the cultural explosion which began somewhere between fifty thousand and one hundred thousand years ago with the emergence of religion and the further cultural explosion around ten thousand to fifteen thousand years ago which developed with the emergence of agriculture and which has continued since the like subcutaneous is particularly rich in and since the microconnections of the brain are substantially lipid in it is suggested that changes in lipid metabolism are what differentiated humans from the great the growth in brain size and in the quality of subcutaneous adipose tissue may have occurred because of changes in the proteins which regulate the rate of delivery of fatty acids to notably lipoprotein lipases and fatty acid binding the creativity which occurred one hundred thousand years ago may have resulted from changes in -remodelling and -degrading enzymes which largely determine the microconnectivity of family studies and adoption studies indicate that schizophrenia in a family member is associated with an increased risk of the illness in other family it is also associated with an increased risk of sociopathy and on the other hand it is also an indication of an increased likelihood of high leadership achievements in many high musical skills and an intense interest in i propose that the characteristics which entered the human race about one hundred thousand years ago and which ended around two million years of cultural near-stagnation are precisely those shown by the families of people with i propose that these features are caused by variations in phospholipid biochemistry which are responsible both for schizophrenia and for our this would help to explain why schizophrenia is present to approximately the same degree in all it is the illness which made us human prior to the separation of the
artificial cells with emphasis on bioencapsulation in the most common use of artificial cells is for bioencapsulation of biologically active each artificial cell can contain combinations of the composition and shape of an artificial cell membrane can be varied using different types of synthetic or biological these possible variations in contents and membranes allow for large variations in the properties and functions of artificial artificial cells containing adsorbents have been a routine form of treatment in hemoperfusion for this includes acute high blood aluminum and and supplement to dialysis in kidney artificial red blood cell substitutes based on modified hemoglobin are already in phase i and phase ii clinical trials in artificial cell encapsulated cell cultures are being studied for the treatment of liver gene therapy and other research on artificial cells containing enzymes includes their use for treatment in hereditary enzyme deficiency diseases and other recent demonstration of extensive enterorecirculation of amino acids in the intestine has allowed oral administration to deplete specific amino one example is an inborn error or metabolism resulting in high systemic phenylalanine preliminary clinical studies in patients using bioencapsulation of cells or enzymes have artificial cells containing complex enzyme systems convert wastes like urea and ammonia into essential amino artificial cells are being used for the production of monoclonal interferon and other biotechnological other areas of biotechnological uses include drug and other areas of chemical engineering and
usefulness of rapid gc analysis of cellular fatty acids for distinguishing weissella weissella weissella hellenica and some arginine-negative weissella strains of meat in an attempt to differentiate between weissella hellenica and some atypical arginine-negative weissella isolates from their cellular fatty acid composition was determined by a rapid gc results showed that viridescens synthesized eicosenoic while the other two species did unlike hellenica lacked cyclopropane fatty acids with 19 carbon dihydrosterculic or lactobacillic weissella viridescens contained zero to low amounts (< 1%) of c19 original meat isolates identified as viridescens or hellenica shared similar fatty acid profiles with the respective type whereas the atypical weissella isolates resembled more with and all together with leuconostoc mesenteroides interesting variations were noted in the total c19 cycl contents among unidentified being generally consistent with their grouping based on the type of lactate they formed and the whole-cell protein profile similarity they
measurement of lumbar spine flexion-extension using a low-field open-magnet magnetic resonance rationale and the authors investigated the feasibility of using a low-field open-magnet magnetic resonance (mr) scanner to acquire functional flexion-extension images for range of motion (rom) measurements on the lumbar seventeen healthy subjects with no symptoms of back pain (age 22-59 years) were scanned in a low-field open-magnet mr scanner in the and extended each image was downloaded to a computer workstation for subsequent and rom data from two subjects were not analyzed because their images did not show all the lumbar for the remaining there was a large variation in the magnitude of the rom values 9 degrees-70 mean sd there was a significant correlation between age and rom (r = p < the low-field open-magnet mr scanner provides a method for noninvasive imaging of the lumbar allowing the subject freedom of movement in the horizontal this enables functional flexion-extension images of the lumbar spine to be
patients as partners in clinical a proposal for applying quality improvement methods to patient the authors show the potential value of using statistical process control (spc) methods to measure change in health status for patients with chronic examples will be used to compare the strengths and weaknesses of these methods to randomized clinical trials run control and regression models are used to explain variations in hypertension and significant improvements are shown in the examples given using the western electric these spc methods can be used for self-management of chronic they provide a new set of tools for measuring health care
detection of known and new mutations in the thiopurine s-methyltransferase gene by single-strand conformation polymorphism to detect mutations in the thiopurine s-methyltransferase gene we have developed a strategy based on single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of the gene amplified by polymerase chain reaction the sensitivity of the method was first evaluated by analyzing dna samples from five including two high methylators two intermediate methylators and one deficient methylator tpmt alleles and mutations in each of these individuals had previously been characterized by conventional pcr-based assays and direct sequencing all mutations were associated with particular shifts in the electrophoretic mobility of dna allowing their we further tested the efficiency of the strategy to detect new tpmt for this additional dnas from 15 ims and 15 hms were submitted to pcr-sscp a total of 7 alleles were including two new the first termed harbors a single mutation c-->t at nucleotide -178 in exon 1 and was detected in a hm the second termed was characterized by a t-->g transversion at nucleotide 681 in exon this allele should be a nonfunctional allele of the tpmt gene since it was observed in combination with a wild-type allele in an intermediate we conclude that the pcr-sscp strategy we developed could be advantageously used to fully characterize the extent of allelic variation at the tpmt gene locus in populations and thus to improve our understanding of the genetic polymorphism of tpmt which has considerable consequences for the toxicity and efficacy of therapeutically important and widely used
influence of ph on metabolism and urease activity of helicobacter background & the metabolic and urease responses of helicobacter pylori to variations in gastric acidity are the aim of this study was to determine effects of changes of environmental ph on urease and survival of pylori in an unbuffered bacterial metabolism and urease activity were determined by measuring ph changes in perfused microphysiometer chambers over a ph range from to with or without urea and survival by restoration of metabolism at ph glucose metabolism by acid-adapted pylori occurred at a perfusion ph between and and was highest between and metabolism was irreversibly inhibited at ph or in the presence of mmol/l the chamber ph increased to about during perfusion between ph and at ph and urease activity increased several-fold without change of chamber urea in the perfusate enabled retention of metabolism after acid exposure but was toxic at ph the metabolic range of acid-adapted pylori is between an environmental ph of and extracellular ph-regulated internal urease activity allows metabolism in the ph range between and 5 by maintaining periplasmic ph at the organism is an acid-tolerant neutralophile due to internal urease
isolation of bacillus cereus in the feces of healthy adults in taipei fecal specimens from 100 healthy adults were collected and examined for the presence of bacillus cereus which has been associated with 28% of the outbreaks of food poisoning on taiwan within the last 3 total isolate rate from these specimens was variations in isolation rates were found not only in but also in different presence of cereus in the feces of healthy adults may be unpredictable and relate to foods consumed or to other an isolation rate of cereus as high as 30% during the outbreak investigation is still not a strong evidence to implicate this organism as an etiological
