reliability and validity of the japanese version of the zarit caregiver burden despite a rapid increase in disabled elderly in the burden of the caregiver has not been properly assessed due to a lack of objective our study was aimed at adapting and validating the zarit caregiver burden interview (zbi) in which is one of the most widely used measurements for burden in the united sixty-six caregivers answered the self-administered involving the japanese version of the zbi and questions regarding their caregiving our study demonstrated that the japanese version of the zbi had equally as high reliability and validity as the original the japanese zbi had a high test-retest reliability (r = and internal consistency alpha = the total score of the zbi was highly correlated with the score of the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale (ces-d) score (r = as well as a single global rating of burden (r = it was also shown that demographic distribution of the score of the japanese version had a similar trend to that of the original caregivers who looked after patients with behavioral disturbances were found to have a significantly higher zbi score than those who looked after patients without behavioral which is consistent with previous it is concluded that the japanese version of the zbi can be used to measure feelings of burden of caregivers in the japanese population and can be used for cross-cultural
molecular cloning and characterization of decay-accelerating factor deficiency in cromer blood group inab an additional decay-accelerating factor (daf) designated as inab phenotype in the cromer blood group was recently identified in a 28-year-old japanese woman the red blood cells of like those of other inab phenotype were negative for cromer system and the deficiency of daf on the red blood cells of has been shown by immunoblotting with a murine monoclonal antibody to molecular analysis has shown that is homozygous for a single nucleotide at the position 24 bp upstream of the of exon 2 of the daf this substitution causes the activation of a novel cryptic splice site and results in the production of mrna with a 26 bp the deletion introduces a reading frame shift and creates a stop codon immediately downstream of the translation of mrna would be terminated at the first amino acid residue of the second short consensus repeat (scr2) domain (exon 3) of the functional domains of complement regulatory activity and the carboxy-terminal signal domains for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi) anchoring are predicted to be lacking in there would be no daf present on the cell
plasmacytoma of the gastrointestinal tract in higher incidence than in japan and epstein-barr virus as a result of a systematic review of lymphoma of the gastrointestinal tract (gi) at the yonsei korea and the osaka we found an extramedullary plasmacytoma in 5 of a total of 78 cases in korea and 1 of 136 cases in which represents an approximately 9-fold difference in the presence of the epstein-barr virus (ebv) genome was examined in paraffin-embedded specimens from the 5 cases with gi plasmacytoma from korea together with 17 patients collected by a nationwide study in there were no clinical findings suggestive of the presence of immunodeficiency in these korean and japanese there were no prominent differences in the age distribution or sex ratio between the patients of the two the proliferation of mature plasma cells was almost monomorphous with occasional bi- or multinucleated the immunohistochemistry revealed a restricted cytoplasmic expression of immunoglobulin light kappa type in 8 cases and lambda type in a polymerase chain reaction of preserved dna from 4 korean and 16 japanese patients found that only both were positive for ebv of subtype the difference in the frequency of ebv positivity between korean and japanese cases was significant (p < in situ hybridization revealed positive signals in the nucleus of the tumor ihc revealed that the tumor cells in these two cases were positive for latent membrane protein-1 and eb nuclear showing latent infection of these findings suggest a close association of ebv and korean gi and might partly explain the remarkable number of cases in this
differences in the diagnostic criteria used by japanese and western pathologists to diagnose colorectal in view of the many studies of early stage colorectal carcinoma from it is essential to know whether the criteria for the histologic diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma are similar in japan and western eight expert pathologists from japan north america and europe (2) individually reviewed microscope slides of 20 colorectal lesions from japanese patients who had undergone endoscopic mucosal resection or surgery because early stage carcinoma and/or adenoma was the pathologists indicated the pathologic findings on which they based each for 11 slides that showed adenoma according to the western pathologists with low grade dysplasia according to at least half of the japanese diagnosed definite carcinoma with or without adenoma in 4 cases and adenoma in and in 2 cases they were equally divided between a diagnosis of adenoma and for five slides showing adenoma with high grade dysplasia according to the western the japanese diagnosed definite carcinoma with adenoma in three cases and adenoma in and in one case they were equally divided between a diagnosis of adenoma and for one case in which the western pathologists were equally divided between a diagnosis of carcinoma and adenoma with high grade all the japanese pathologists diagnosed definite carcinoma with or without three slides showed definite carcinoma with or without according to both the western and the japanese the presence of invasion was the most important diagnostic criterion of colorectal carcinoma for the western whereas for the japanese the nuclear features and glandular structures were more in colorectal carcinoma is diagnosed on the basis of nuclear and structural even in cases considered by western pathologists to be noninvasive lesions with low grade this diagnostic practice may contribute to the relatively high incidence of early stage colorectal carcinoma reported in japan as compared with western
novel point mutation in the leucine-rich motif of the platelet glycoprotein ix associated with bernard-soulier bernard-soulier syndrome (bss) is a rare inherited bleeding disorder which is caused by a qualitative or quantitative abnormality of the platelet glycoprotein (gp) ib/ix/v we examined a patient with bss to find a molecular basis for the defect underlying this the propositus was a 39-year-old japanese female with life-long bleeding sequence analysis of the gpix gene revealed a t-->c point mutation at nucleotide 1856 resulting in phe55(ttt)-->ser(tct) this substitution created a new mnli restriction site in the mutant restriction analysis revealed that the propositus was homozygous for this and the same mutation was not detected in 57 unrelated japanese since this mutation is located in the leucine-rich motif (lrm) of the gpix the phe55-->ser substitution may result in an alteration of the lrm which leads to the impaired surface expression of gpib/ix/v a characteristic of

mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene in japanese patients with apert apert syndrome is a clinically distinctive condition characterized by mid-face and severe symmetrical syndactyly of the hands and mutations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (fgfr2) gene have been associated with several craniosynostosis conditions including and pfeiffer mutations detected in and pfeiffer syndromes are located at several sites in the fgfr2 the mutational spectrum in apert syndrome is remarkably mutations detected thus far in caucasian patients with this syndrome are exclusively transversions from cytosine to guanine at either nucleotide position 934 (c934g) or 937 (c937g) in the fgfr2 to examine the possibility that the narrow mutational spectrum in apert syndrome was a result of racial or environmental we studied three apert syndrome patients from two unrelated japanese families for c934g and c937g the c934g mutation was found in all three this is the first demonstration of fgfr2 gene mutations in japanese our evidence that the c934g mutation identified in caucasian patients also occurs among japanese patients excludes the possibility of racial or environmental predilection for this nucleotide position 934 is a mutational hotspot of the fgfr2 gene in japanese patients as although the mechanism by which the mutation occurs remains to be whether c937g is a mutational hotspot in japanese patients as well remains to be
the interaction of preserved pragmatics and impaired syntax in japanese and english aphasic elicited narrative studies have shown that the underlying pragmatic factor of empathy is relatively preserved in aphasic speakers of japanese and english (7 japanese and 14 english-speaking aphasics of varied diagnostic occasional can be explained in terms of a conflict between the normal encoding of the empathic characteristics of an event and the syntactic limitations imposed by impaired production to account for these we propose a production model following levelt (1989) for making pragmatic choices among syntactic we also suggest that preferential access to might be a matter of surface rather than involving semantics or more abstracts levels of

high proportion of missense mutations of the brca1 and brca2 genes in japanese breast cancer mutations in either of two recently identified brca1 and are thought to be responsible for approximately two-thirds of all cases of autosomal-dominantly inherited breast to examine the nature and frequency of brca1 and brca2 mutations in japanese families exhibiting a high incidence of breast we screened 78 unrelated families in this category for mutations of these two examining the entire coding sequences as well as exon-intron boundaries of both genes by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) and multiplex-sscp we identified possible disease-causing alterations in brca1 among affected members of 15 families and in brca2 in another 14 in 15 of those 29 the affected individuals carried missense although most germline mutations reported worldwide have been deletions or nonsense our indicating that missense mutations of brca1 and brca2 tend to predominate over frameshifts or nonsense mutations in japanese breast cancer will contribute significantly to an understanding of mammary tumorigenesis in and will be of vital importance for future genetic
a case of primary lymphoma of the uterine cervix treated by combination chemotherapy we present a case of primary lymphoma of the uterine ann arbor stage this 64-year-old multiparous japanese woman showed markedly elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) and of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sil-2r) at the time of combination chemotherapy was administered and consisted of vincristine and prednisolone after 3 courses of such the serum levels of ldh and of sil-2r decreased within normal and the patient achieved a complete
association of hla class i and class ii alleles with myositis in japanese to investigate the correlation of hla class i and class ii antigens and alleles with various forms of myositis in japanese eighty-four japanese patients with myositis [22 with polymyositis 46 with dermatomyositis 16 with myositis overlapping with other collagen vascular diseases] were typed serologically for c and dqb1 alleles were determined by polymerase chain reaction dependent dna typing fifty-eight japanese controls were typed serologically while and dqb1 allele typing was carried out in and 104 hla-b7 was higher in patients than controls vs in odds ratio the increase of hla-b7 was largely dependent on the increase in overlap patients hla-a24 and b52 were significantly decreased in pm as compared to while cw3 was significantly increased in pm versus drb1*08 alleles were significantly increased in patients vs in especially in pm and dqa1*0501 and dqb1*0301 were significantly decreased in patients vs in and vs in hla-class i and class ii alleles associated with japanese patients with myositis may be different from those associated with caucasian
association of asthma and the interleukin-4 promoter gene in susceptibility to the development of asthma and other atopic diseases is known to be associated with genetic several investigator have linked the interleukin-4 (il-4) gene and nearby markers located on chromosome 5 to atopy and recent study has demonstrated that the t allele of a polymorphism in the il-4 gene promoter region (c-590t) is associated with elevated levels of total serum the objective of this study was to evaluate the possible role of this il-4 polymorphism (c-590t) in modulating the allergic response and asthma in japanese methods and the study was conducted in two different families ascertained through asthmatic children (asthmatic 306 members) in whom linkage of asthma and atopy to chromosome 5q31-33 is suggested and a random general population (control 215 the il-4 c-590t polymorphism was genotyped by pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism frequency of the t allele was in the asthmatic group and in the control no significant difference in the levels of total serum ige and specific ige to house dust mite was observed between subjects with homozygote for the c a heterozygote and a homozygote for the t allele by intrafamilial and interfamilial using the transmission disequilibrium we found a significantly frequent transmission of the t allele to asthmatic children our data suggest that the il-4 promoter c-590t polymorphism may be associated with the development of asthma in japanese but not through modulating total serum ige
mitral valve aneurysm as a sequela of infective review of pathologic findings in japanese mitral valve aneurysm is defined as a localized protrusion of the valve with a different radius from that of the remaining portion of the the medical records and pathological findings of seven patients with mitral valve aneurysm [aged 48-69 years (mean 4 males] and the pathological findings of other 29 japanese cases were all seven patients were diagnosed pathologically as infective but two patients had no documentation of clinical symptoms suggestive of infective endocarditis (latent infective the underlying lesion of the heart was aortic valve disease and/or fibrosal degeneration of the mitral only 29 of 36 japanese case reports stated a precise description of the valve of these 29 23 were associated with infective two with rheumatic valvular disease with fusion and/or shrinkage of the chordae three with mitral valve prolapse or myxomatous degeneration of the mitral and one with aortitis neovascularization was described in eight neovascularization with thick wall should be considered as post-inflammatory this review indicates that patients with latent infective endocarditis and mitral valve aneurysm should be considered as potential candidates for valve
micro and macro perspectives in findings and considerations upon the variability of short term and individual growth and the stability of population derived the present paper links the two most contrasting aspects of and addresses the apparent discrepancy between the variability and pulsatility of short term individual and the stability of population derived when body stature is measured at monthly an irregular incremental pattern becomes with a number of large scale components such as series of prepubertal and pubertal growth seasonal influences on height and influences of the psychosocial and economic when measurement intervals the patterns of stature increment appear even more and a number of short scale components become that are distinct from measurement observations are presented that suggest growth being a a a respectively a chaotic event as suggested by some recent studies in animals and in human accurate measurements of the lower leg at intervals of 24 hours support the idea of short term growth being characterized by chaotic series of growth that occur at intervals of approximately 4-9 the amplitude of mini growth spurts ranges between 2 and some 10 and also growth velocity of each spurt varies considerably so that one spurt needs between less than one and up to several days for the very opposite of the variability of individual growth was found in a meta-analysis of 40 male and 51 female european and us american growth studies revealed an almost uniform general pattern of average stature increment during the last 100 an additional analysis of stature variation of very large japanese and czechoslovakian growth with all together more than 23000000 and more than 500000 german preschool and school suggested similar uniformity in the standard deviation of
production of emotional facial expressions in european and chinese european and chinese 11-month-olds participated in emotion-inducing laboratory facial responses were scored with an anatomically based coding chinese infants were less expressive than european american and japanese on measures of smiling and chinese infants scored lower than european american whereas japanese infants were similar to the european american infants or fell between the two other results suggest that differences in expressivity between european american and chinese infants are more robust than those between european american and japanese infants and that chinese and japanese infants can differ cross-cultural differences were also found for some specific and midface facial actions brows these are discussed in terms of current controversies about infant affective facial
analysis of peripherin/rds gene for japanese retinal we studied 133 japanese patients with retinal dystrophies to detect peripherin/rds (retinal degeneration slow) gene the patients analyzed included 52 with autosomal dominant retinitis 36 with autosomal recessive retinitis 3 with simplex retinitis 12 with cone-rod 5 with rod-cone 3 with vitelliform macular dystrophy 4 with macular 2 with cone 2 with fundus 2 with fundus and 12 with retinitis pigmentosa with macular degeneration as well as 40 unrelated normal three exons of the peripherin/rds gene cut into 150-200 base-pair fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and screened by single-strand conformation the dna fragments with any suspected variations were directly eight point mutations were among two missense mutations at codons 304 and 338 result in an amino acid substitution of glutamine for glutamic acid and aspartic acid for they were not cosegregated with the and these mutations were also commonly found in normal for these the proportion of transversion from g to c at codon 304 (gag-->cag) and transition from g to a at codon 338 (ggc-->gac) were +/- and +/- our results suggest that a peripherin/rds gene mutation might be rare in japanese
liver transferase activity in healthy japanese employees aged 18-39 the aims of the present study were to identify correlates of alanine aminotransferase (alt or gpt) and aspartate aminotransferase (ast or got) activities among a healthy working population aged and to discuss liver transferase subjects included employees of a company in pregnant employees exposed to organic and employees with a history of liver diseases were serum alt and ast levels were measured by an enzymatic other information including job type and lifestyles was mean alt and ast levels were significantly higher for males than females (p < multiple linear regression analysis revealed that sex and bmi explained 45% and 31% of the variability in alt and the prevalence of abnormal alt levels (> 40 iu) was for males and for and shift work were independently associated with abnormal alt levels by logistic regression it is concluded that alt and ast levels are well-correlated with sex and and that abnormal liver transferase activity is prevalent in male employees but rare in suggesting that liver function tests should be introduced for male employees under 40 years of
echocardiographic evaluation of cardiac valvular abnormalities in adults with it is well known that congenital heart abnormalities are common in children with however there are few studies on cardiac abnormalities in adults with we estimated cardiac abnormalities by means of echocardiography in 30 institutionalized japanese adults with but without cardiac two-dimensional echocardiography showed an incidence of in mitral valve prolapse and 20% increase of echo brightness in the mitral doppler echocardiography revealed an incidence of in mitral valve and in aortic valve even adults with syndrome who are apparently free of cardiac symptoms may be at risk for valvular
microsatellite polymorphism within the micb gene among japanese patients with disease (bd) is known to be associated with in order to investigate the influence of the micb located about 120 kb centromeric of the hla-b on the susceptibility to (ca/tg) dinucleotide repeat microsatellite polymorphism in intron 1 of the micb gene was investigated among 77 japanese patients with 60 randomly selected controls and 28 hla-b51-positive unrelated healthy there was no significant difference in the phenotype frequency of the microsatellite polymorphism between the bd patients and this result suggests that the micb gene itself is not responsible for the development of and that the candidate gene(s) for bd is located between the mica and hla-c
intracystic papillary carcinoma of the breast in case report and review of the japanese we report a case of intracystic papillary carcinoma of the breast in a 62-year-old japanese who came to our hospital complaining of a right subareolar imaging diagnosis was a cyst with an intracystic since repeated aspiration biopsy cytology was interpreted as a borderline no additional treatment had been because he wanted the removal of the mass 14 months after his first an excisional biopsy was performed under local pathological examination revealed the intracystic component to be non-invasive papillary although the incidence of male breast cancer is approximately 1% of all breast intracystic papillary carcinoma in the male is very from a review of the literature on this disease in japanese an intracystic component can often be demonstrated by it is difficult to confirm malignant cells by aspiration biopsy cytology of cyst since some cases have a local excisional biopsy and long-term follow-up are
