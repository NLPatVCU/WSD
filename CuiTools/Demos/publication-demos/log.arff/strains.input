[levels of thermostable direct hemolysin production by vibrio parahaemolyticus strains carrying both tdh and trh one hundred and twenty-five strains of vibrio parahaemolyticus carrying both the tdh and trh genes were selected from the strains isolated from the travelers with diarrhea by an hybridization test using polynucleotide the levels of tdh produced by these strains and the association between the tdh levels and related characteristics in these strains were the tdh level varied greatly from strain to but none of the levels was as high as that of the typical kanagawa phenomenon-positive the strains were classified into (18 tdh (85 and tdh (22 strains) based on the results of a modified elek test and the hemolysis assay on wagatsuma the highest tdh level achieved by the was twofold lower than that of the kanagawa phenomenon-positive strains as assayed by the rpla all strains possessed the toxr the trh1 and trh2 genes were detected 105 and 20 and no correlation existed between the type of the trh gene and the levels of tdh considerable restriction fragment length polymorphism was observed with the tdh gene-bearing hindiii dna fragment in different but it was not related with the tdh
increasing antimicrobial resistance in clinical isolates of streptococcus the presence of antibiotic-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae has become a major clinical problem in several parts of the there is a lack of data from southeast we therefore initiated a study to determine the serogroups/serotypes and antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical strains of pneumoniae isolated in our in we isolated 144 strains of thirty-six strains were resistant to penicillin of which 19 were highly resistant (minimal inhibitory concentration > thirty-eight strains were resistant to 75 were resistant to 48 were resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and 29 were resistant to twenty of the penicillin-resistant strains also had diminished susceptibility to strains resistant to penicillin belonged to serogroups/serotypes 6 (n = 9 (n = 23 (n = 14 (n = 6) and 19 (n = children under 5 years of age were more likely than older children and adults to have isolates resistant to penicillin versus p = penicillin-resistant strains were more likely than penicillin-susceptible strains to be multidrug-resistant versus p < we concluded that there is a high prevalence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci in our isolates especially among very young most penicillin-resistant strains belong to serogroup 19 and are also resistant to multiple
genomic dna fingerprinting of clinical isolates of helicobacter pylori by rep-pcr and restriction fragment genetic diversity of 32 helicobacter pylori strains isolated from patients with gastric or duodenal or lymphoma was determined by repetitive sequence element polymerase chain reaction and by the new typing method restriction fragment end-labelling these two methods were used to investigate a possible correlation between clinical symptoms and the genetic background of helicobacter both rep-pcr and rfel revealed 31 different patterns for the 32 strains but the pair of isolates with identical rep-pcr patterns was not the same as the pair of isolates with identical rfel computer-assisted analysis of the dna fingerprints was used to determine similarity this analysis revealed no clustering of disease-specific strains by any of the two
isolation of influenza a(h3n2) virus with phase we report the isolation of two influenza a(h3n2) virus strains which were in the first passages in mdck cell to agglutinate chicken though reacting with guinea pig and turkey red blood this observation demonstrates that the occurrence of this phenomenon is not exclusive to influenza a(h1n1) as previously in order to investigate the molecular basis of this we analysed the nucleotide sequence of the ha-1 presumed to be involved in the switch of haemagglutination from the virus present in the original samples and in the corresponding strains isolated and cultivated in mdck cells and in embryonated the substitution of amino acid 138 (ala-->ser) in mdck cells could be related to the change in haemagglutination
clonal distribution of the three alleles of the gal(alpha1-4)gal-specific adhesin gene papg among escherichia coli strains from patients with the three alleles of the gal(alpha1-4)gal-specific adhesin gene of escherichia coli p were detected in 101 (54%) of 187 coli bacteremia isolates from long and by a polymerase chain reaction-based and their distribution was compared with clonal structure and other bacterial and host allele ii predominated overall (57% of papg+ 32% for iii and 2% for allele distribution differed significantly between alleles segregated according to enzyme electrophoretic lineage and o serogroup in patterns suggesting both vertical and horizontal transmission and emergence within coli in the temporal sequence strains containing allele iii preferentially agglutinated sheep whereas strains containing allele ii preferentially agglutinated human allele iii was associated with multiple copies of the pap and cluster iii of the phylogenetic these findings indicate that among bacteremia isolates of the three papg alleles exhibit distinctive associations with evolutionary hemagglutination and non-pap virulence
gene organization and sequence determination of the two botulinum neurotoxin gene clusters in clostridium botulinum type a(b) strain nctc the gene organization and nucleotide sequence of the type a and b bont-gene clusters in clostridium botulinum strain nctc 2916 were the aim was to clarify the organization of genes within botulinum type a strains possessing an unexpressed bont/b the bont/a-gene cluster includes genes encoding ntnh and a part of p-47 (the gene for this protein was reported in strains of botulinum types e and clustered with the silent bont/b gene were genes encoding p-21 and sequencing analysis of the ntnhs revealed the presence of 471 amino acids identical in the type b and a gene this gene organization contrasts markedly with the purported organization in strain nctc 2916 described by henderson et (fems in type a(b) strain nctc the neurotoxin gene is of type bont/a1 within a gene cluster that has identical organization to that found in bont/a2 type these observations may be significant in establishing the origin of the bont-gene
comparative in-vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against enterococcus the in-vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against enterococcus was compared with that of telcoplanin and the susceptibility of 106 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus 92 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium and 14 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) was only one strain of vancomycin-susceptible faecium was not susceptible to < or = mg/l this strain required 4 all strains of faecalis were inhibited by < or = 8 mg/l quinupristin/dalfopristin and all vre strains were inhibited by < or = 2 in teicoplanin and vancomycin showed inhibitory activity against faecalis and faecium but not against amoxycillin was active against faecalis but not usually against faecium and showed variable activity against 38% of 84% of faecium and 80% of vre strains were resistant to the bactericidal activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against faecium exceeded that of the comparator drugs as judged by ratios and killing the mbc99 of quinupristin/dalfopristin determined by a microdilution broth technique was < or = 1 mg/l for four of the five strains of vancomycin-susceptible faecium and three of the five vre strains tested with time-kill curves showed a > or = 2 log reduction in viable count after exposure to quinupristin/dalfopristin for 6
cell proliferation enhances entry of listeria monocytogenes into intestinal epithelial cells by two proliferation-dependent entry bacterial entry into intestinal host cells is the result of a fairly sophisticated manipulation of host cell machinery by the to study further the potential cell target of listeria the in-vitro entry of monocytogenes strains into intestinal cells was examined in relation to the proliferation and differentiation of the cells by the alamarblue [3h] thymidine and brush border-associated enzyme the study showed that cell metabolism was not involved in the entry of monocytogenes in three cell models (two human and one on the other entry was closely related to the proliferation process and poorly related to the differentiation state of the the use of monocytogenes mutants lacking invasion proteins showed that inla and inlb acted in synergy to mediate the entry of monocytogenes into proliferative whereas inla alone seemed to be involved in the entry into non-proliferative these two entry pathways could correspond to the two cellular processes used by monocytogenes to enter proliferative and non-proliferative as suggested by the use of cytochalasin chloroquine and taken we propose a hypothesis in which the entry of monocytogenes is mediated by interaction between randomly distributed e-cadherin on the surface of proliferative in the entry into non-proliferative cells may involve a proto-oncogenic tyrosine kinase signal that modifies e-cadherin in these results suggest that monocytogenes may preferentially enter crypt cells in vivo by a microfilament-dependent whereas the few bacteria that infect villus cells enter by an e-cadherin-internalin interaction that mediates microtubule-dependent
characterization of helicobacter pylori interactions with sialylglycoconjugates using a resonant mirror a new optical biosensor technique based on the resonant mirror was used to characterize helicobacter pylori strains according to their sialic acid demonstrating the suitability of using intact bacteria in real-time measurements and classifying strains based on their binding results obtained from both competition and displacement assays using different glycoconjugates confirmed that but not strains express sialic acid-binding specific for the removable from the bacterial surface by water is not related to other reported cell surface proteins with binding ability to sialylated compounds such as

isolation of campylobacter jejuni from a pollution event which occurred at a spring in the arnside area of cumbria provided an opportunity to investigate whether campylobacter jejuni could be detected in hydrological evidence suggested that the source of contamination was a dairy farm situated within the hydrological catchment of the polluted the microbiological quality of the polluted spring was monitored during intervals over the following 12 months and compared with others in the campylobacter jejuni was isolated by filter enrichment of 500 ml and 100 ml filtered volumes of it was not isolated in the absence of faecal indicator some strains of jejuni from water had identical biotypes to strains isolated from the dairy this paper reports the first isolation of jejuni from groundwater using cultural methods and supports the theory that groundwater may be a vehicle for campylobacter
vibrio pectenicida a pathogen of scallop (pecten maximus) five strains were isolated from moribund scallop (pecten maximus) larvae over 5 years (1990-1995) during outbreaks of disease in a hatchery their pathogenic activity on scallop larvae was previously demonstrated by experimental the phenotypic and genotypic features of the strains were the g + c content of the strains was in the range 39-41 dna-dna hybridization showed a minimum of 73% intragroup phylogenetic analysis of small-subunit rrna sequences confirmed that these strains should be affiliated within the family vibrionaceae and that they are closely related to vibrio tapetis and vibrio phenotypic and genotypic analyses revealed that the isolates were distinct from these two vibrios and so constitute a new species in the genus they utilized only a limited number of organic substrates as sole carbon including betaine and but did not utilize glucose and in their responses were negative for decarboxylase and dihydrolase the name vibrio pectenicida is proposed for the new strain a365 is the type strain (= cip
bactericidal effect of levofloxacin on strains with equal susceptibility in an in vitro urinary bladder the in vitro bactericidal effects of therapeutic concentrations of levofloxacin (lvfx) on clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis were starting from 10(7) the bacterial count was determined serially during the exposure to lvfx present at concentrations automatically simulated to its clinically achievable urinary levels at the recommended dosage (100 mg 3 times an isolate of aeruginosa for which the mic of lvfx was 16 microgram/ml was completely eradicated after 10 h of exposure to on the other 40 h of exposure to lvfx were required for complete eradication of an isolate of faecalis with equal although the bacterial count was rapidly reduced to 10(2) cfu/ml in the early phase of the it was concluded that lvfx exerts a more potent bactericidal effect on aeruginosa than on faecalis despite a similar susceptibility of these organisms to
a rapid method for determination of susceptibility of mycobacterium tuberculosis to using acridinium-ester-labeled dna a rapid isoniazid (inh) susceptibility test was developed for mycobacterium tuberculosis by using acridinium-ester (ae)-labeled dna the method was applied to two reference strains and 20 clinical then compared with the standard proportion by comparing the difference of log relative light units (rlus) tuberculosis cultures incubating in the presence and absence of inh susceptibility could be determined with the ae-dna probe after three to five days of the difference of log rlus of susceptible strains was statistically significantly lower than that for resistant strains after incubation for three to five the cutoff value was defined as + one standard of the difference between log rlu(inh) and log rlu(no inh) on day by this agreement between the ae-dna probe and the proportion concentration method was found in 19 of 20 susceptibility tests the ae-dna probe test is rapid and and may provide a useful alternative method for inh susceptibility testing for clinical isolates of
[assessment of a new four-hour diagnostic kit--rapid one system for the identification of enteric rapid one system is a newly developed four-hour rapid diagnostic kit for the identification of enteric to know the effectiveness of this we used 125 strains of gram-negative bacilli for this except for acinetobacter all the bacilli belong to family the bacterial strains of this assessment belong to 12 genera and 20 among 84 strains were freshly isolated from clinical specimens and 41 strains were frozen (-70 degrees c) stock clinical the results show that 115 strains were correctly identifed to the species it yielded and of correct identification of fresh isolates and frozen in this the reading criteria of rapid one system would also be
