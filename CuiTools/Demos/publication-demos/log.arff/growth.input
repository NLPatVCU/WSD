effect of growth rate and body mass on resting metabolic rate in galliform in this we asked whether within-species variation in chick resting metabolic rate was related to variation in growth and whether this relationship changed during development in three galliform species meleagris guinea numida and japanese coturnix coturnix resting metabolic rate increased by a bi- or triphasic pattern with body for each the relationship between metabolic rate and growth was studied by residual with two measures of growth rate and body chick mass reflects the net result of accumulated while hatchling mass reflects embryonic in high metabolic rates coincided with low growth rates in turkeys and guinea these species delay initial food and under these circumstances high metabolic expenditure may preclude conversion of yolk energy into body no relationship was present between residual hatching metabolic rate and residual body in older residual metabolic rate was positively linearly related with residual growth rate (turkeys and young quail) or residual body mass (guinea fowl and older the similarity of the slopes suggests that growth rate and accumulated growth affected maintenance metabolism to the same extent throughout these findings suggest that growth models must take ontogenetic adjustments of metabolic rate into account in addition to costs of
effect of arginine on toxin production by clostridium difficile in defined twenty strains of clostridium difficile were examined for the effect of arginine on toxin production in a defined in three the production of toxins a and b was greatly enhanced in the absence of these strains showed distinctively poorer growth in the absence of arginine in comparison with the remaining 17 indicating that the presence of arginine is required for good growth among the three from the present test strains were divided into two a group in which arginine insufficiency caused distinctly poor growth and enhanced toxin and another group in which there was neither distinctly poor growth nor enhanced toxin the phenomenon is discussed in relation to the biosynthesis and catabolism of
the induction of immune responses to murine malignant mesothelioma by il-2 gene stable il-2 transfectant clones have been derived from two non-immunogenic murine malignant mesothelioma (mm) cell lines to investigate the induction of protective antitumor immunity to ac29-il-2 transfectant clones grew at a slower rate in vivo than the parental cell line or a transfectant control clone but all inoculated mice developed tumours despite the continued ability of the tumour cells to express tumour development after inoculation of ab1-il-2 transfectants the degree of in vivo inhibition (40-100%) being directly related to the rate of il-2 secretion of the when mice which had rejected the ab1-il-2 transfectants were challenged with parental ab1 a proportion (16-70%) of mice from each group remained tumour free at least 45 days after challenge (naive mice developed tumours within 26 the inhibition of growth of the initial inoculum of ab1-il-2 transfectants was independent of cd4+ and cd8+ consistent with the demonstration of non-specific cytotoxic activity by splenocytes from mice inoculated with the il-2 these data suggest that il-2 expression by mm cells is capable of generating in vivo immunity to the this immunity may be relatively weak or may be subject to down-regulation so that consistent rejection of unmodified tumour cells is not genetic modification with combinations of including il-2 and will be necessary for reliable generation of protective immunity to
effects of the neurotrophins nerve growth and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) on neurite growth from adult sensory neurons in compartmented we used compartmented cultures to study the regulation of adult sensory neurite growth by we examined the effects of the neurotrophins nerve growth factor neurotrophin-3 and bdnf on distal neurite elongation from adult rat dorsal root ganglion (drg) neurons were plated in the center compartments of three-chambered dishes in the absence of and neurite extension into the distal (side) compartments containing or nt3 was initial proximal neurite growth did not require any of the while subsequent elongation into distal compartments required after neurites had extended into ngf-containing distal removal of ngf by treatment with anti-ngf resulted in the cessation of growth with minimal neurite in contrast to the effects of no distal neurite elongation was observed into compartments with bdnf or to examine possible additive neurite extension into compartments containing bdnf plus ngf or nt3 plus ngf was there was no increased neurite extension into ngf plus nt3 while the combination of bdnf plus ngf resulted in an inhibition of neurite extension compared with ngf we then investigated whether the regrowth of neurites that had originally grown into ngf subsequent to in vitro axotomy still required the results demonstrated that unlike adult sensory nerve regeneration in the in vitro regrowth did require and neither bdnf nor nt3 was able to substitute for since the initial growth from neurons after dissociation (which is also a regenerative response) did not require it would appear that neuritic growth and regrowth of adult drg neurons in vitro includes both ngf-independent and ngf-dependent the compartmented culture system provides a unique model to further study aspects of this differential regulation of neurite
increased expression of midkine during the progression of human midkine a member of a new family of neurotrophic and angiogenic growth factors whose expression is developmentally is produced in fetal malignant one of the most neovascularized are derived from there has been no investigation of the expression of mk in human astrocytic to determine if increased levels of mk expression correlate with the progression of human we examined surgical specimens of astrocytic tumors of various grades using northern and western mk mrna and protein expression levels were higher in high-grade astrocytomas (anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas) than in low-grade as shown by in situ mk mrna expression was intense in a majority of glioblastoma cells but was weak in a small number of low-grade astrocytoma these findings suggest that mk expression correlates with the malignant progression of the aberrant mk expression in high-grade astrocytomas may underlie their rapid growth and well-vascularized
a novel heregulin isoform that is an autocrine growth factor for the human breast cancer cell a novel neuregulin termed was cloned and characterized from the human breast cancer cell as observed with other is a product of alternative mrna splicing of the neuregulin gamma-hrg contains the egf-like and immunoglobulin-like domains that are commonly found in other family but lacks a transmembrane and cytoplasmic the new isoform possesses a unique n-terminal region that includes a hydrophobic domain that may function as a secretion a purified recombinant version of gamma-hrg competes for binding to soluble erbb3- and erbb4-igg fusion proteins with affinities similar to those observed for gamma-hrg has a wide distribution in mesenchymal or neuronal tissues but in contrast to other it is not present in liver and small expression of gamma-hrg with its cognate erbb3 and erbb2 suggested that the growth of the mda-mb-175 cell line might be a result of the autocrine stimulation of a growth factor signaling treatment of mda-mb-175 cells with an anti-erbb2 monoclonal antibody that interferes with the ligand-dependent formation of erbb2-erbb3 heterodimer complexes shows a strong growth inhibitory effect on this cell incubation with a receptor-igg fusion protein that neutralizes secreted also inhibits cell these data suggest that the secretion of gamma-hrg by mda-mb-175 cells leads to the formation of a constitutively active receptor complex and stimulates the growth of these cells in an autocrine

a saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant defective in the kinesin-like protein kar3 is sensitive to several mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae showing poor growth in the presence of elevated concentrations of nacl were isolated to identify genes involved in the osmo-stress one of these mutants osr11) which showed a clear segregation of the salt-stress phenotype upon tetrad analysis when crossed to a wild-type strain has been the mutation responsible for poor growth under salt-stress was the corresponding gene was cloned by complementation of the mutant phenotype and a fragment was the sequence of this fragment matched that of a gene previously identified to be involved in karyogamy and allelism of osr11 to kar3 was confirmed by tetrad and disruption mutants showed the same nacl-phenotype as the original osr11 the disruption mutant was more sensitive to high sucrose concentrations than the original mutant was to high glucose in a different genetic background the kar3 disruptants were less sensitive to osmo-stress than the nitrogen-starvation and cultivation on ethanol failed to affect the growth of osr11 and kar3 pointing to a possible specific involvement of kar3 in the osmotic-stress microscopic studies showed that cell division of the kar3 mutants was impaired and nacl-stress conditions aggravated the
evaluation of urine composition and calcium salt crystallization properties in standardized volume-adjusted 12-h night urine from normal subjects and calcium oxalate stone the volume of 12-h night urine from ten normal men ten normal women (nw) and 31 male calcium stone formers (sfm) was adjusted to 750 ml and analysed with respect to supersaturation with calcium oxalate (caox) and calcium phosphate inhibition of caox crystal growth and as well as the caox and cap crystallization concentrations of oxalate and glycosaminoglycans and ap(caox) an estimate of the caox ion-activity were higher and the concentration of citrate lower in nm than in in sfm the directly assessed risk of caox crystallization was higher and the inhibition of caox crystal growth lower than in there were no differences between the groups regarding inhibition of caox crystal growth by 74% dialysed urine or inhibition of caox crystal sfm with mixed caoxcap stones had a higher concentration of phosphate and a higher ap(cap) index at ph than sfm with caox
effects of high glucose on vascular endothelial growth factor expression in vascular smooth muscle vascular endothelial growth factor in addition oto its growth-promoting effects on endothelial can also increase vascular permeability and monocyte it has therefore been implicated in the pathogenic neovascularization associated with diabetic retinopathy and the factors regulating vegf expression in the vascular wall are not fully in this we examined the regulation of vegf expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmc) by hyperglycemia as well as by angiotensin ii (ang we also examined whether the 12-lipoxygenase (12-lo) product 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-hete) can alter vegf since 12-lo products of arachidonic acid have angiogenic and ang ii as well as high glucose 25 mm) can increase 12-lo activity and expression in studies were carried out in human (hsmc) or porcine vsmc which were cultured for at least two passages under normal glucose mm) or hg hg culture alone increased the expression of vegf mrna and protein in both hsmc and ang ii treatment significantly induced vegf mrna and protein expression only in vsmc cultured in hg and not in 12-hete significantly increased vegf mrna and protein expression in hsmc cultured in ng as well as in cells cultured in hg also secreted significantly greater amounts of vegf into the culture these results suggest that elevated vegf production under hg conditions may play a role in the accelerated vascular disease observed in
physiological changes in extracellular sodium directly control human proximal tubule growth and in order to examine the nature and potential mechanisms of action of extracellular sodium on human proximal tubule growth and quiescent primary cultures of human proximal tubule cells (ptc) were incubated for 24 h in growth-factor-free culture media containing low (130 control (140 mmol/l) or high (150 mmol/l) compared to control cells exposed to a high na+ concentration demonstrated stimulated thymidine incorporation +/- p < and increased cellular protein content +/- p < the latter arising from suppressed protein degradation ([3h]valine release +/- p < and unchanged protein synthesis ([3h]valine incorporation +/- p > substitution of choline chloride for nacl did not replicate these cells incubated in low-na+ media showed reduced thymidine incorporation +/- p < reduced protein synthesis +/- p < reduced protein degradation +/- p < and an unaltered protein content +/- a role for apical na+/h+ exchange (nhe) activity in mediating na+-dependent alterations in ptc growth was suggested by the findings of increased ethylisopropylamiloride- (eipa)-sensitive 22na+ uptake in the presence of a high na+ concentration (159 +/- 19% of p < 05) and concentration-dependent inhibition of cellular growth by eipa at levels corresponding to those producing inhibition of apical conditioned media from low control or high na+ ptc contained comparable amounts of platelet-derived growth factor-ab 19 +/- +/- and +/- ng/mg p > and transforming growth factor-beta1 +/- +/- and +/- ng/mg p > and did not exhibit autocrine growth factor activity on separate ptc following adjustment of na+ concentrations to 140 mmol/l by control or high-na+ media did not modify the mitogenic responsiveness of ptc to insulin-like growth factor-i (igf-i) or alter the affinity or number of ptc igf-i binding the results confirm that physiological increases in extracellular na+ concentration directly stimulate human proximal tubule growth and na+ such stimulation does not appear to be mediated by altered ptc secretion or responsiveness cytokines known to affect tubule growth and
role of lipoproteins in the delivery of lipids to axons during axonal nerve fiber elongation involves the input of lipids to the growing since cell bodies are often a great distance from the regenerating alternative sources of lipids have been we previously demonstrated that axonal synthesis of phosphatidylcholine is required for axonal growth (posse de and (1995) cell posse de and (1995) in cholesterol is not made in we now show that when compartmented cultures of rat sympathetic neurons are incubated with in the absence of exogenously supplied cholesterol synthesis is inhibited and axonal growth is the addition of cholesterol to the axons or cell bodies of neurons treated with this inhibitor restores normal axonal a supply of cholesterol via lipoproteins restores normal axonal in lipoproteins do not provide axons with sufficient phosphatidylcholine for normal elongation when axonal phosphatidylcholine synthesis is our studies support the idea that during axonal regeneration lipoproteins can be taken up by axons from the microenvironment and supply sufficient but not for we also show that neither apoe nor apoa-i within the lipoproteins is essential for axonal
characterization of the phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase gene from candida phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (prpp) synthetase catalyzes the transfer of phosphate from atp to d-ribose-5-phosphate during the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides and tryptophan and histidine biosynthesis in a variety of we cloned and sequenced the prpp synthetase gene (prs1) of candida albicans in saccharomyces a deficiency in prpp synthetase activity interacts with a mutation in elm4-1 (elongated morphology) to cause constitutive pseudohyphal growth in nitrogen-rich in order to study the role of the albicans prs1 in growth and we used gene disruption to isolate prs1 while heterozygous prs1 clones were readily null strains were not recovered indicating that prs1 is probably essential for growth of the heterozygotes in prs1 produced approximately 35% less prpp synthetase (p = and exhibited a similar reduction in transcript confirmation of a single disruption in prs1 was obtained by i-scei digestion of chromosomal-sized dna and southern blot while no role in morphogenesis is elucidated by this the data strongly suggests that prs1 is an essential gene in albicans and supports earlier results that indicated the presence of a single prs gene in
two intracellular signaling pathways for activation of protein kinase c are involved in oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced macrophage recent studies demonstrated that oxidized ldl (ox-ldl) induces macrophage growth in the present study was undertaken to elucidate the intracellular signaling pathways for macrophage ox-ldl initiated a rapid and transient rise in intracellular free calcium ion and induced activation of membrane protein kinase c pertussis toxin completely inhibited the ox-ldl-induced rise in free calcium ion and significantly inhibited macrophage growth by pkc inhibitors calphostin c and h-7 significantly inhibited ox-ldl-induced macrophage growth by on the other phospholipase a2-treated acetylated ldl did not induce a rise in calcium but significantly activated pkc and led to significant macrophage growth that was significantly inhibited by calphostin c by these results suggest the presence of two intracellular signaling pathways for activation of a rise in calcium that was mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive g protein and the internalization of lysophosphatidylcholine through the scavenger these two pathways may play an important role in ox-ldl-induced macrophage
guinea pig auditory nerve response triggered by a high density electrode the electrically evoked potential in the auditory nerve is measured when the cochlear is stimulated with a high density electrode array whose microcontacts (20 x 160 microns) are placed close to the nerve threshold range from 8 to 35 microa with the stimulating electrodes near the spiral ganglion a multi-pole technique for restricting the spread of current with electrical stimulation of the cochlea is tested using neural recording in deafened guinea the ground based quadrupolar electrode driving configuration has thresholds for neural activation only slightly greater than monopolar stimulation when the electrode contacts are placed less than 50 microns from the during simultaneous stimulation the monopole and the ground based quadrupolar modes tend to generate similar growth functions (magnitude and the electrode interactions are generally which means that the algebraic sum of the responses (magnitude growth functions) produced by 2 distinct electrodes is less than when the same 2 electrodes are stimulated
radiation sensitivity of human hair follicles in scid-hu we developed an experimental model for studying the growth and epilation of the human hair follicle by implanting human scalp tissue onto immunodeficient scid/scid the skin grafts showed continuous growth of black human hairs for at least 1 year and maintained the normal histological structure of a human hair follicle and other tissues associated with the using this in vivo we evaluated the effect of irradiation on the function of human hair localized x irradiation (1 to 6 gy) induced hair loss dose-dependently and synchronously in the third week after the hairs undergoing epilation showed a gradual decrease in width toward the the minimum width at the thinnest portion of the surviving hair 4 weeks after irradiation suggested that epilation resulted from the breaking of hairs when the hair width decreased to less than 20 after the highest-dose the normal structure of the hair bulb was totally and long and narrow epithelial tissues associated with regressed papillary cells the surviving epithelia were morphologically similar to the outer epithelial sheath of the follicle associated with palisadic basal cell in the third week some cells in the basal layers of the surviving epithelium in each follicle expressed proliferating cell nuclear by about 9 weeks after the complete structure of the follicle with hair growth activity even in the grafts irradiated at the highest although about 30% of the hairs did not these findings suggest that follicular stem cells that survive high-dose exposure in the sheath-like epithelial tissue can reproduce the complete follicle this animal model can be used to assess the effects of radiation exposure on human skin and to identify and characterize human follicular stem
the cxc receptor 2 is overexpressed in psoriatic the cxc chemokines interleukin-8 and gro/melanoma growth-stimulatory activity (gro-alpha) are potent activators of neutrophils and but also stimulate growth and differentiation of nonhematopoietic cells like and high mrna and protein levels have been detected in psoriatic chemokine activation of target cells is mediated by specific receptors and two cxc receptors have been described with similar affinity for interleukin-8 but different affinities for in this we examined the expression of both cxcr1 and cxcr2 in psoriatic identifying the target cells of chemokine activation in by immunohistochemistry and in situ as confirmed by northern blot analysis and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain we could detect expression of the cxcr2 in suprabasal lesional psoriatic keratinocytes but not in healthy the cxcr1 could not be localized in psoriatic keratinocytes with immunohistochemistry and in situ but infiltrating cells in the dermal compartment expressed both types of these data suggest that in addition to neutrophil activation by both cxcr1 and activation of keratinocytes mediated by cxcr2 could contribute to the characteristic epidermal changes observed in
regulation of rar beta expression by rar- and rxr-selective retinoids in human lung cancer cell effect on growth inhibition and apoptosis retinoids regulate the growth and differentiation of human tracheobronchial epithelial in this we investigated the effects of all-trans-retinoic acid (trans-ra) and receptor class-selective retinoids on the growth and apoptosis of human lung cancer cell trans-ra significantly inhibited the growth of calu-6 and h460 accompanied by induction of ra receptor (rar) beta in it had little effect on the growth of sk-mes-1 and h661 lung cancer cell in which rar beta expression was not stable expression of rar beta in rar trans-ra-resistant sk-mes-1 and h661 lung cancer cells led to recovery of trans-ra-induced growth which only at low serum using fluorescent microscopy and the terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (tdt) we demonstrated that induction of apoptosis by trans-ra contributed to its growth-inhibitory effect in trans-ra-sensitive lung cancer cell analysis of rar-selective and retinoid x receptor (rxr)-selective retionoids showed that activation of both rars and rxrs could induce growth inhibition in trans-ra-sensitive lung cancer an additive synergistic effect on growth inhibition and rar beta induction was observed when cells were treated with combinations of rar-selective and rxr-selective our results show that expression of rar beta plays a role in mediating retinoid response in lung cancer cells and that activation of rars or rxrs contributes to induction of rar growth inhibition and apoptosis by

combined inhibitory effect of fluoride and hypothiocyanite on the viability and glucose metabolism of streptococcus serotype the separate and combined effects of peroxidase-generated hypothiocyanite (hoscn/oscn-) and f- ions on glucose uptake and growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 were mutans cells were grown to late exponential or stationary growth washed and suspended in ml of sterilized human whole saliva supplemented with 10 mm this saliva-bacteria mixture was supplemented with 5-150 microm h2o2 at ph or at ph up to 103 +/- 21 microm hoscn/oscn- was after 20 h of incubation at 37 degrees the saliva-bacteria suspension exposed to hoscn/oscn- were plated on mitis salivarius agar plates and incubated anaerobically for 2 identical experiments were made with f- ions and both hoscn/oscn- and f- caused a significant dose-dependent growth inhibition at ph whereas no inhibition was observed at ph when f- and hoscn/oscn- were added simultaneously at ph an additive effect of growth inhibition was in glucose incorporation experiments the bacteria-saliva mixture was exposed to 1 microm mm f- or hoscn/oscn- or their combination in sterilized whole saliva at ph caused and these observations indicate that f- and hoscn/oscn- ions have an additive inhibitory effect on mutans and therefore their combination is likely to be more antibacterial than either agent
effects of unilateral upper incisor extraction on facial growth of young the effects of unilateral extraction of the upper incisor (one tooth) on facial growth of young rats were the remaining upper incisor showed deviation towards the opposite and there was regular dental wear of all the the effects were evident only in the mid-facial cephalometric measurements showed significant shortening with deviation of the incisor bone on the extraction there was no significant disturbance of the growth of the rest of the maxilla and these results indicate that upper incisor extractions have a localized leading to impairment of incisor bone
interleukin-10 inhibits the autocrine growth of leukemic blast cells from patients with acute myeloblastic the effect of interleukin-10 (il-10) on the growth of leukemic blast cells from patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (aml) is in need of we therefore examined the effect of il-10 on aml cells obtained from 10 although granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g-csf) and/or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) was able to stimulate the growth of aml progenitor cells to form leukemic blast il-10 itself demonstrated no leukemic blast colony-forming activity and no synergistic stimulating activity with other leukemic blast colonies were formed without the addition of exogenous cytokines in four cases and il-10 suppressed these spontaneous colony formations in two of the four since the production of g-csf and gm-csf was observed in these two the presence of an autocrine growth mechanism mediated by these cytokines was when serial concentrations of il-10 were the production of g-csf and gm-csf was dramatically inhibited in a dose-dependent these findings suggested that il-10 could suppress the autocrine growth of aml cells by inhibiting their production of g-csf and/or in the administration of il-10 may be harmless to normal hematopoiesis because il-10 did not suppress the growth of normal hematopoietic progenitor our study provides experimental support for the clinical application of il-10 in patients with
thanatophoric dysplasia type new there is some question about whether the two forms of thanatophoric dysplasia type ii with and type i without cloverleaf belong to the same we investigated one 6-day-old td with cloverleaf skull using examination of the external skeleton large section detailed section and the loss of the three-phase contours-characteristics for type i (54)--in certain the absence of the perichondral spurs to some and their substitution by a structure similar to the perichondral of have a suggested origin in normal cartilage-bone the same mechanism is postulated (a) for the appearance of less bent or normally shaped tubular bones compared with td type and their corresponding increased mechanical and (b) for the less amount of platyspondyly in type ii than in type we suggest that the malformation of the cloverleaf skull has its origin in the promontory growth of the relatively normal cartilage-bone tissues at the skull base resulting in an early synostosis and a consecutive fusion of the cranial the ultrastructural analysis of chondrocytes demonstrates the significant contribution of electron microscopy for td we suggest that pathologically altered light chondrocytes accounts for plump cross-striated collagen the reduced cellular and the impaired formation of columnar and hypertrophic it is clear that normal cartilage-bone tissue distributed among tissue is the reason for the differences between type i and type hypotheses are presented that explain this tissue td type i and td type ii do not represent two different entities but the same entity with varying features due to mutational events occurring at different
antitumor and chemosensitizing effects of 3-chloroprocainamide an analog of metoclopramide dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth in scid mice xenografted with a human brain astrocytoma (t24) when given intramuscularly to mice every third day for 14-20 3-cpa was shown to have the same efficacy on tumor growth inhibition as neutral metoclopramide (neutral mca) at the doses of 10-40 mg/kg when evaluated by tumor doubling tumor growth time for tumor volumes to reach 1000 mm3 and area under growth 3-cpa at the dose of 3 x 40 mg/kg was also shown to enhance the cytotoxicity induced by a single dose of cisplatin at a dose of < or = 160 mg/kg of 3-cpa did not show any notable extrapyramidal symptoms which was observed for neutral mca treated mice at the dose of 20 the lethal response dose of 3-cpa for scid mice was 320 mg/kg which is 4 times higher than that determined for neutral mca (80 these results support 3-cpa as a good candidate drug representing a new generation of benzamides for further clinical development as a cancer therapy
enhancement of blue-light sensitivity of arabidopsis seedlings by a blue light receptor cryptochrome cryptochrome is a group of flavin-type blue light receptors that regulate plant growth and the function of arabidopsis cryptochrome 2 in the early photomorphogenesis of seedlings was studied by using transgenic plants overexpressing cry2 and cry2 mutant plants accumulating no cry2 it is found that cryptochrome 2 mediates blue light-dependent inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and stimulation of cotyledon opening under low intensities of blue in contrast to the expression of cry2 is rapidly down-regulated by blue light in a light-intensity dependent which provides a molecular mechanism to explain at least in part that cryptochrome 2 functions primarily under low light during the early development of
protein lipid interaction in effects of biliary proteins on the stability of cholesterol-lecithin the nucleation of cholesterol crystals is an obligatory precursor to cholesterol gallstone in is believed to be preceded by aggregation and fusion of cholesterol-rich we have investigated the effects of two putative pro-nucleating a concanavalin a-binding protein fraction and a calcium-binding on the stability of sonicated small unilamellar cholesterol-lecithin vesicle aggregation is followed by monitoring and upon addition of the concanavalin a-binding protein fraction the absorbance of a vesicle dispersion increases continuously with vesicle fusion is probed by a fluorescence contents-mixing vesicles apparently fuse slowly after the addition of the concanavalin a-binding although inner filter effects confound the quantitative measurement of fusion the rates of change of absorbance and fluorescence increase with the concentration of the and the second-order dimerization rate constant increases with both the protein concentration and the cholesterol content of the on the other the calcium-binding protein has no effect on the stability of the vesicle this protein may therefore affect cholesterol crystal formation not by promoting the nucleation but by enhancing crystal growth and our results demonstrate that biliary proteins can destabilize lipid vesicles and that different proteins play different roles in the mechanism of cholesterol gallstone copyright 1998 elsevier science
long [r3] insulin-like growth factor-i reduces plasma growth igf binding protein-3 and endogenous igf-i concentrations in growth hormone (gh) improves growth performance in the analogues of insulin-like growth factor-i (igf-i) that bind poorly to igf binding proteins (igfbp) stimulate growth in the rat in inhibit growth in the this study was designed to determine the effect of igf peptides alone or in combination with porcine gh (pgh) on growth characteristics and plasma hormone concentrations in finisher a four-day infusion of long [r3] igf-i 180 micrograms/kg/day) decreased the average daily food and plasma igf-i and insulin the mean plasma gh concentration was decreased by 23% and the area under the gh peaks was reduced by co-administration of pgh (30 micrograms/kg/day) with lr3igf-i had no interactive effect on growth and plasma igfbp-3 and igf-i concentrations remained the area under the gh peaks was not restored with this combination treatment although mean plasma gh concentrations were elevated in all animals receiving infusion of igf-i (180 micrograms/kg/day) decreased plasma insulin and mean gh concentrations but had no significant effect on igfbp-3 average daily gain and feed intake were not changed by igf-i a combination of igf-i and pgh injection (30 micrograms/kg/day) increased plasma igfbp-3 concentrations but plasma insulin levels remained plasma glucose levels were unaffected by any the study demonstrates that both igf-i and lr3igf-i suppress plasma gh concentrations in finisher in may be responsible for the reduction in the plasma concentration of igfbp-3 and insulin seen in lr3igf-i-treated the decrease in these parameters may contribute to the inhibitory effect of lr3igf-i on growth performance in the
the conserved carboxyl terminus and zinc finger-like domain of the co-chaperone ydj1 assist hsp70 in protein ydj1 is a member of the hsp40 (dnaj-related) chaperone family that facilitates cellular protein folding by regulating hsp70 atpase activity and binding unfolded ydj1 contains four conserved subdomains that appear to represent functional to define the action of these protease-resistant ydj1 fragments and ydj1 mutants were analyzed for activities exhibited by the unmodified the ydj1 mutant proteins analyzed were unable to support growth of yeast at elevated temperatures and were found to have alterations in the j-domain (ydj1 zinc finger-like region (ydj1 and conserved carboxyl terminus (ydj1 fragment ydj1 (1-90) contains the j-domain and a small portion of the g/f-rich region and could regulate hsp70 atpase activity but could not suppress the aggregation of the model protein ydj1 h34q could not regulate the atpase activity of hsp70 but could bind unfolded the j-domain functions independently and was sufficient to regulate hsp70 atpase fragment ydj1 (179-384) could suppress rhodanese aggregation but was unable to regulate ydj1 (179-384) contains the conserved carboxyl terminus of dnaj but is missing the g/f-rich and a major portion of the zinc finger-like ydj1 g315d exhibited severe defects in its ability to suppress rhodanese aggregation and form complexes with unfolded the conserved carboxyl terminus of ydj1 appeared to participate in the binding of unfolded ydj1 c159t could form stable complexes with unfolded proteins and suppress protein aggregation but was inefficient at refolding denatured the zinc finger-like region of ydj1 appeared to function in conjunction with the conserved carboxyl terminus to fold ydj1 does not require an intact zinc finger-like region to bind unfolded these data suggest that the combined functions of the zinc finger-like and the conserved carboxyl terminus are required for ydj1 to cooperate with hsp70 and facilitate protein folding in the
comparative intraosseal growth of human prostate cancer cell lines lncap and pc-3 in the nude more than 75% of patients with advanced prostate carcinoma have skeletal which is the principal metastatic site and the major complication of this the goal of this work was to compare the osseous metastasis of androgen-sensitive and insensitive prostate cancers in the nude materials and androgen-sensitive lncap or -insensitive pc-3 human prostate carcinoma cells were injected directly into the femur medullas of male nude beige the animals were then sacrificed at successive time intervals to study the gross and microscopic characteristics of the established lncap and pc-3 both colonized in the bone marrow within a then gradually expanded to the entire bone medulla followed by osseous infiltration to produce obvious symptoms in the affected based on the both osteoblastic and osteolytic changes occurred during the course of tumor in pc-3 tumors eventually broke through the bone invaded the surrounding and metastasized to the regional lymph in lncap remained localized within the and appeared to eventually regress and die after displacing the normal bone marrow lncap tumors were consistently positive for prostate-specific antigen in bone while pc-3 tumors were tumor cell nuclei of both pc-3 and lncap hybridized to a human repeated sequence dna probe indicating that the proliferating malignant cells were of human these cancer cell lines produced a high incidence of growth in the bone that differed in the relative malignancy of these cell lines was demonstrated in this
effect of interleukin-1 and dexamethasone on interleukin-6 production and growth in human interleukin-6 (il-6) has been shown to be released by cultured human meningioma cells and may be a positive or negative regulator of tumour il-6 protein and mrna levels have been examined in a series of in 14 the results are compared with the effects of il-6 and dexamethasone on growth and il-6 secretion in tumours with the highest in vivo il-6 mrna expression also showed maximum induction of il-6 and increased cellular proliferation on il-1 stimulation in dexamethasone decreased the il-1-stimulated il-6 release in all meningiomas which had little or no il-6 message were refractory to il-1 control of these formed the group of meningiomas that increased their growth rate in response to
expression of sex hormone-binding globulin exon vii splicing variant messenger ribonucleic acid in human ovarian to investigate the expression of sex hormone-binding globulin (shbg) exon vii splicing variant messenger rna (mrna) in human ovarian the expression of shbg variant mrna in normal uterine endometrium and endometriotic tissue was department of obstetrics and gifu university fourteen women with endometriosis and 18 women without normal uterine endometrial and ovarian endometriotic tissues from patients who had undergone gynecological surgery were main outcome levels of shbg wild-type and variant mrnas were determined using the quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain analysis of the missing base pairs proved that they corresponded to the entire exon there was no significant difference between the levels of shbg wild-type mrna in normal endometria and in endometriotic although the levels of shbg variant mrna in endometriotic endometria were significantly higher than that in normal the ratio of shbg variant to wild-type mrna levels was significantly higher in endometriotic endometria than in normal this study demonstrates the coexpression of shbg exon vii splicing variant mrna with its wild-type and the dominant expression of the variant in ovarian these results might be involved in the cellular estrogenic plausibly assisting in the development and growth of ovarian
hyp loci control cell pattern formation in the vegetative mycelium of aspergillus aspergillus nidulans grows by apical extension of multinucleate cells called hyphae that are subdivided by the insertion of crosswalls called apical cells vary in length and number of whereas subapical cells are typically 40 microm long with three to four apical cells have active mitotic whereas subapical cells are arrested for growth and mitosis until branch formation reinitiates tip growth and nuclear this multicellular growth pattern requires coordination between localized nuclear and we searched a temperature-sensitive mutant collection for strains with conditional defects in growth patterning and identified six mutants (designated hyp for the identified hyp mutations are recessive defects in five unlinked genes phenotypic analyses showed that these hyp mutants have aberrant patterns of septation and show defects in polarity establishment and tip but they have normal nuclear division cycles and can complete the asexual growth cycle at restrictive temperature shift analysis revealed that hypd and hype play general roles in hyphal since inactivation of these genes resulted in a general widening of apical and subapical loss of hypa or hypb function lead to a cessation of apical cell growth but activated isotropic growth and mitosis in subapical the inferred functions of hypa and hypb suggest a mechanism for coordinating apical subapical cell and mitosis in
tumour tissue is a source of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase sialoform in the sera of melanoma-bearing the total serum activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (ggt) was shown to increase with the growth of transplantable b16 and s91 melanomas in inbred in an effort to define the source of the ggt shed into the bloodstream the physicochemical characteristics of the partially purified ggt isoforms from serum and b16 melanoma were the molecular weights of the serum and melanoma isoforms were identical (86 kda) and differed from that of the liver isoform (69 in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the serum and melanoma isoforms had a similar mobility which exceeded that of the liver treatment of the enzyme preparations with neuraminidase removed the differences in the electrophoretic mobility of the three ggt isoforms on ion exchange chromatography on a deae-spheron 300 lc column the melanoma and serum isoforms had an affinity to the sorbent unlike the liver our observations suggest that melanoma cells express a sialoform of ggt which is responsible for an increase in the total ggt serum biochemical and histochemical analyses did not reveal any increase in liver ggt production associated with melanoma detection of the ggt isoform of tumour origin in sera ranks ggt among the specific melanoma
improvement of the production of foreign proteins using a heterologous secretion vector system in bacillus effects of resistance to glucose-mediated catabolite to improve protein a heterologous secretion vector system was constructed with the aid of the amyr2 the operator sequence (amyo) of the amyr2 region on the secretion vector was changed through site-directed mutagenesis to eliminate carbon-source-mediated catabolite three substitutional one deletional (delta and one insertional (aghf) mutant promoters were the expression level and the degree of catabolite repression of amyr2 and the mutant promoters were examined with a single copy system using an integrational promoter probe under glucose-free culture expression levels from all mutant promoters except hh were to fold higher than that from while the expression of the amyr2 promoter was repressed by 90% in the presence of 2% expression levels of the mutant promoters were repressed by only 1% to to evaluate the advantage of the mutant promoters in production of foreign proteins by the heterologous secretion beta-lactamase and human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (hpsti) were expressed by the mutant when subtilis lks87 was used as a host the production of the target proteins using the respective mutant promoter was increased by about fold under glucose-free culture under the high glucose culture secretion of target proteins produced from the mutant promoters increased to 2 whereas those by the amyr2 promoter were reduced to between 50% and the additive effect of deguh mutation on protein production was not observed under high glucose culture in such culture conditions inhibited proteolytic degradation of secreted target proteins after the stationary growth phase even in subtilis lks88 (deguh our results indicated that the mutant which are resistant to glucose-mediated catabolite are very useful for over-production of foreign proteins under the high glucose culture conditions using the heterologous expression-secretion system in

corticotropin regulates vascular endothelial growth factor expression in human fetal adrenal cortical the human adrenal cortex has a complex vasculature that is essential for organ and access of secreted hormones to the growth and function of the adrenal cortex are regulated by corticotropin the actions of which are in part mediated by locally produced growth as cortical growth and vascularization must increase in a coordinated we hypothesized that acth also influences adrenal cortical angiogenesis by stimulating the local expression of specific angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) is a potent endothelial cell-specific angiogenic the expression of which has been detected in adrenal cortical we examined the localization of vegf expression in the midgestation (16-20 weeks) human fetal adrenal cortex and determined whether vegf expression and secretion by isolated human fetal adrenal cortical cells are regulated by by immunohistochemical strong cytoplasmic staining for vegf was detected in scattered clusters of fetal zone (inner cortical compartment) in cells in the definitive zone of the cortex stained only weakly for the predominant staining for vegf in the fetal zone correlated with the extensive vasculature of this zone as detected by immunohistochemical staining for von willebrand which is specific for endothelial in primary cultures of human fetal adrenal cortical acth (1 nmol/l) and forskolin (10 micromol/l) increased the abundance of messenger ribonucleic acid transcripts encoding as assessed by northern and slot blot the stimulatory effect of acth and forskolin on vegf gene expression occurred within 2 h of agonist exposure and persisted for at least 24 acth and forskolin also increased vegf protein secretion by fetal adrenal cortical as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for vegf in fetal adrenal cortical cell-conditioned a significant (p < increase in vegf secretion was detected as early as 8 h after acth or forskolin by 24 h after the addition of acth or vegf secreted from isolated human fetal adrenal cells was increased 5- to these data demonstrate that the human fetal adrenal particularly the cells of the inner fetal express vegf and that vegf expression and secretion by these cells are directly regulated by acth and the activation of adenylate vegf may be a local regulator of adrenal cortical angiogenesis and an important mediator of the tropic action of ensuring the coordination of acth-stimulated cortical growth and
fetal growth retardation and second trimester maternal serum human chorionic gonadotrophin second trimester maternal serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hcg) levels in women who remained normotensive but delivered an unexplained growth retarded infant were compared with those from a control group and a group of women who developed pre-eclampsia in a retrospective observational our hypothesis was that the similar placental pathological changes shared by unexplained normotensive iugr and pre-eclampsia would be reflected by elevated maternal serum hcg levels in the second normotensive women delivering unexplained singleton growth retarded infants were identified (n=43) and their second trimester hcg taken as part of antenatal screening for were these were compared with a control group of 625 and a group of 48 women who subsequently developed there was no significant difference in the hcg levels expressed as multiples of the median (mom) between the women who delivered growth retarded fetuses (median mom and the control group (median mom the levels of hcg in the women who subsequently developed pre-eclampsia were significantly higher (median mom there were no significant differences in afp levels in the three the trend was towards a higher level of afp in the fetal growth retardation maternal serum hcg in the second trimester does not appear to be elevated in normotensive women who later produce a growth retarded although human chorionic gonadotrophin levels are significantly higher in women who subsequently develop

estrogen receptor-negative epithelial cells in mouse mammary gland development and the mouse mammary gland undergoes rapid proliferation during then cyclical proliferation and involution during adulthood within a 5-day estrous although proliferation of mammary epithelial cells is directed by elevated serum levels of estrogen acting via the estrogen receptor the er status of the proliferating cells remains we examined the er expression of proliferating epithelial cell types during pubertal development and normal adult growth using simultaneous immunohistochemistry for er and tritiated thymidine (3h-tdr) these studies demonstrate that during pubertal growth (4-6 weeks) er-negative cells comprise more than 50% of the epithelial cell populations in the terminal end buds (tebs) and the majority of proliferating cells in both tebs and ducts are these findings indicate that proliferation of cells within both the tebs and the mammary ducts contribute to pubertal growth of the mammary gland and that the greater proportion of dividing cells are similar patterns of cell growth were observed in the normal estrous cycle when the majority of dividing cells were er-negative during both pro-estrous and intensive labelling of cells with 3h-tdr was used to identify long-lived mammary epithelial cells which retained 3h-tdr 2 weeks following labelling following 3 estrous of the small number of mammary epithelial cells retaining 3h-tdr most were er-positive luminal cells and only a few were er-negative basal this study indicates that pubertal growth of the mammary gland comprises division of er-negative cap cells and of both er-negative and er-positive cells in the body of the tebs and elongating mammary estrogen-driven proliferation of er-negative and er-positive luminal cells and er-negative basal cells maintains the differentiated mammary gland in the adult
fetal and neonatal mortality in the postterm the impact of gestational age and fetal growth our purpose was to examine the impact of gestational age and fetal growth restriction on fetal and neonatal mortality rates in the postterm study all deliveries occurring in sweden between and were evaluated for participation in this data were derived from the national swedish medical birth pregnancies were selected for inclusion in the study on the basis of the following (1) singleton (2) reliable (3) gestational age > or = 40 and (4) maternal age 15 to 44 fetal growth restriction was defined as birth weight <2 sd below the mean for gestational a total of pregnancies met the inclusion criteria and formed the study fetal and neonatal mortalities at 40 gestation were used as reference logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the independent effects of gestational age and fetal growth restriction on fetal and neonatal mortality a significant rise in the odds ratio for fetal death was detected from 41 gestation and on (odds ratios and at and 43 odds ratios for neonatal mortality did not demonstrate a significant gestational age fetal growth restriction was associated with significantly higher odds ratios for both fetal and neonatal mortality rates at every gestational age examined (with odds ratios ranging from to for fetal death and from to for neonatal postterm pregnancies have long been considered to be at high risk for adverse perinatal this study documents a small but significant increase in fetal mortality in accurately dated pregnancies that extend beyond 41 weeks of this study also demonstrates that fetal growth restriction is independently associated with increased perinatal mortality in these
microbial photodegradation of metabolism of 2-amino-4-nitrophenol by rhodobacter the phototrophic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus photoreduces to which is further metabolized by an aerobic pathway that is also the catabolism of 2-amino-4-nitrophenol requires o2 and the presence of alternative carbon (c) and nitrogen (n) preferably acetate and rhodobacter capsulatus a bacterium unable to assimilate releases negligible amounts of nitrite when growing with thus suggesting that an nitrite-producing activity is not involved in the metabolization of the the diazotrophic growth of capsulatus increases in the presence of but growth with ammonium is clearly inhibited by the mutant strains of capsulatus which are affected in or nifr4 unable to fix do not grow with 2-amino-4-nitrophenol as the sole n this indicates that the compound cannot be used as a n the nif mutants degrade 2-amino-4-nitrophenol to the same extent as the wild-type in the presence of the compound is not used as a c source by the aromatic stable such as or are not detectable in microaerobic cultures of capsulatus growing with or
heterochronic processes in human an ontogenetic analysis of the hominid changes in pelvic shape in human ontogeny and hominid phylogeny suggest that the heterochronic processes involved differ greatly from the neotenic process traditionally described in the evolution of the the morphology of 150 juvenile and adult pelves of african 60 juvenile and adult pelves of modern two adult pelves and a juvenile hip bone of australopithecines (sts al mld 7) was multivariate ontogenetic and growth curves confirm that the pelvic growth pattern in humans differs markedly from those of the african the results permit the following the appearance of a new feature (acetabulo-cristal buttress and cristal tubercle) at the time of human birth allows the addition of such as the attainment of a proportionally narrower with more sagittally positioned iliac pelvic proportions and orientation change progressively in early childhood as bipedalism is other changes in pelvic proportions occur later with the adolescent growth comparison of juvenile and adult australopithecines to modern humans indicates that 1) some pelvic traits of adult australopithecus resemble those of neonate 2) the pelvic growth of australopithecus was probably closer to that of than to that of and 3) prolonged growth in length of hindlimb and pelvis after sexual maturity seems to be a unique feature of the position of the acetabulo-cristal buttress and of the cristal tubercle on the ilium are similar in adult australopithecus and neonate homo suggesting that this feature may have been displaced later during hominid progressive displacement of the acetabulo-cristal buttress on the ilium occurs both during hominid evolution (from australopithecus to homo sapiens) and human growth (from neonate to this suggests peramorphic evolution of the pelvic morphology of hominids combining three processes of recapitulation acceleration and time the results lend credence to the hypothesis that no single heterochronic process accounts for all human evolutionary rather this reflects a combination of relative changes in growth rhythm and including other such as the appearance of new morphological

morphological and functional evidence for enhanced growth and potassium-evoked dopamine release in striatal grafts innervated with a patchy growth an in oculo nigrostriatal cograft during development of the nigrostriatal dopamine a patchy and a diffuse type of striatal innervation pattern can be it has been suggested that when fetal dopaminergic obtained from the ventral mesencephalon are grafted adjacent to mature striatal only the diffuse growth is intraocular grafting studies have indicated that the dopaminergic growth pattern might be influenced by the age of the target the lateral ganglionic eminence in this study vm grafts were allowed to innervate lge grafts of different fetal vm was implanted next to 2-wk-old or 26-day-old striatal in oculo and the resulting dopaminergic innervation of the striatal grafts was studied using tyrosine hydroxylase (th) in striatal grafts receiving innervation at the age of 2 wk in a patchy th-immunoreactive growth pattern was while in striatal grafts innervated at the age of 26 days mainly the diffuse growth pattern was this implies that grafted striatum reached maturity at approximately 1 mo of the age of the dopaminergic neurons at dissection and grafting was also studied concerning the ability to induce patchy growth into mature vm dissected from 13- and 18-mm fetuses was implanted to either 4-mo-old lge (grafted in sequence) or to lge from the same fetus (grafted simultaneously) as th-positive innervation of striatal evaluated 4 wk after implantation of revealed a patchy growth pattern in lge grafted simultaneously with 13- and 18-mm when the striatum was mature at the time of diffuse growth was observed in striatum innervated by vm dissected from 13-mm patchy growth was noted in striatal areas close to vm grafts when the dopaminergic neurons were derived from older fetuses (crl 18 potassium-induced dopamine release was greater in striatal grafts exhibiting the patchy growth than those showing the diffuse pattern of in patchy dopaminergic growth can be induced in mature striatal tissue by grafting vm from older potassium-evoked dopamine release is enhanced in dopaminergic these results have implications in terms of finding ways to induce patchy growth when grafting to the mature striatum of patients suffering from
cooperativity between the polyamine pathway and her-2neu in transformation of human mammary epithelial cells in role of the mapk our experiments were designed to test the cooperativity between the polyamine pathway and her-2neu in inducing transformation of human mammary epithelial cells in using the mcf-10a breast epithelial cell we observed that induction of overexpression of ornithine decarboxylase (odc) (the first rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis) markedly potentiated the anchorage-independent growth stimulating effect of the beta2 isoform of neu differentiating factor (ndf) known to activate her-2neu in mcf-10a odc on the other did not enhance growth in liquid thus pointing to a specific effect on transformation rather than odc-overexpressing mcf-10a cells exhibited increased mapk phosphorylation in response to administration of ndf and/or epidermal growth factor in the phosphorylation of the members of the stress-activated protein kinase cascade p38 and sek were not affected by odc of in the absence of egf and odc overexpression failed to induce both clonogenicity and mapk these results suggest that increased polyamine biosynthetic activity critically interacts with her-2neu in promoting human mammary cell transformation in culture and that the mapk cascade is an important mediator of this if confirmed in future in vivo our results may identify important new targets for the chemoprevention of human breast
growth inhibition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells by human cytidine deaminase requires the catalytic function of the previous studies have indicated that cytidine deaminase (cdd) is a potent growth inhibitor of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells in this we have undertaken molecular cloning and purification of recombinant human cdd to elucidate the growth regulatory potential and mechanism behind the growth suppressive the purified protein had a specific activity of x 10(5) u/mg and a km value of 30 in the gm-cfc the recombinant protein was shown to reduce colony formation to 50% at 16 pmol/l as was observed with cdd derived from granulocyte the effect depended on the presence of thymidine (>/= 4 x 10(-5) these results imply that cdd is an extremely potent inhibitor of gm-cfc and that no additional factor from the granulocyte extract is required for the growth inhibitory modification of cdd by truncation from the c-terminal or by amino acid substitution of an active site glutamate eliminated both the enzyme activity and the growth regulatory potential of cdd from escherichia coli was found to be even more effective than human cdd in growth suppression of with 10-fold higher inhibitory activity corresponding to a 10-fold higher enzymatic taken these results show that the catalytic nucleoside deaminating function of the protein is essential for the growth suppressive effect of most cdd exerts growth inhibition by depleting the cytidine and deoxycytidine pool required for dna as addition of deoxycytidine which is not a substrate for neutralizes the inhibiting
positive versus negative signaling by lymphocyte antigen antigen receptors on lymphocytes play a central role in immune regulation by transmitting signals that positively or negatively regulate lymphocyte and this review focuses on how opposing positive or negative cellular responses are brought about by antigen receptor four types of extracellular inputs shape the response to (a) the concentration of (b) the avidity with which antigen is (c) the timing and duration of antigen and (d) the association of antigen with costimuli from the innate immune or other intracellular signaling by antigen receptors is not an all-or-none and these external variables alter both the quantity and quality of recent findings in b lymphocytes have clearly illustrated that these external inputs affect the magnitude and duration of the intracellular calcium which in turn contributes to differential triggering of the transcriptional regulators nf kappa and the regulation of calcium responses involves a network of tyrosine kinases tyrosine or lipid phosphatases and accessory molecules fcr gamma understanding the biochemistry and logic behind these integrative processes will allow development of more selective and efficient pharmaceuticals that or augment immune responses in and
predicted and observed growth of listeria monocytogenes in seafood challenge tests and in naturally contaminated cold-smoked the performance of the pathogen modelling the food the murphy-model and the ross-model for growth of monocytogenes was evaluated by comparison with data from 100 seafood challenge tests and data from 13 storage trials with naturally contaminated sliced vacuum-packed cold-smoked challenge tests with both cured and noncured products were and graphs as well as the bias- and the accuracy factors were used for comparison of the observed and predicted the pathogen modelling program could not be successfully validated in seafood challenge growth rates were markedly overestimated and the mu(max)-bias factor was as high as in challenge tests with cured on the basis of the effect of nacl/a(w) and the mu(max)-bias factor of the other three models varied between and in the challenge tests with cured and noncured none of the models accurately predicted the growth in both cured and noncured the results indicated that a new expanded including the additional effect of lactate and may provide accurate predictions of the growth of monocytogenes in challenge tests with various types of storage trials clearly showed the growth of monocytogenes in naturally contaminated cold-smoked salmon to be markedly slower than growth in inoculated challenge all four models substantially overestimated growth in the naturally contaminated nacl/a(w) and lactate were measured in the storage trials and on the basis of these the food micromodel mu(max)-bias factor was the model could not be successfully validated with naturally contaminated cold-smoked to improve the applicability of predictive models to fish it is suggested to include studies with naturally contaminated products in the development and validation of models with seafood
puberty in the female tammar the growth and timing of female puberty in a seasonally breeding the tammar was examined in wild and captive defined as the time of first estrus and can occur at any time of the sixty percent of young wild females went through puberty in late 3 mo before the normal adult mating season in late but puberty was delayed in captive animals kept with a low ratio of males to during initial 19% of these captive animals were infertile as judged by failure to in the puberty occurred well before the animals were fully grown (body weight kg adult only 3% of animals with a body weight below kg had attainment of a minimum body weight was a key prerequisite associated with progesterone concentrations in the peripheral plasma of prepubertal females were not significantly different from those of adult females during the nonbreeding season 142+/-121 194+/-105 p > there was a significant increase in progesterone (322+/-242 p < in the postpubertal females (ovulating but still < kg body weight) even though the corpus luteum was quiescent after its there was no increase in plasma progesterone before the first these data confirm that estrus does not require a change in the and that a ovulation does not precede the first estrus in this so that the onset of puberty coincides with the first behavioral estrus and when the animals have reached a body weight of 2 although adult female tammars are strict seasonal with 6 mo of seasonal quiescence from the winter to the summer young females can go through puberty at any time of the the unique feature of the female tammar wallaby is that it does not become a seasonally breeding mammal until after when it has acquired a corpus
the effect of dietary protein level on the lysine and arginine requirements of growing comparisons were made of the growth and carcass fat responses to dietary lysine and of the lysine requirements of 1-wk-old broiler chickens receiving diets containing either 23 or 25% similar comparisons were made of the responses elicited by dietary arginine in diets containing 18 or 23% dietary the responses to lysine supplementation and the lysine requirements of chicks receiving 23 or 25% protein diets were in comparing the 18 or 20% to the 23% protein the initial responses of growth and feed efficiency to dietary lysine were but the maximal weight gain diminished as dietary protein leading to a decrease in the lysine the amounts of extractable carcass fat or abdominal fat pad increased as dietary protein was lowered in were reduced either by lysine or arginine percentage of pectoral muscle increased slightly with dietary arginine and protein the results suggest that when total dietary amino acid level is the requirements for the individual amino acid decrease due to growth retardation resulting from single or multiple amino acid single amino acid supplementation of low protein diet is more effective in improving the amino acid balance than supplementation of high protein resulting in a further decrease in the
effects of iron and temperature on expression of the pseudomonas aeruginosa tolqra role of the ferric uptake the tolqra genes have been recently identified in pseudomonas aeruginosa in this we examined the effect of iron and temperature on tolqra a promoterless lacz gene was introduced downstream of plasmid-encoded tolq and and expression was monitored by measuring beta-galactosidase activity of addition of 25 microm fecl3 to the culture medium reduced tolqra expression by 50 to 60% in pao but by only 25% in the fur mutant pao northern hybridization analysis revealed that iron regulation occurs at the level of transcription and involves the aeruginosa ferric uptake regulator primer extension analysis was used to identify the proposed transcriptional start site of although a putative fur box was identified 20 bp upstream of the proposed start purified fur did not bind to the tola or tolqr promoter regions in an in vitro gel retardation iron regulation of the tol genes appears to involve an intermediate regulatory expression of tolqr and tola was optimal at 37 degrees c and was reduced by 40 to 50% when cultures were grown at either 42 or 25 growth in high-iron medium at 25 degrees c further reduced tolqr and tola
effect of cadmium(ii) on the extent of oxidative dna damage in primary brain cell cultures from pleurodeles compounds of cadmium(ii) are well-known human and animal they affect growth and brain functions at subacute environmental concentrations in experimental we investigated the potential of cadmium(ii) to induce oxidative dna damage in brain cell cultures obtained from larvae of pleurodeles as indicators of dna lesions typical of oxygen free we determined the frequencies of dna strand breaks and of dna base modifications recognized by the bacterial formamidopyrimidine-dna glycosylase (fpg dna strand breaks were generated in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 1 microm and in no significant increase in fpg-sensitive sites was observed under our experimental the repair of fpg-sensitive dna lesions induced by visible light was slightly diminished at 1 microm and inhibited completely at 10 microm of while the closure of dna strand breaks was not our results show although cadmium is not able to induce oxidative dna base modifications in larval brain cells its capability to generate dna strand breaks and to interfere with the repair of oxidative dna damage could explain the early life stage neurotoxicity of this

tocotrienols inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cells irrespective of estrogen receptor potential antiproliferative effects of the major vitamin e component in palm were investigated on the growth of both estrogen-responsive (er+) mcf7 human breast cancer cells and estrogen-unresponsive (er-) mda-mb-231 human breast cancer and effects were compared with those of alpha-tocopherol the tocotrienol-rich fraction (trf) of palm oil inhibited growth of mcf7 cells in both the presence and absence of estradiol with a nonlinear dose-response but such that complete suppression of growth was achieved at 8 mda-mb-231 cells were also inhibited by trf but with a linear dose-response such that 20 microg/ml trf was needed for complete growth separation of the trf into individual tocotrienols revealed that all fractions could inhibit growth of both er+ and er- cells and of er+ cells in both the presence and absence of the gamma- and delta-fractions were the most complete inhibition of mcf7 cell growth was achieved at 6 microg/ml of gamma-tocotrienol/delta-tocotrienol (gammat3/deltat3) in the absence of estradiol and 10 microg/ml of deltat3 in the presence of whereas complete suppression of mda-mb-231 cell growth was not achieved even at concentrations of 10 microg/ml of by contrast to these inhibitory effects of alphat had no inhibitory effect on mcf7 cell growth in either the presence or the absence of nor on mda-mb-231 cell these results confirm studies using other sublines of human breast cancer cells and demonstrate that tocotrienols can exert direct inhibitory effects on the growth of breast cancer in searching for the mechanism of studies of the effects of trf on estrogen-regulated ps2 gene expression in mcf7 cells showed that tocotrienols do not act via an estrogen receptor-mediated pathway and must therefore act differently from estrogen tocotrienols did not increase levels of growth-inhibitory insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (igfbp) in mcf7 implying also a different mechanism from that proposed for retinoic acid inhibition of estrogen-responsive breast cancer cell inhibition of the growth of breast cancer cells by tocotrienols could have important clinical implications not only because tocotrienols are able to inhibit the growth of both er+ and er- phenotypes but also because er+ cells could be growth-inhibited in the presence as well as in the absence of future clinical applications of trf could come from potential growth suppression of er+ breast cancer cells otherwise resistant to growth inhibition by antiestrogens and retinoic
suppression of hypercholesterolemia in hepatoma-bearing rats by cabbage extract and its s-methyl-l-cysteine the effect of cabbage extract on cholesterol metabolism was studied in donryu rats subcutaneously implanted with an ascites hepatoma cell line the hepatoma-bearing rats exhibited hypercholesterolemia induced by increasing cholesterogenesis in the host liver and decreasing steroid excretion into the cabbage extract intake or administration reduced serum cholesterol level and enhanced fecal bile acid excretion and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid in the microsomal fraction of the s-methyl-l-cysteine a component of could mimic the effect of cabbage extract when orally these results suggest that cabbage suppresses hypercholesterolemia responding to hepatoma growth by upregulating cholesterol catabolism and that s-methyl-l-cysteine sulfoxide in cabbage is one of the factors suppressing hypercholesterolemia in the hepatoma-bearing

dna damage in mussels at sites in san diego identification and assessment of introduced and other toxicants is crucial to any comprehensive study of contaminants within the marine the relationship between dna single-strand breaks and the exposure of marine organisms to environmental contaminants was examined at sites in san diego a comprehensive assessment of the extent and consequences of marine environmental contamination in the area of naval station san diego was conducted in the summer of the study addressed contamination sediment-water biological and the biological effects portion of the study (this paper) included contaminant organismal and the determination of dna single-strand breaks using the comet dna damage was determined in hemocytes collected from deployed and resident mytilus at six stations in and around the naval station san deployed mussels were exposed on station for approximately 30 days in plastic mesh placed 1 m above the hemocyte samples were collected on days and it was found that stations exhibiting the extremes of contaminant both highest and lowest were easily identified using growth and dna damage sediment chemistry and bioaccumulation data and to be the most notable the comet and in particular germ cell dna damage were found to respond rapidly to station results from this study and an earlier 1993 study suggest that the non-sediment associated effects observed at one station may have been the result of the photoactivation of accumulated
influence of age and puberty on bone size and bone mineral content in healthy children and the biology of bone mineralization during growth is important for peak bone the aim of the study was to examine how body age and puberty influence bone size and bone mineral whole body bone area (ba) and bone mineral content (bmc) were examined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (hologic 1000/w) in healthy girls (n = 201) and boys (n = 142) aged 5-19 the influence of age and puberty on bone mineralization was examined by multiple main determinants of ba were height and bone approximated by ba corrected for increased highly significantly with weight and depended weakly significantly on pubertal main determinants of bmc were age and pubertal bone mineral approximated by bmc corrected for ba and depended on age and pubertal but not on thus skeletal size is mainly determined by body while bone density is determined by age and pubertal
a general module for rna crystallization of rna molecules other than simple oligonucleotide duplexes remains a challenging step in structure determination by x-ray subjecting covalently and conformationally homogeneous target molecules to an exhaustive array of crystallization conditions is often insufficient to yield crystals large enough for x-ray data even when large rna crystals are they often do not diffract x-rays to resolutions that would lead to biochemically informative we reasoned that a well-folded rna molecule would typically present a largely undifferentiated molecular surface dominated by the phosphate during crystal nucleation and this might result in neighboring molecules packing subtly out of leading to premature crystal growth cessation and to overcome this we have developed a crystallization module consisting of a normally intramolecular rna-rna interaction that is recruited to make an intermolecular crystal the target rna molecule is engineered to contain this module at sites that do not affect biochemical the presence of the crystallization module appears to drive crystal in the course of which non-designed contacts are we have employed the gaaa tetraloop/tetraloop receptor interaction successfully to crystallize numerous group ii intron domain 5-domain and hepatitis delta virus (hdv) ribozyme rna the use of the module allows facile growth of large making it practical to screen a large number of crystal forms for favorable diffraction the method has led to group ii intron domain crystals that diffract x-radiation to a
anaerobic regulation of bacillus subtilis krebs cycle krebs cycle enzyme activity in bacillus subtilis was examined under aerobic and anaerobic citrate synthase and aconitase activities in cells grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate were reduced by as much as 10- and from levels observed under aerobic culture the maximum level of isocitrate dehydrogenase activity during anaerobic growth was only twofold lower than that in aerobic these reductions in activity under conditions of anaerobiosis were found to be primarily the result of reduced krebs cycle gene this repression was not dependent on either the fnr or resde gene which have been shown to regulate expression of other subtilis genes in response to anaerobic catabolite control proteins ccpa and ccpb were not responsible for the a dyad symmetry element located between positions -73 and -59 relative to the transcription start site of the aconitase gene (citb) promoter was previously shown to be a target of catabolite repression and the binding site for a putative negative regulator during aerobic the deletion of the upstream arm of the dyad symmetry region abolished the citb repression observed during anaerobic neither citz or citb was repressed in an anaerobically grown citb an effect that was very likely the result of citrate these results suggest that catabolite repression and anaerobic repression of citz and citb are regulated by a common mechanism that does not involve or
a role for phospholipase d (pld1p) in and regulation of membrane lipid synthesis in the sec14 gene encodes a phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylcholine transfer protein essential for secretion and growth in yeast mutations and cpt1) in the cdp-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine synthesis suppress the sec14 growth defect permitting sec14(ts) sec14(ts) and sec14(ts) cpt1 strains to grow at the sec14(ts) restrictive we reported that these double mutant strains also excrete the phospholipid choline and inositol we now report that these choline and inositol excretion phenotypes are eliminated when the spo14 (pld1) gene encoding phospholipase d1 is in contrast to sec14(ts) cki1 sec14(ts) cki1 pld1 strains are not viable at the sec14(ts) restrictive temperature and exhibit a pattern of invertase secretion comparable with sec14(ts) the pld1 gene product appears to play an essential role in the suppression of the sec14(ts) defect by cdp-choline pathway indicating a role for phospholipase d1 in growth and sec14(ts) strains exhibit elevated phophatidylinositol phospholipase d we also propose that phospholipase d1-mediated phosphatidylcholine turnover generates a signal that activates transcription of the structural gene for inositol 1-phosphate
heregulin-dependent autocrine loop regulates growth of k-ras but not erbb-2 transformed rat thyroid epithelial the egf-like family of such as epidermal growth factor transforming growth factor alpha amphiregulin betacellulin cripto-1 and heregulin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several human carcinomas as autocrine growth differentiation and proliferation of rat thyroid cells in culture (frtl-5 cells) are regulated by thyrotropin withdrawal of tsh from culture medium produces growth whereas its addition to quiescent cells stimulates cell entry into s transformed thyroid cell lines as frtl-5h2 cell overexpressing kimol transformed by the wild-type k-ras and a6 transformed by a temperature sensitive k-ras can grow without addition of tsh to the culture in order to identify whether egf-like growth factors and corresponding receptors and erbb-4) could be involved in the autonomous growth of these transformed rat thyroid epithelial northern blot for mrna analysis and western blot for protein expression were in contrast to normal control frtl-5 both k-ras and erbb-2-transformed cells expressed elevated levels of erbb-2 both k-ras transformed kimol and a6 but no frtl-5h2 were found able to express also high levels of erbb-4 receptor and hrg/ndf treatment of k-ras transformed thyroid cells with neutralizing antibody against hrg/ndf reduced by 50% cell these data indicate that unlike the erbb-2 overexpressing frtl-5 in k-ras rat thyroid epithelial the growth factor heregulin signals through the heterodimer erbb-2/erbb-4 receptors in an autocrine
effect of maternal carbohydrate metabolism on fetal to determine the effect of maternal carbohydrate metabolism and anthropometric characteristics on fetal eight pregnant women in the third trimester with unexplained fetal growth restriction (fgr) and 11 women with normal pregnancies in the third trimester were evaluated for maternal carbohydrate using oral glucose tolerance tests and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic these data and maternal anthropometric characteristics subsequently were related to relative birth defined as observed birth weight x 100/50th percentile birth the women with fgr pregnancies were more insulin sensitive than were controls versus micromol/kg x p < and showed reduced insulin and glucose areas under the curve versus p < versus p < no differences were seen in fasting plasma insulin and human placental lactogen pregravid weight and in all maternal insulin sensitivity and weight gain correlated well with relative birth weight (r p < p < when the same analysis was computed separately in the insulin sensitivity exhibited a strong negative correlation with relative birth weight in the fgr group but not in controls p < in control women the best correlation between relative birth weight and the other variables studied was seen with maternal weight gain p < women with unexplained fgr have a different glucose metabolic pattern than do we speculate that increased insulin sensitivity leads to a reduction in metabolic substrates for fetal
deoxyspergualin preferentially inhibits the growth and maturation of anti-cd40-activated surface igd+ b deoxyspergualin an analogue of is a potent immunosuppressive drug with an action quite distinct from that of or in this study we investigated the effect of dsg and methyldeoxyspergualin (medsg) on the proliferation and differentiation of human b cells stimulated with anti-cd40 highly purified b cells obtained from tonsillar samples were used as target both agents inhibited the proliferative response of anti-cd40-stimulated b cells in the absence and presence of il-2 or il-10 in a dose-dependent this inhibitory effect differed markedly among cell populations based on surface igd strong inhibition of sigd+ b cells but little inhibition of sigd- b the drugs also suppressed the production of igm and iga by unfractionated b which suggests that dsg acts against post-switch (sigd-) b although the drugs suppressed immunoglobulin synthesis by both sigd+ and sigd- b the effect was more marked in the sigd+ b analysis of the subclass of igg secreted by sigd+ b cells revealed a decline in igg1 and igg3 in the presence of these results suggest that dsg preferentially inhibits the growth and maturation of sigd+ naive b
establishment of prostatic cell line from a p53-deficient we demonstrated that p53-deficiency is sufficient for immortalization of fetal uterine in the present we further extended our previous observations to prostate tissues from a young p53-deficient adult cell lines were established from the ventral prostate of a p53-deficient male mouse and maintained in medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum supplemented with insulin (10 transferrin (10 cholera toxin (10 and selenium (10(-8) one of the lines exhibits a typical epithelial morphology in despite the possession of androgen the growth of pro9ad was not stimulated by hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) slightly stimulated whereas fibroblast growth factor-1 keratinocyte growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor ab (pdgf-ab) had no stimulating effect on epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1 (igf-1) accelerated proliferation in a dose-dependent egf and igf-1 additively stimulated these results suggest that pro9ad shares characteristics in common with primary prostatic epithelial cells despite and that p53-deficiency alone allows establishment of clonal cell lines of the prostate the prostates of p53-deficient mice are useful sources for obtaining cell
cryopreservation and culture of human corneal to assess the effects of two different concentrations of albumin in a cryoprotective solution and two freezing methods on human corneal keratocyte isolated keratocytes were used for solutions of 10% dimethylsulfoxide with either 2% or 10% human albumin were used as cryoprotective cells either were transferred directly into a -80 degrees c freezer (freezing 2 degrees c/min) or were cooled in a programmed freezer (1 degrees c/min until -40 degrees c and then 10 degrees which resulted in four different cryopreservation cells were stored at -80 degrees then were thawed at 37 degrees and subsequently were keratocytes were studied by means of trypan blue growth apoptosis transmission electron and the percentage of cells that were alive after thawing ranged from 80% to 99% by trypan blue staining and from 45% to 60% by flow the ratio of the number of living cells at the end of primary culture after cryopreservation to that before cryopreservation was significantly higher after direct transfer into the -80 degrees c freezer than after controlled-rate whereas the albumin concentration had no significant influence on this ratio the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly higher after cryopreservation than in the control group of noncryopreserved more than 5% 24 hours after cryopreservation did not modify the keratocyte fibroblast growth factor dramatically decreased the serum-induced cell expression of alpha smooth muscle whereas cryopreservation had no influence on this cell a freeze-thaw which was related to cryopreservation-induced cell was revealed during primary culture after direct transfer into the -80 degrees c freezer resulted in better postcryopreservation growth in the culture than controlled-rate a change in albumin concentration from 2% to 10% did not affect the
mutual interactions between p53 and growth factors in the function of p53 tumour suppressor protein is determined by various intrinsic properties of the the effect of p53 and protein-protein interactions are determined by the conformation of the p53 fulfils its role in cell cycle control and the onset of apoptotic cell which is altered when the wild-type p53 (wt-p53) conformation is changed due to this review focuses on the communal interactions of wt- and mutant p53 (m-p53) with growth factors and shows that m-p53 affects different cell biological functions that determine the malignant behaviour of for affects the response of cells to growth factors and growth p53 is involved in the expression of several growth factor- and growth factor receptor these data suggest that restoration of the wt-p53 phenotype in tumour cells with m-53 might not only affect cell cycle control and apoptotic mechanisms but could also reduce autocrine growth and restore sensitivity to physiological growth
biology of somatotropin in growth and lactation of domestic impressive progress has been made during the past 15 years in our understanding of the biology of somatotropin (st) in domestic in this progress was sparked by advances in biotechnology that made feasible the production of large quantities of recombinant bovine st (bst) and porcine st the availability of recombinant bst and pst resulted in an exponential increase in investigations that explored their role in growth and lactation as well as evaluated their potential for commercial these studies established that administration of bst to lactating dairy cows increased milk and treatment of growing pigs with pst markedly stimulated muscle growth and reduced fat in addition to these a substantial number of investigations examined the mechanisms by which st affects lactation and growth of domestic this review summarizes the diverse physiological effects st has on growth and lactation and discusses the underlying mechanisms that mediate these effects in domestic
