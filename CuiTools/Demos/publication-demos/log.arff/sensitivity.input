the inseparable analytical measurement and quantitative resolution [comment] [see the formal definition of sensitivity associates the term with the change in the response of a system for a small change of the stimulus causing the the ratio of the response of a system to the stimulus causing one interpretation of sensitivity associates the rate of change of the response for a small change of the stimulus as the slope of a calibration plot of response vs an alternative interpretation associates sensitivity with the smallest value of the stimulus that can be resolved with a given degree of the detection applications of the first usage to analytical chemistry date at least to the beginning of this applications of the second interpretation are of more recent the accompanying paper argues in favor of the second interpretation on the basis among other the interpretation conflicts with the formal definition of sensitivity and is meaningless as a descriptor of the performance of a measuring in this paper i offer arguments to support my belief that the slope definition of sensitivity is consistent with both formal definitions and accepted usage in analytical chemistry more that it is an invaluable descriptor of one of the most important characteristics of any analytical i include information to support my belief that proper use of the slope definition yields much more information than is available in the

[diagnosis of anterior knee comparison between the lachman the arthrometer and the ultrasound lachman we reviewed 45 patients on average years after surgery for rupture of the anterior cruciate the aim of the study was to compare the reliability of the lachman test to evaluation of knee laxity with the kt 1000 arthrometer and the ultrasound-assisted lachman forty-five knees were examined with the lachman 12 knees showed no sign of 20 had a + positive lachman test with a hard end 6 with a + positive test had no end point and were rated as a +2 lachman test was found in 7 with the kt 1000 arthrometer 44 knees were 30 knees were graded as stable according to the criteria of 14 knees were we used the ultrasound-guided lachman test in 44 taking only the side-to-side difference into 37 knees were stable and 7 according to a single translation greater than 4 mm is also a sign of 12 knees were although 6 of these knees were rated as taking the side-to-side difference into comparing the two instrument all knees with ultrasound-rated instability on the basis of side-to-side measurements were also rated as unstable with the kt 1000 only half of the knees rated as unstable because of a single translation greater than 4 mm with the ultrasound technique were rated as unstable with the kt 1000 our results show that the accuracy of the lachman test is as good as the instrument evaluation if the end point is taken into a positive lachman test indicating anterior knee laxity is one where the soft end point is as described by torg et both instrument measurements are accurate in indicating anterior knee but only if they are used by an experienced using the side-to-side the sensitivity of the kt 1000 arthrometer is if only single translations greater than 4 mm without a significant side-to-side difference with the ultrasound technique are interpreted as anterior knee then some knees will be rated as although both the clinical and kt 1000 arthrometer examinations prove them to be we believe that only a side-to-side difference with the instrument techniques should be interpreted as knee borderline positive measurements should only be used together with the clinical both instrument measurements can help to improve the quality of the clinical examination if the examiners are if instrument measurements are we believe that the ultrasound technique is easy and cheap to we believe that instrument measurements of anterior knee laxity are not necessary if a thorough clinical examination is taking the end point of the lachman test into
the sensitivity of rapid (partial) review of cervical rapid review involves a daily rapid 30 s) review of all smears not normally it has been suggested that the method may increase the sensitivity of cervical cytology by identifying abnormalities not reported on initial true false negatives rapid screening is reported to have high sensitivity for cervical neoplasia when used as a preview to be in a review mode it must be able to detect several studies have found that many tfn result from factors such as low numbers of abnormal cells or subtle expression of diagnostic studies on the sensitivity of rapid screening for detecting tfn would therefore provide a more reliable estimate of its value as a review the sensitivity of rapid re-screening was evaluated using a test set of 200 each of 15 screeners rapidly reviewed (30 s partial screen) the set over a 2-week the set consisted of 129 28 low-grade squamous lesions (cin 37 high-grade lesions (cin iii and adenocarcinoma in situ (ais)) and six invasive the abnormals included 20 tfn the median sensitivity for abnormalities was rapid review was more sensitive for cin ii and cin iii (67%) and invasive carcinoma than for cin i great variation was apparent in the sensitivity for individual with a range of 41-86% for all the sensitivity for tfn cases varied even more median 35%) and for most screeners was significantly (p < lower than for cases which were detected on initial screen median following this trial rapid review was used routinely for a period of 3 in this time cases were rapidly this led to the full review of 415 slides and the identification of 16 cases of undetected cin (12 cin three cin one cin based on current estimates of our laboratory false-negative rate this represents between a quarter and half of the tfn cases of cin that probably occurred in this in rapid screening is likely to be significantly less sensitive when used in a review rather than a preview in routine practice the method requires a daily commitment of screener but does provide a higher yield of tfn smears than does random and allows amendment of these results prior to
[tumor bladder antigen a new method for the diagnosis and detection of recurrence of bladder to compare the usefulness and accuracy of the bta test versus urinary the bta test was performed in 45 patients distributed into three group i comprised patients with hematuria of unknown group ii had a diagnosis of bladder and group iii comprised patients who had undergone tur for a bladder tumor and were undergoing endoscopic control the sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic method were determined for each group of the bta test showed a higher sensitivity than urinary cytology in all the difference being significant for groups ii and its was lower than that of cytology in groups i and and similar in group the bta test is a simple and useful method for the diagnosis and follow-up of bladder it has a higher sensitivity than urinary although its specificity is lower due to the higher number of false positives observed in patients with inflammatory bladder randomized studies are warranted to determine if the accuracy of urinary cytology can be enhanced with the combined use of the bta test which has been demonstrated to have a higher
anxiety multiple dimensions and hierarchic anxiety sensitivity (as) is the fear of anxiety-related based on beliefs that these sensations have harmful as is thought to play an important role as a diathesis for anxiety particularly panic recent evidence suggests that as has a hierarchical consisting of multiple lower-order which load on a single higher-order if each factor corresponds to a discrete then the results suggest that as arises from a hierarchic arrangement of a problem with previous studies is that they were based on the 16-item anxiety sensitivity index which may not contain enough items to reveal the type and number of lower-order we developed the 60-item anxiety sensitivity which was administered to 349 university factor analyses revealed four lower-order (1) fear of respiratory (2) fear of cognitive (3) fear of gastrointestinal and (4) fear of cardiac these loaded on a single higher-order the lower-order factors shared variance with the higher-order but also contained unique the results suggest that as is the product of a general with independent contributions from four specific
