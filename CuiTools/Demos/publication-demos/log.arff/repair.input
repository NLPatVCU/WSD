[cicatrization of complete traumatic lesions of the posterior cruciate magnetic resonance follow-up of 10 cases and a proposal for modification of gross traumatic injuries of the knee ligaments present in various degrees of severity from interstitial sprains to complete ligament the femoral insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament (acl) is susceptible to post-traumatic ischemic changes secondary to interrupted vascular supply from the tibial in the posterior cruciate ligament (pcl) has more extensive vascularization from the posterior geniculate which allows better healing of these injuries with fibrous scar mri of a scarred pcl injury shows lower than normal signal which post-traumatic changes in signal intensity are well described in the in my personal experience with more than 5500 mr examinations of the pcl traumatic injuries secondary to motor vehicle accidents or sports injuries are a frequent many of these patients are completely asymptomatic for articular material and from to a direct mr follow-up was proposed to patients with pcl traumatic only the patients examined in our hospital were included in this study because the mr scans were performed using the same slice thickness and twenty patients had acute traumatic injuries of the four were not examined because of an additional traumatic episode and four were not included because they were operated ten patients were thus three women and seven men whose age ranged 23 to 41 years mr follow-up ranged 9 to 36 months at the first mr pcl tears were classified as gross class ii (1 patient) and gross class iii (9 follow-up mri showed no pcl in 2 patients (similar to ischemic degeneration in complete acl focal interligament changes within a continuous pcl in 2 patients and normal pcl in 6 the trauma was caused by a motor vehicle accident with the knee flexed in 8 patients and during hyperflexion in sports activity (skiing or soccer) in 2 five patients presented with knee instability and subjective such as pain and difficulty in climbing or performing sports follow-up mri showed natural repair of the pcl traumatic injury in 5 with absolutely no knee even though the number of patients in this study is follow-up mri confirms the possibility of scar tissue repair in pcl post-traumatic supporting primary conservative
modern surgical treatment of anal new surgical treatment modalities have been developed for patients with anal incontinence resulting from extensive sphincter destruction and in whom standard sphincter repair has these new modalities include the transposition of striated skeletal muscles combined with implantation of artificial sphincters based on the same principle as artificial urinary and direct sacral nerve in a few reported series muscle transposition in combination with neurostimulation has given a satisfactory continence in 50-70% of the the same is true for the smaller series published on artificial anal whereas the results of sacral nerve stimulation have thus far been reported in only a few the selection of patients and the performance of these procedures should be limited to few specialist
repair of the mitral valve because of pure rheumatic mitral valvar incompetence in the between january 1985 and april 42 children aged between 7 and 14 years (mean years) underwent repair of severely incompetent rheumatic mitral valves with no accompanying mitral in 19 patients the tricuspid valve was severely while 8 patients had severe aortic the repair incorporated shortening of elongated tendinous cords and insertion of a duran or carpentier prosthetic the repair was the sole procedure in 15 whilst 19 patients also had a de vega tricuspid valvar annuloplasty and 8 had repair or replacement of the aortic there were no hospital postoperative transthoracic echocardiographic studies revealed trivial residual mitral valvar regurgitation in 6 mild regurgitation in moderate in and regurgitation severe enough to warrant replacement of the mitral valve in 3 the mean follow-up period was 37 months (maximum 120 minimum 1 of 39 patients 28 attended for more than 5 of 7 underwent replacement of the mitral valve for severe regurgitation within 4 years of the severe mitral regurgitation in 3 patients was controlled by medical one was eventually lost to and one patient died of causes unrelated to the remaining 16 patients had absent to moderate mitral valvar these results contrast with 10 repairs of congenital mitral where no patients required re-operation in the immediate 5 years period of every effort should be made in children with rheumatic mitral incompetence to preserve the natural valve by conservative despite the fact that repair of the incompetent rheumatic mitral valve is not so durable as repair of congenitally incompetent
repair of congenital tricuspid valve abnormalities with artificial chordae congenital abnormalities of the tricuspid including and those found in pulmonary atresia with intact septum and congenitally corrected are an uncommon cause of tricuspid congenital tricuspid valve anomalies are found as a spectrum of disease in which both the leaflets and the subvalvar apparatus are often tricuspid valve repair is complicated in such patients because the chordae tendineae are often abnormally short and replacement or augmentation of chordae tendineae has proved to be a useful component of mitral valve in the present we describe the techniques and results of chordal augmentation in the repair of congenital tricuspid valve since july tricuspid valve repair has been performed in 5 children with severe tricuspid regurgitation secondary to congenital abnormalities of the tricuspid valve with significant chordal as a component of the chordal replacement or augmentation was performed using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene intraoperative and postoperative echocardiographic assessment showed good mobility of the tricuspid valve leaflets and trivial to mild tricuspid there were no complications and no early or late at follow-up of 34 to 60 months 49 tricuspid valve function has remained excellent in 4 of the 5 in the remaining progressive regurgitation of the right ventricle to pulmonary artery allograft conduit has led to right ventricular with a secondary increase in tricuspid regurgitation from trivial to chordal replacement or augmentation with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene suture is a useful technique in the repair of congenitally dysplastic tricuspid valves with abnormal chordal
closure of wide patent ductus arteriosus with cardiopulmonary bypass and balloon occlusion [see the short patent ductus arteriosus in adults and older adolescents poses an extreme hazard with standard closed ligation the method of transpulmonary balloon catheter occlusion and repair of pediatric ductus arteriosus is herein reported in older patients using a foley catheter and normothermic transesophageal echocardiography is crucial in assessing the size of the ductus and confirming adequacy of the technique is simple and safe even in the presence of a short
transforming growth factor-beta receptor expression on human skin dimeric complex formation of type i and type ii receptors and identification of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored transforming growth factor-beta binding fibroblasts play a critical role in wound repair and in the development of fibrotic and transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta) has been shown to profoundly modulate fibroblast there is limited information on the tgf-beta receptor isoform and complex formation in skin we report that normal adult human skin fibroblasts display two cell surface glycosyl phosphatidylinositol tgf-beta binding proteins in addition to the type and iii tgf-beta the identities of these proteins are confirmed on the basis of their affinity for tgf-beta immunoprecipitation with specific antireceptor and other biochemical immunoprecipitation results also indicated oligomeric complex formation between type i and ii and between type ii and iii tgf-beta by using affinity labeling and two-dimensional we demonstrate the occurrence of type i and ii heterodimers and type i homodimers of tgf-beta receptors on these because the type i receptor does not bind tgf-beta in the absence of type ii these results indicate that one molecule of tgf-beta induces the formation of a heterooligomeric complex containing more than one molecule each of type i and ii tgf-beta receptors on these these cells respond to tgf-beta by markedly down-regulating all five binding proteins and by potently augmenting dna these results allow the expansion of the proposed heteromeric tgf-beta receptor signaling paradigm using mutant cells that are unresponsive to tgf-beta and cell lines that have been transfected to overexpress these to include normal tgf-beta-responsive in the definition of tgf-beta receptor profiles in human skin fibroblasts provides important information for studying their alterations in these cells in various skin
posthysterectomy vaginal vault primary repair in 693 to examine the results of primary repair of posthysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse in a large series of patients with long-term from january 1976 to december 693 patients underwent primary repair of vault prolapse at the mayo the mayo culdoplasty technique was used in 95% of these patients were followed up by reference to their mayo clinic medical a specifically designed and pelvic examination in a subgroup of the median age at operation was 66 abdominal hysterectomy had been performed on of patients and vaginal hysterectomy on (hysterectomy type was not documented on the median number of years to vault prolapse repair after hysterectomy was (range information about prolapse after primary repair was available for 504 patients and 80 had evidence or complaint protrusion) of recurrent thirty-six of 693 patients had subsequent prolapse eighty-two percent of patients indicated satisfaction with the complications of operation included entry into the bladder or rectum of vault hematoma cuff infection and ureteral complications the number of patients presenting for vault prolapse repair increased during the study the mayo culdoplasty can be performed with minimal it achieved an anatomic restoration of upper vaginal support in a high percentage of patients with long-term
the effects of soft-tissue expansion on lip repair and midfacial growth in a rabbit cleft lip midfacial hypoplasia following primary cleft lip repair is a common clinical recent experimental work has suggested that increased lip pressure following an undermined lip repair may contribute to midfacial growth soft-tissue expansion has been used to generate additional soft tissue for reconstruction in the cranial the use of this technique in the labial region may allow lip repair to be performed with less tension (pressure) and thus facilitate midfacial to test this 40 4-week-old rabbits were randomly divided into four two groups had surgically created lip and alveolar ipsilateral labial tissue expanders were placed in all four one cleft and one normal group underwent the other two groups served as a the expanders were removed at 4 and an undermined lip repair was performed in both cleft findings revealed that soft-tissue expansion increased labial surface area significantly by approximately 96% (p < labial soft-tissue expansion alone had no effect on midfacial growth during the observation in cleft animals undergoing tissue expansion exhibited significantly reduced (p < postoperative lip pressure and increased midfacial growth compared with cleft animals without expansion through 36 weeks of results suggest that preoperative tissue expansion reduced postoperative lip pressure and improved midfacial growth in a rabbit cleft lip
persistent collateral perfusion of abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular repair does not lead to progressive change in aneurysm to differentiate between the phenomenon of collateral perfusion from a side branch versus graft-related endoleaks after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms with respect to aneurysm size and we successfully treated 64 aaa patients with endovascular we followed all the patients postoperatively with spiral computed tomography at six and 12 and biannually we measured aneurysm diameters preoperatively and we calculated preoperatively the relation of maximum aortic diameter (d) to the thrombus-free lumen diameter (l) expressed as an l/d median follow-up was 15 sixteen patients had collateral perfusion during we successfully treated two patients with one patient showed resolution of collateral perfusion after we stopped warfarin two patients died of unrelated causes during one patient was converted to surgical and two patients showed spontaneous resolution of their collateral the group of patients with perfusion showed no statistically significant change of their aortic diameter on the group of patients without perfusion showed a median decrease in aortic diameter of 8mm (p < at 18 months the group of patients with perfusion had significantly less thrombus in their aneurysm sac preoperatively than the group without as expressed by the l/d ratio (mean l/d versus there was no significant increase in aortic diameter on an average 18 months postoperatively despite persistent collateral this may indicate a halted disease progression in the short embolization of collateral vessels is associated with risk of we recommend a conservative approach with close observation if aneurysm diameter is
modified subclavian flap aortoplasty for coarctation repair in patients less than three months of subclavian flap aortoplasty is one of the best procedures for coarctation but recoarctation still remains a problem in neonates and we employed subclavian flap aortoplasty with resection of the whole layer of aortic ductal tissue in 9 patients less than 3 months of age with coarctation of the aorta and obtained satisfactory
