flight-muscle polymorphism in the cricket gryllus muscle characteristics and their influence on the evolution of flight muscles of the cricket gryllus firmus are existing as pink or white white muscles are smaller in have reduced number and size of muscle and have reduced in vitro enzyme activities and respiration rates relative to pink muscles of newly fully winged firmus is also polymorphic for wing all newly molted long-winged adults exhibited the pink-muscle while most newly molted short-winged adults exhibited the white-muscle which resulted from arrested muscle as long-winged adults fully grown pink muscle was transformed into white muscle via the substantially higher respiration rate of pink muscle likely contributes to the elevated whole-organism respiration rate of long-winged which has been documented previously and which is thought to divert nutrients from egg histolyzed white flight muscle from long-winged crickets also exhibited significantly elevated respiration rate and enzyme activities compared with underdeveloped white muscle from short-winged although these differences were not as great as those between pink and white fecundity was much more elevated in females with white verus pink flight muscles than it was in females with short versus long the fitness gain resulting from flightlessness has typically been estimated in previous studies by comparing enhanced egg production of short-winged and long-winged without considering the influence of flight-muscle our results suggest that the magnitude of this fitness gain has been substantially

re-feeding after starvation involves a temporal shift in the control site of glycogen synthesis in rat the starved-to-fed transition is accompanied by rapid glycogen deposition in skeletal on the basis of recent findings palmer and fournier (1997) 303-308] that during recovery from exercise there is a shift from a glucose 6-phosphate/phosphorylation-based control of glycogen synthesis to a phosphorylation-based control this paper seeks to establish whether a similar shift occurs in muscle during re-feeding after starvation in the chow re-feeding after 48 h of starvation resulted in glycogen deposition in all muscles examined red and mixed soleus and diaphragm) to levels higher than those in the fed although the early phase of re-feeding was associated with increases in glucose 6-phosphate levels in all there was no accompanying increase in the fractional velocity of glycogen synthase except in the white quadriceps this together with the observation that the fractional velocity of glycogen synthase in most muscles was already high in the starved suggests that in the initial phase of glycogen deposition the phosphorylation state of the enzyme may be adequate to support net glycogen in the later phase of the progressive decrease in the fractional velocity of glycogen synthase in association with a decrease in the rate of glycogen deposition suggests that glycogen synthesis is controlled primarily by changes in the phosphorylation state of glycogen in this study suggests that there is a temporal shift in the site of control of glycogen synthesis as glycogen deposition progresses during re-feeding after
co-refolding denatured-reduced hen egg white lysozyme with acidic and basic refolding of denatured-reduced lysozyme and the effect of co-refolding it with other proteins such as rnase bovine serum myelin basic alcohol dehydrogenase and dnase i on the renaturation yield and the aggregation of lysozyme have been basic proteins consistently increase the renaturation yield of the basic protein lysozyme (10-20% more than in their absence) with little or no on the other co-refolding of lysozyme with acidic proteins leads to aggregation and a significant decrease in renaturation our results show that hetero-interchain interactions (non-specific interactions) occur when the basic protein lysozyme is refolded together with acidic proteins such as bovine serum alcohol dehydrogenase or dnase our results also suggest that the net charge on proteins plays a significant role in such non-specific these results should prove useful in understanding the hetero-interchain interactions between folding polypeptide

secular trends in the united states black/white hypertension prevalence potential impact of diminishing response in this integrative the authors analyzed 25 studies on hypertension prevalence among black and white adults the authors made the following 1) both female and male black/white hypertension prevalence ratios have diminished by approximately a third over the past three 2) response rates were significantly lower among the more recent surveys 1976 or mean percent (standard deviation (sd) 1960 to mean percent (sd and 3) these two trends are directly associated--response rates may account for a third r2 = to nearly a half r2 = of the variability in black-white hypertension these findings suggest that although respondent-based research has found black and white adults in the united states to be increasingly similar in hypertension the same may not be true of the entire adult population (responders and the apparent diminishment over time in the black-white hypertension gap is as likely to be a methodological artifact allied with declining response rates as a true parametric phenomenon resultant from substantive factors such as enhanced treatment effectiveness among

uncoupling of immune complex formation and kidney damage in autoimmune the generation of autoantibody and subsequent tissue deposition of immune complexes (ic) is thought to trigger the pathogenic consequences of systemic autoimmune modulation of the autoantibody response disrupts pathogenesis by preventing the formation of uncoupling ic formation from subsequent inflammatory responses seems unlikely because of the apparent complexity of the ic-triggered inflammatory the disruption of a single which encodes the gamma chain of the fc was found to achieve this uncoupling in a spontaneous model of lupus the new zealand black/new zealand white (nzb/nzw) gamma chain-deficient nzb/nzw mice generated and deposited ic and activated but were protected from severe thus defining another potential pathway for therapeutic intervention in autoimmune
stearoyl-coa desaturase activity in adipose tissues and liver of growing large white and meishan stearoyl-coa desaturase activity was measured in adipose tissue (backfat and neckfat) and liver microsomes of large white and meishan preliminary assays have shown that delta 9-desaturase activity cannot be measured on frozen because freezing involves a loss in activity of the specific activity of liver delta 9-desaturase was much lower than that of the adipose tissues in both indicating that the liver is not a major site of oleate synthesis in the the hepatic delta 9-desaturase activity was higher in meishan than in large white delta 9-desaturase activity in the adipose tissue of large white pigs was much higher than that of meishan even though the percentage of oleate was slightly higher in the adipose tissues of the this investigation has demonstrated that differences in fatty acid composition of adipose tissues between large white and meishan pigs cannot be attributed to differences in delta 9-desaturase activity at this stage of these results suggest that the higher oleate percentage in meishan adipose tissues would result from a higher delta 9-desaturase activity at an earlier
a secondary analysis of smoking among rural and urban youth using the mtf data this paper compares rural and urban youth cigarette-smoking behavior using the monitoring the future data a multi-stage sample cigarette smoking was examined by and gender over results indicated that rural white males smoked more often (30-day prevalence of 34%) than any other urban black males smoked the least urban white females smoked more (30-day prevalence of 33%) than urban black females in rural and urban whites reported smoking at significantly higher rates than rural and urban smoking rates declined steadily for both rural and urban black females and urban black males over the study these data document distinctive patterns of tobacco use among the which can be used by program planners for specific targeted

the post-larval development of lateral musculature in gilthead sea bream sparus aurata and sea bass dicentrarchus labrax fibre-type differentiation of lateral musculature has been studied in gilthead sea bream sparus aurata and sea bass dicentrarchus labrax during post-larval development using histochemical and morphometric the study showed three muscle intermediate (or pink) and most of the red muscle showed low myosin atpase (m-atpase) activity whereas near the transverse septum some small high m-atpase activity fibres appeared and later acquired a rosette during adult growth the red muscle showed a histochemical mosaic the pink muscle in sea bass was observed at the beginning of juvenile development by the oxidative technique (nadh-rt reaction) whereas in gilthead sea bream it was also observed at the end of larval the pink layer consists of high m-atpase activity along the muscle development other low and moderate m-atpase activity fibres were observed close to the red and white the white muscle of juvenile fish showed a histochemical mosaic appearance near the pink in adult specimens the mosaic white muscle spread out occupying the whole of the morphometric analysis shows a significant increase in mean fibre diameter during post-larval as shown by the t-test (hypertrophic skewness and kurtosis values of fibre diameters point to the generation of a new fibres from the myosatellite cells (hyperplastic
spatial scale and saccade the global effect in eye orienting occurs when saccades land at the of of a target stimulus short-latency saccades are particularly prone to this effect whereas longer-latency saccades may show more influence of fine alternative explanations of these effects are considered and data are presented from an experiment in which the influence of different stimulus features on the global effect in a search task was the effect shows a substantially different time course for target-distractor combinations differing in contrast polarity (black vs white) than for combinations differing in shape (circle vs it is concluded that the global effect cannot be explained either as a high-level strategic effect or as an effect of automatic fast processing of low-spatial-frequency information in early sensory instead it is suggested that the visual-spatial-integration characteristic of the global effect is an integral and unavoidable part of the process of selection of saccadic
body weight change and carotid artery wall the atherosclerosis risk in communities (aric) the impact of weight change in adulthood on cardiovascular disease is this study examined the association of change in body from young adulthood to middle with average carotid artery intimal-medial wall thickness by b-mode ultrasound measured in middle participants were men and women aged 45-64 years from the baseline examination of the atherosclerosis risk in communities (aric) study weight change was calculated as the difference between weight at the baseline examination and self-reported weight at age white men gained a mean of black white and black weight change was albeit associated with intimal-medial thickness in black men and white men and in white but not in black adjusted for examination sports activity and body mass index at age the differences in intimal-medial thickness associated with a 10-kg increment in weight change were (95% confidence interval to mm in white (95% confidence interval to mm in black (95% confidence interval to mm in white and (95% confidence interval to mm in black these findings support the hypothesis that weight gain in adulthood promotes atherosclerotic changes in white men and women and in black
brown fat is essential for cold-induced thermogenesis but not for obesity resistance in ap2-ucp the role of brown adipose tissue in total energy balance and cold-induced thermogenesis was mice expressing mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (ucp-1) from the fat-specific ap2 gene promoter (heterozygous and homozygous ap2-ucp transgenic mice) and their nontransgenic c57bl6/j littermates were the transgenic animals are resistant to obesity induced by a high-fat presumably due to ectopic synthesis of ucp-1 in white these animals exhibited atrophy of brown adipose as indicated by smaller size of brown fat and reduction of its total ucp-1 and dna norepinephrine-induced respiration (measured in pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized animals) was decreased proportionally to the dosage of the and the homozygous (but not heterozygous) transgenic mice exhibited a reduction in their capacity to maintain body temperature in the our results indicate that the role of brown fat in cold-induced thermogenesis cannot be substituted by increased energy expenditure in other

an investigation into the use of thermorheology and texture analysis in the evaluation of w/o creams stabilized with a silicone the aim of the study was to evaluate a range of w/o semisolid emulsion systems (creams) containing white soft paraffin (petrolatum) and a new type of nonionic lipophilic silicone emulsifier (abil em 90) using a novel combination of rheological emulsifier concentrations from to w/w were used with two manufacturing cold (25 degrees c) and warm (70 degrees c) to determine whether and to what extent these variables alter the structure and consistency of the the techniques comprised linear (continuous flow) and dynamic (oscillatory) rheometry at 25 degrees thermal flow experiments (from 10 degrees to 90 degrees c and back to 10 degrees and penetrometry the differences in emulsifier concentration produced effects on the rheological properties of the w/ o although the manufacturing process was much more cold emulsification led to creams with higher lower and better elastic the results of penetration tests on creams correlated with those of the rheological the flow properties of white soft paraffin at 25 degrees c were comparable with the creams obtained by cold while the elasticity was considerably thermorheological studies showed evidence for transitional behavior for white soft paraffin on but not for the white soft paraffin showed a higher viscosity (and resistance to the penetrating force) when melted at 70 degrees c and left to solidify at room compared to the this was the opposite trend to that found with warm and cold emulsified the input of heat during the emulsification process showed a strong effect on the structure and consistency of the w/o creams containing petrolatum and silicone resulting in a less viscous the use of the aforementioned techniques represents a useful and novel approach to the evaluation of cream
paratubal cysts in young females as an incidental finding in laparotomies performed for right lower quadrant abdominal paratubal cysts represent remnants of the paramesonephric or mesonephric the former being more most of them are but they may rarely give rise to clinical problems due to enlargement or in this we looked for paratubal cysts or other pathological lesions of the right uterine adnexa in young females operated upon for right lower quadrant (rlq) abdominal our material consisted of 338 white female patients aged 4-14 laparotomy revealed only acute appendicitis in 283 while 44 had acute appendicitis plus a coincidental paratubal most of these cysts were smaller than 1 cm in 2 additional cases had torsion of a large paratubal while 5 had a ruptured corpus we suggest that a thorough search of the right adnexa for the presence of paratubal cysts during laparotomies performed for rlq pain is a useful this approach also allows detection of other pathological lesions of the right adnexa that often produce symptoms similar to acute
discordance between ultrasound of the calcaneus and bone mineral density in black and white black women have 40% of the incidence rate for hip fracture and have a higher bone mineral density (bmd) than white the possibility was raised that bone quality may be disproportionately greater than the advantage in bone density in protection against osteoporotic fractures in black versus white ultrasound (us) of the calcaneus is believed to measure properties of bone in addition to its we performed bone density measurements and us of the calcaneus in 108 black and 177 healthy white aged 20-70 the highest correlation was seen between total body bone density and speed of sound (r = the interracial differences in bmd were all statistically significant and varied from to the us measurements had lesser interracial differences than the bone density with velocity barely different between these findings suggest that us of the calcaneus measures properties of bone different from fracture prediction data using us from prospective data in white women should not be extrapolated to black women because of the discordance between bone density and us prospective studies are needed comparing us measurements in black women to the occurrence of osteoporotic
an in vitro comparison between laser fluorescence and visual examination for detection of demineralization in occlusal pits and it has been demonstrated that when excited by laser light carious enamel appears dark compared to luminescent sound the aim of this study was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of visual exams laser fluorescence (lf) and dye-enhanced lf (delf) for detecting demineralization in occlusal pits and the actual presence of lesions was determined by subsequent confocal laser microscopy which was compared to histology independent clinical examiners visually graded three sites on occlusal surfaces of human premolars as sound or carious and also rated the color of each graded site 0 = same as surrounding 1 = 2 = light or 3 = brown/dark an argon laser was used to illuminate the teeth for lf and the images were captured with a ccd camera and then delf images were captured after the teeth had been exposed to sodium sections were then cut from each specimen and analyzed by cm and h for the presence or absence of results showed that delf was significantly more sensitive than lf and v for detecting but there were no significant differences among the methods in specificity (v lf delf when color was used as an indication of caries in v sensitivity specificity v exams were not different from the area under the roc using h as the gold standard and cm as the was results indicated that delf was the best diagnostic tool and that vc and lf were equally effective as diagnostic when color of fissures was included as an indication of demineralization in the visual
bacterial vaginosis and preterm a comprehensive review of the preterm low birth weight is the major determinant of infant morbidity and numerous studies have linked bacterial vaginosis (bv) with preterm birth and low birth weight especially among black this article reviews the published literature to provide clear evidence that bv is an independent risk factor for preterm birth and pregnant black women are especially at having nearly three times the level of bv as pregnant white compounding the problem is the fact that half the population of women with bv are and current standard antenatal procedures do not provide for screening for by reviewing bv treatment this article also provides evidence that treatment for bv is effective and that the identification and treatment of bv in pregnant women can lead to substantial reduction in the high rates of preterm birth and

black-white differences in hip study of osteoporotic fractures research previous studies have demonstrated that reduced thickness of the femoral neck and shaft a wider intertrochanteric region and a longer hip axis length were predictive of hip fracture among caucasian we hypothesized that racial differences in these features of hip geometry may contribute to explaining the differences in hip fracture incidence between women of african origin and caucasian we measured the cortical thickness and bone widths in 132 african-american women and 43 nigerian women who were pair-matched on height (+/- 3 age (+/- 5 years) and weight (+/- 3 kg) to 175 caucasian measures of cortical thickness were greater among women of african origin than women of african origin had smaller bone widths and a shorter hip axis length than several of these differences were independent of bone mineral density except for the cortical thickness of the femoral we conclude that women of african origin have thicker cortical bone of the a shorter hip axis length and smaller intertrochanteric widths than based on a model developed from hip fractures among caucasian we predict that these observed racial differences could contribute to approximately a 25% decrease risk of hip fracture among

faecal bile acid and sterol concentrations in premenopausal indian and white vegetarians compared with white faecal water the concentrations of neutral sterols and bile acids and dietary intakes were measured in twenty-two indian twenty-two white omnivorous and eighteen white vegetarian premenopausal faecal bulk and water content were greater and ph lower in the indian total faecal animal sterol and coprostanol concentrations expressed on a dry-weight basis were lower in the vegetarians compared with the the faecal sterol concentrations were correlated with dietary cholesterol primary bile acids were detected in six indian two white vegetarians and two white secondary bile acids were detected in all the white omnivores and vegetarian subjects but not in two of the indian total faecal free bile acid and conjugated bile acid concentrations were lower in the white vegetarians compared with the faecal lithocholic acid concentrations were lower in both indian and white the deoxycholic acid ratio and total animal sterols ratio were significantly lower in the indian vegetarians compared with the both ratios were positively correlated with faecal stepwise multiple regression analyses were undertaken in order to identify which nutrients influenced faecal lithocholic and deoxycholic acid the intakes of starch and dietary fibre were negatively associated with faecal concentrations of lithocholic and deoxycholic starch intake alone was negatively associated with faecal the results of this study confirm that diets high in dietary fibre decrease faecal bile acid concentrations and suggest that the complex carbohydrates present in indian vegetarian diets influence faecal ph and inhibit the degradation of faecal
