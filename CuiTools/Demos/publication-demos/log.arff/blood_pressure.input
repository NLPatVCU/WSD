enhancement of the vasodepressor response to adenosine by nicorandil in comparison with the effect of nicorandil on systemic blood pressure (sbp) and heart rate (hr) responses to adenosine was compared with that of an adenosine triphosphate (atp)-sensitive k+ channel in anesthetized intravenous adenosine in doses of 1-100 micrograms/kg elicited dose-dependent decreases in accompanied by decreases in potentiation of adenosine action by infusion of either nicorandil (10 or 30 micrograms/kg per min) or cromakalim microgram/kg per min) occurred in all of the animals after treatment with glibenclamide (20 an atp-sensitive k+ channel not only adenosine action but also the enhancement of adenosine action by nicorandil and cromakalim were significantly the present result indicates that the enhancement of the adenosine action by nicorandil and cromakalim appears to occur at least partly through atp-sensitive k+ channel
the generalizability of cardiovascular responses across the generalizability of cardiovascular reactivity change scores remains largely in previous several factors differed between laboratory and making poor lab-to-life correlations difficult to the present study varied only one parameter between the lab and in this 24 females were studied on four twice in the lab (to provide test-retest once in a and once at after a subjects performed a math while blood pressure and heart rate were procedures were identical in all blood pressure changes were fairly reliable between the two lab with rs values (systolic) and (diastolic lab/nonlab correlations were lower for for this suggests that even a minor variation in such as a change in can affect other lab-field differences may have an even greater
electronic monitoring and antihypertensive even of mild-to-moderate is undoubtedly a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and it has been well in numerous studies that have been subjected to that the introduction of antihypertensive treatment leads to reductions in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular these results can be obtained with even a moderate reduction in blood of the order of 4-5 mmhg in diastolic blood many studies have shown that the percentage of treated hypertensive individuals who have a reduction in blood pressure to normal values of systolic blood pressure/ diastolic blood pressure (< 140/90 mmhg) is of the order of the reduction in blood pressure data are well correlated with the level of this compliance can be defined as the adherence by the patient to the directions given by the doctor for medication and this can be considered as when it is of the order of until recently the examination of compliance relied on questioning the pill counts or ultimately blood sampling for drug which could be used only in the use of an electronic pill box with a microprocessor in the cover that records the date and hour each time the box is opened is a precise method of recording the purpose of such a method is to study overall which deteriorates as time passes and falls by approximately 50% after 1 this compliance can be modified and improved if instruction and follow-up are given to the prescription compliance can be improved by once daily dosing and by instructing for this to be taken in the in contrast compliance is considerably reduced when more than two doses are to be taken each using the pill counting box allows us to describe and focus on different types of ranging from rigidly adherent to completely it seems that factors such as age and activity can influence these patterns of

local cerebral blood flow autoregulation following cerebral venous occlusion in the maintenance of cerebral blood flow (cbf) autoregulation in the brain is of major importance for patient outcome in various clinical the authors assessed local autoregulation after cortical vein in wistar a single cortical vein was occluded photochemically by using rose bengal and fiberoptic in rats with bilateral carotid artery mean arterial blood pressure (mabp) was lowered in 5-mm hg increments down to 40 mm hg by using hypobaric local cbf at each pressure level was assessed by performing laser doppler (ld) scanning at 25 (5 x 5) locations within bilateral cranial in this the lower limit of autoregulation (lla) was the lla was 60 mm hg in both right and left hemispheres in group a (five in which the animals received illumination without rose bengal and had no venous of the 11 rats that underwent vein three developed severe reductions in local cbf and/or a growing venous thrombus and were distinguished as group c three from previous work we know that those animals are bound to experience venous the remaining rats formed group b eight in this group the lla remained at 60 mm hg in the left hemisphere without in the right cortex with the occluded the lla was found to be 65 mm below a carotid stump pressure of 25 mm hg regional cbf in the affected hemisphere dropped more abruptly to a possibly ischemic range than that in the opposite normal the results of the present study suggest that cerebral venous circulation disorders are manifested via additional that from a partially impaired local autoregulation in the vicinity of the occluded even under conditions in which the vein occlusion itself does not cause brain care should be taken in the control of blood pressure in patients with this pathological
role of sympathetic nervous system in hypertension and effects of cardiovascular the sympathetic nervous system (sns) plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac performance and peripheral changes in sns activity measured as catecholamines in plasma or organ spillover have been implicated in the pathogenesis of recent studies using microneurography to directly assess peripheral sympathetic nerve activity have demonstrated an increase in sympathetic activity in patients with borderline hypertension at rest and during we have recently shown that resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity is comparable in offspring of hypertensive and normotensive during mental arithmetic the increase in muscle sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure was significantly more pronounced in offspring of hypertensive than in offspring of normotensive but resting blood pressure was in the normotensive range and comparable in both these data indicate that the response to mental stress results in a more pronounced activation of sns in normotensive subjects with a genetic background of in other cardiovascular disease states such as acute myocardial infarction and heart failure activity of the sns may determine prognosis some calcium antagonists which are successfully used to treat patients with hypertension and stable angina pectoris may have unfavourable effects in patients with impaired left ventricular this could be due in part to baroreceptor-mediated activation of the an effect which seems to be related to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the in angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors seem to directly decrease sympathetic nerve this may explain at least in part their beneficial effects in patients with impaired left ventricular the sns as a regulator of the cardiovascular system also plays an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction and heart drug therapy could have a significant impact on the activity of the
a limited renal injury may cause a permanent form of neurogenic we have shown that an acute injury to the kidney produced by an intrarenal injection of phenol causes an immediate increase in blood pressure and in norepinephrine (ne) secretion from the posterior the studies suggest that in this model afferent impulses from the kidney to central integrative structures in the brain may be responsible for the increase in blood to further evaluate whether a renal injury caused by the intrarenal injection of phenol leads to a permanent elevation of blood pressure and whether this is mediated by increased sympathetic nervous system we examined the chronic effects (4 weeks) of an intrarenal injection of 50 microl of 10% phenol on blood pressure and ne secretion from the posterior systolic blood pressure increased from 128 +/- to 176 +/- mm hg (p < 4 weeks after receiving the intrarenal injection of but it did not change in rats that received the vehicle (128 +/- and 135 +/- mm hg) and in rats that were subjected to renal denervation (127 +/- and 124 +/- mm the secretion of ne from the posterior hypothalamic nuclei was greater (p < in rats that received phenol (253 +/- pg/ml) than in controls (158 +/- pg/ml) and denervated rats (170 +/- these studies have shown that a limited injury to one kidney may cause a permanent elevation of blood pressure and this is associated with increased sympathetic nervous system
effects of the at1 antagonist hr 720 in comparison to losartan on stimulated sympathetic blood and heart rate in pithed spontaneously hypertensive it has been demonstrated in isolated organs that angiotensin ii mediates catecholamine release via presynaptically located at1 receptor in the present the relevance of at1-mediated noradrenaline and adrenaline release in a whole-animal which reflects the peripherally sympathetic system (pithed was the effects of a new at1 hr are demonstrated with respect to its pre- and postsynaptic actions in comparison to the at1 antagonist dose-response curves to angiotensin ii of blood pressure show a tenfold higher potency for hr 720 to compete for angiotensin thereby decreasing the maximum effects when compared with the electrically induced sympathetic outflow resulted in a dose-dependent increase after angiotensin ii it could markedly be reduced with both at1 whereby hr 720 again was ten times more potent than neither with hr 720 nor with losartan an agonistic activity could be the results indicate an at1 receptor subtype mediated release of catecholamines in a whole-animal hr 720 is ten times more potent than the at1 antagonist losartan and acts in a noncompetitive

hemodynamic response to vasopressin in dehydrated human despite the known potent vasoconstrictor effects of the role of this hormone in the maintenance of blood pressure is incompletely in studies performed in animals with increased plasma vasopressin several complex cardiovascular effects have been including decreases in heart rate and cardiac which may account for a lack of effect on arterial pressure despite the vasopressin-induced increase in total peripheral only a few studies have been done to assess the cardiovascular effects of vasopressin in human and most of these have been limited to measurement of heart rate and arterial pressure the present study was designed to identify more fully the cardiovascular effects of vasopressin when plasma vasopressin concentrations are increased by osmotic stimulation without the superimposition of major nonosmotic stimuli associated with severe volume studies were performed on 11 normal human subjects in supine and erect posture before and after 24 hours of fluid and following administration of a selective v1 receptor after cardiovascular parameters were measured noninvasively by thoracic electrical bioimpedance cardiography and blood samples for measurements of plasma concentrations of vasopressin and other hormones affected by dehydration and differences in posture were collected for subsequent after 24 hours of fluid plasma osmolality was increased from 287 +/- to 294 +/- mosm/kg h20 and plasma vasopressin concentrations (pavp) were increased in both supine and erect mean arterial (map) and systolic blood pressure (sbp) were reduced by fluid restriction but were higher in erect than in supine posture both before and after fluid heart rate diastolic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (svri) were also higher in erect than in supine while cardiac index stroke index end-diastolic index and an index of total thoracic fluid content (tfc) were all reduced in erect both before and after plasma renin activity (pra) and plasma norepinephrine concentrations (pne) were increased in erect both before and after but there was no effect of erect posture on plasma vasopressin concentrations either before or after administration of the v1 receptor antagonist after dehydration had no effect on hemodynamic parameters other than small reductions in dbp and cardiac it is concluded from these studies that small increases in pavp associated with moderate dehydration do not play a role in the maintenance of arterial pressure in normal human subjects in either supine or erect
