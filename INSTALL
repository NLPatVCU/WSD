TESTING PLATFORMS
    UMLS-SenseRelate has been developed and tested on Linux and Solaris,
    primarily using Perl and the C shell (csh).

REQUIREMENTS
    UMLS-SenseRelate REQUIRES that the following software be installed. More
    details on how to obtain and install appear below.

    --Programming Languages Perl (version 5.8.5 or better)

    --CPAN modules UMLS::Interface UMLS::Similarity

PROGGRAMMING LANGUAGES
  Perl (version 5.8.5 or better)
    Perl is freely available at:

    It is very likely that you will already have Perl installed if you are
    using a Unix/Linux based system.

CPAN MODULES
  UMLS-Interface
    Please see the UMLS-Interface documentation.

  UMLS-Similarity
    Please see the UMLS-Similarity documentation.

INSTALLATION
  UMLS::SenseRelate
    If you have supervisor access, or have configured MCPAN for local
    install, you can install via:

     perl -MCPAN -e shell
     > install UMLS-SenseRelate

    If not, you can, "manually" install by downloading the *.tar.gz file,
    unpacking, and executing the following commands.

                    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/programs LIB=/home/lib
                    make
                    make test
                    make install

    Note that the PREFIX and LIB settings are just examples to help you
    create a local install, if you do not have supervisor (su) access.

    You must include /home/lib in your PERL5LIB environment variable to
    access this module when running.

    If you have the super-user access, then you can install UMLS-SenseRelate
    into system directories via : perl Makefile.PL make make install make
    clean

    The exact location of where UMLS-SenseRelate will be installed depends
    on your system configuration. A message will be printed out after 'make
    install' telling your exactly where it was installed.

  External Programs
    To use the umls-senserelate-evaluation.pl program, you must install the
    scorer2 program from the SemEval 2010 All Words Disambiguation Task. To
    do this, there is an install.sh script in the External directory. This
    script takes a install location as input and installs the scorer2
    program in that location. For example:

        install.sh /home/bridget/programs/bin

    Please ensure that this path is in your PATH environment variable. For
    example:

          # in cshell
          setenv PATH /home/bridget/programs/bin/:$PATH

          # in bash
          export PATH=/home/bridget/programs/bin/:$PATH

        This can be added to your .cshrc or .bashrc file
