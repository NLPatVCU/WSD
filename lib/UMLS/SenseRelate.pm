=head1 NAME

UMLS::SenseRelate - A suit of Perl modules that implement the 
senserelate word sense disambiguation algorithm using the semantic 
similarity and relatedness options from the UMLS::Similarity package. 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use UMLS::Interface;
 use UMLS::Similarity;
 use UMLS::SenseRelate::TargetWord;

 #  initialize option hash and umls
 my %option_hash = ();
 my $umls        = "";
 my $meas        = "";
 my $senserelate = "";
 my %params      = ();
 
 #  set interface     
 $option_hash{"t"} = 1;
 $option_hash{"realtime"} = 1;
 $umls = UMLS::Interface->new(\%option_hash);

 #  set measure
 use UMLS::Similarity::path;
 $meas = UMLS::Similarity::path->new($umls);

 #  set senserelate
 $params{"measure"} = "path";

 $senserelate = UMLS::SenseRelate::TargetWord->new($umls, $meas, \%params); 

 #  set the target word
 my $tw = "adjustment";        

 #  provide an instance where the target word is in <head> tags
 my $instance = "Fifty-three percent of the subjects reported below average ";
    $instance .= "marital <head>adjustment</head>.";

 my ($hashref) = $senserelate->assignSense($tw, $instance, undef); 

 if(defined $hashref) {
    print "Target word ($tw) was assigned the following sense(s):\n";
    foreach my $sense (sort keys %{$hashref}) {  
      print "  $sense\n"; 
    }
 }
 else {
    print "Target word ($tw) has no senses.\n";
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package consists of the UMLS::SenseRelate::TargetWord module which 
performs target word sense disambugation using the semantic similarity 
and relatedness measure in the UMLS::Similarity package.
