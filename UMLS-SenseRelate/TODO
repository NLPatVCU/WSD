NAME
    Todo List for UMLS-SenseRelate

SYNOPSIS
    Plans for future versions of UMLS-SenseRelate

TO DO LIST
    1. add additional tests in t/

    2. add a cache to the all words disambiguation programs similar to that
    in the target word disambiguation programs

    3. mmxml format runs rather slow -- I think this could be speed up

    4. I keep thinking that for all words disambiguation we could treat this
    as a graph problem. We have possible senses for each term in the
    abstract, the possible senses and the terms are linked together based on
    their similarity scores -- can we use a graph algorithm to find the
    global maximum for all the scores? I don't know if I am stating this
    clearly.

    5. Explore using vector. I think a different vector matrix files will be
    needed when using the biomedical data though. I would suggest looking at
    the bigram counts of Medline provided by the library.

    6. We have not looked at combining sources which I think this could lend
    itself to nicely -- especially with the NLM-WSD dataset because not all
    possible senses of a target word are in a single source.

    7. Ted has mentioned using viterbi -- I wonder if this is along the same
    lines of the graph idea from (4).

    8. incorporate intrinsic information content measures
