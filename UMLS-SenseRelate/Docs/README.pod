=head1  UMLS::SenseRelate

=head2 SYNOPSIS

This package consists of a set of Perl modules along with supporting
Perl programs that perform the task of Word Sense Disambiguation. The
program(s) attempt to disambiguate the sense of a single target word in
a given context using measures of similarity and relatedness provided by 
the UMLS::Similarity CPAN module. 

=head2 INSTALL

    To install these modules run:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    This will install the modules in the standard locations. You will, 
    most probably, require root privileges to install in standard system
    directories. To install in a non-standard directory, specify a prefix
    during the 'perl Makefile.PL' stage as:

      perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home

=head2 CONTENTS

       lib/	

       	 Location of the UMLS::SenseRelate::TargetWord perl module. 
       	 Location of the UMLS::SenseRelate::AllWords perl module. 

       t/	

         Location of the test programs

       samples/

	  A directory of scripts that demonstrate SenseClusters' usage and
          functionality.

       External/

	  Contains a modified version of SemEval 2010 All Words Disambigation
	  scorering program , and a script that can be run to automatically 
	  install it. This is used by the umls-senserelate-evaluation.pl 
	  program

       utils/
       
          Directory containing Perl utility programs. These utilities use 
	  the UMLS::SenseRelate modules and provide some supporting
	  functionality.


=head2 MEASURES

UMLS-SenseRelate disambiguates terms in running text using the measures 
implemented in the UMLS-Similarity packages. Currently the following 
measures are available:

    lch    - Leacock & Chodorow (1998)
    wup    - Wu & Palmer (1994)
    nam    - Nguyen and Al-Mubaid  (2006) 
    zhong  - Zhong, et al. 2002
    cdist  - Rada, et. al. 1989
    jcn    - Jiang & Conrath (1997) 
    res    - Resnik (1995)
    lin    - Lin (1998) 
    lesk   - Banerjee and Pedersen(2002)
    vector - Patwardhan and Pedersen (2006)
    path   - a simple path  based measure.              

=head2 CONFIGURATION FILE

UMLS-SenseRelate passes the UMLS-Similarity package a configuration 
file which allows a specified set of sources and relations to be used 
when calculating the similarity score between two CUIs. 

There are six configuration options: SAB, REL, RELA, SABDEF, 
RELDEF, and RELADEF. 

The SAB and REL options are used to determine which sources and 
relations the path information is to be obtained from. The RELA 
option narrows down the relation even further. The RELA will only 
be applied to the PAR/CHD and RB/RN relations. 

The SABDEF and RELDEF options are used to determine which sources 
and relations to use when creating the Extended Definition. The 
RELA option narrows down the relation even further. The RELADEF 
will only be applied to the PAR/CHD and RB/RN relations. 

The path, wup, lch, lin, jcn and res measures require the SAB and 
REL options to be set. There is also an optional RELA option.

The vector and lesk measures require the SABDEF and RELDEF options 
to be set with an optional RELADEF. 

You can specify a single source, multiple sources or the entire 
UMLS (using the UMLS_ALL option). Keep in mind that the greater 
the number of sources the larger the search space so if you 
obtaining path information about two concepts this will take 
longer. The names of the sources in the configuration file are 
expected to be in the SAB (source abbreviation) form. A listing 
of the sources and their SABs can be found:

<http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/knowledge_sources/metathesaurus/release/source_vocabularies.html>

You can specify any relations that exist in the specified set 
of sources that you defined. The directional (hierarchical) 
relations though are PAR/CHD and RB/RN. The other relations 
(such as RO and SIB) are not directional which means when 
obtaining path information when using these relations may 
take much longer than obtaining path  information using the 
directional relations. A listing of the different relations 
can be found here (scroll down to the REL table):

<http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/knowledge_sources/metathesaurus/release/abbreviations.html>

If you do plan on using a multiple sources or the entire UMLS, we 
would advise you to use the --realtime option which is explained 
below, in the Interface.pm documentation and the path programs in 
the utils/ directory. We also have a am UMLS_ALL option for this 
so you do not have to specify each and every source and relation. 

The format of the configuration file is as follows:

SAB :: <include|exclude> <source1, source2, ... sourceN>

REL :: <include|exclude> <relation1, relation2, ... relationN>

RELA :: <include|exclude> <rela1, rela2, ... relaN>

For example, if we wanted to use the MSH vocabulary with only 
the RB/RN relations, the configuration file would be:

 SAB :: include MSH
 REL :: include RB, RN

or 

 SAB :: include MSH
 REL :: exclude PAR, CHD

If we wanted to use the SNOMEDCT vocabulary with only the PAR/CHD 
relations that are is-a relations, the configuration file would be:

 SAB :: include SNOMEDCT
 REL :: include PAR, CHD 
 RELA :: include isa, inverse_isa


The format for SABDEF and RELDEF is similar. 

The SABDEF and RELDEF options are used to determine the sources 
and relations the extended definition is to be obtained from. 

The format of the configuration file is as follows:

SABDEF :: <include|exclude> <source1, source2, ... sourceN>

RELDEF :: <include|exclude> <relation1, relation2, ... relationN>

RELADEF :: <include|exclude> <rela1, rela2, ... relaN>

Note: RELDEF takes any of MRREL relations and two special 'relations':

      1. CUI which refers to the CUIs definition

      2. TERM which refers to the terms associated with the CUI

For example, if we wanted to use the definitions from MSH vocabulary 
and we only wanted the definition of the CUI and the definitions of the 
CUIs SIB relation, the configuration file would be:

 SABDEF :: include MSH
 RELDEF :: include CUI, SIB

If you wanted only the PAR/CHD definitions which are is-a relations. 

 SABDEF :: include MSH
 RELDEF :: include PAR, CHD
 RELADEF :: include isa, inverse_isa

For all of these options, there is an UMLS_ALL tag. If used with 
SAB or SABDEF, it would include all of the UMLS sources. If used 
with the REL or RELDEF, it would include all of the possible 
relations (as well as CUI and TERM for RELDEF). If used with the 
RELA or RELADEF, it would include all of the RELA relations including 
those with no RELA relation. Note that this is also the default for 
this option which is why it is optional. An example of using the 
UMLS_ALL option is as follows:

 SAB :: include UMLS_ALL
 REL :: include UMLS_ALL

and another is:

 SABDEF :: include UMLS_ALL
 RELDEF :: include UMLS_ALL

If you go to the configuration file directory, there will 
be example configuration files for the different runs that 
you have performed.

For more information about the configuration options please 
see the README.
