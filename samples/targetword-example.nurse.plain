Promoting motivation towards community health care: a qualitative study from nurses in Pakistan. Based on the extensive health care needs of Pakistani population, the idea of Community Health Nursing was introduced in 1985. The educational nursing institutes adopted nursing curriculum in order to produce competent nurses to meet the rising demands of society. However, very few numbers of nurses choose community health nursing as their career pathway in Pakistan. Based on the current observation, enhancing motivation among graduate nurses has always been viewed as a great challenge for the academic nursing institutions. This study was intended to explore motivating and de motivating factors in nurses towards community Health_Nursing. By utilizing self concept based model of motivation, semi structured interviews were conducted with newly graduated nurses, <head item="nurse" instance="20527656" sense="C0028661" candidates="C0006147,C0015538,C0028661">nurse</head> educators and nursing students.

[Triage in acute medical admission units]INTRODUCTION: Many emergency departments use validated triage tools. It is currently undocumented if such a practice is common in Danish medical admission units (MAU). The current study was conducted in order to clarify this. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Questionnaire survey with data collected from the intern on call at the medical departments of all Danish hospitals listed on sundhed.dk. RESULTS: We received 87 answers from 60 individual MAUs covered by a total of 83 interns on call. The MAUs had a median of eight beds and 14 admissions a day. An intern was on call 24 hours a day at 95% of the MAUs. At 87% of the MAUs, a doctor was contacted by the admitting physician, while the contact was the responsibility of a <head item="nurse" instance="20525464" sense="C0028661" candidates="C0006147,C0015538,C0028661">nurse</head> in 13% of MAUs. None of the contacted MAUs used a validated triage tool and 95% answered that they triaged on the basis of individual clinical_assessment of patients. However, 22% answered that selected groups of patients were routinely assessed by a senior physician. CONCLUSION: None of the Danish MAUs uses a validated triage tool to prioritize acutely admitted medical patients.
